I think the majority of Gotham's problems could've solved with smart investments in social programs and industry and the police force which Bruce has money for. 

He already invests a ton of money in local charities. In fact in the most recent movie it's explained that he bankrolls the orphanage that Joseph Gordon Levitt's character comes from. He even gives his mansion away when he does his disappearing act.

How naive are superheros when same villains keep coming back. Considering his track record, you think he really can't his stance on the not killing rule.

There are very few superheroes that do allow themselves to kill their nemeses. Ignoring the fact that it would make the comics all kinds of boring if all the bad guys died every few issues, is this something you have against all heroes, or just batman? 

&gt;And even when it comes to I dunno fighting regular crime, I'm pretty sure a neighborhood watch group and 100 patrolmen would do a much better job than one guy flying around million dollar super planes.

You'd think, but historically that hasn't been the case. The bad guys in this town have technology that full SWAT teams can't even begin to compete with and have incredible invulerabilities in some cases that prevent bullets from hurting them. When you've got your city crawling with bad guys that have access to freeze rays, mind control, invincibility, etc. Even one guy who is willing to unfailingly put his life on the line to protect everyone from them is better than 100 who won't or cant. 

And even if you did find more than a handful who were willing to risk their lives on a nightly basis, what are the chances that any of them would be even one fifth as physically capable as Bruce wayne? His money allows him the freedom of having most of his day open for training even day of the week so he can always be in peak physical condition.","&gt;I think the majority of Gotham's problems could've solved with smart investments in social programs and industry and the police force which Bruce has money for.

You'd think that, but you'd be wrong. Bruce Wayne does that. He is painted as the ultra-philanthropist, and as much as he gives, the city won't stop producing super-villains.

&gt;I swear the guy is anonymous being Batman, which means he can get away with killing, which would solve all his super villian issues immediately. How naive are superheros when same villains keep coming back.

There are two answers here: The justice system is failing Batman and Gotham, as they should be executing the repeat offenders rather than sentencing them to Arkham Asylum.

The second is that nobody dies in comic books, so it's a pretty crapsack universe that the heroes only make better as much as they can.

&gt;And even when it comes to I dunno fighting regular crime, I'm pretty sure a neighborhood watch group and 100 patrolmen would do a much better job than one guy flying around million dollar super planes.

Except they don't. Batman's superpower isn't his money, it's the fact that he can take beatings that would kill a normal human, and keep coming. A neighborhood watch couldn't hang in Gotham, where the problem is primarily organized crime. They'd either be bought off, intimidated, or killed.

I believe that it doesn't matter what you do in life. Well, not in the big scheme of things anyway. Human endeavors such as developing a cure for cancer or ending world hunger are all very noble, but futile nonetheless. Maybe we'll get there someday, but does it matter? For now it seems like it does, but when our species dies out it won't. God probably doesn't exist and nobody gives a shit.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","'Human existence is futile.' But to find meaning is what makes us human. To be an animal without hope of overcoming death is certainly meaningless.

As animals it isn't logical to think we were 'cursed' with the knowledge of our own future demise. 

We fear death in the same way we fear pain: it motivates us to do something other than bang our heads against the wall. In order to escape the fear of death we seek transcendence; we raise children or create art to effect the next generation. Example: the 'mid-life crises' is caused by 1) getting older 2) feeling you haven't influenced the next generation positively. Some people try to 'make themselves feel younger' via sportscars, drinking, etc. which always fails.

Being a mere beast is futile.","So, I think ""meaning"" is kind of just a byproduct of our evolution. Because, the way you're talking about it is sort of the way most people address this concept, like it's some sort of transcendent sentiment, that there's a purpose that can exist forever and we're not a part of it and that eternal purpose is the only important thing.

But, I mean, that's just some feeling that we have, like envy or boredom. ""Meaning"" the concept as opposed to ""meaning"" the feeling, as far as I can see, has no need to be attached or correlated to some arbitrary concept like ""time.""

You know when you're sorta YouTube surfing and you start on some silly video and later end up on a 2 hour documentary on some huge scientific conquest we've done in the last decade sometimes? Or sometimes, it's the opposite, but often, you'll watch a video about puppies playing patty cake with cats and then suddenly **here's all the physics ever.** (EDIT: So re-reading this, I realized that at this part, I accidentally did it in the same order twice so it's not the opposite at all but I'm sure reddit will forgive me just like they forgave that one guy who misspelled his name)

One of those videos I watched, I think, was about what's outside our observable universe. It started out with stuff outside of what we can see because of expansion, and that was like ""meh"" because it was mostly, as far as we can tell, just our stuff, same composition, pretty uniform except for some cold spot that could be evidence of a multiverse or something. And then they started talking about the multiverse. And how there are totally different temporal dimensions that our temporal dimension exists in and how our ""forward"" in time is ""up"" one level up or some crazy arbitrary dimension.

Like, you just sorta realize that time is **totally and completely arbitrary.** People put so much emphasis on time being such a huge thing, like if we don't last until the end of the universe in 10^gazillion millennia or whatever they calculated it to be, we don't matter, but no, it's just another arbitrary dimension, it's like saying that unless I'm really, really fat, I don't matter and I'm totally meaningless because I don't take up as much space in this dimension.

###So...
___

Being dependent on time is so, so arbitrary. Time is just a randomass mechanic that our minds just sorta found it convenient to interpret. I mean, everything about our universe is just interpretations. These colors are just radiation. There's radiation going directly into my eyes right now and some physical law has allowed a mysterious thing called consciousness to emerge from the soup inside my head to make what we call an image out of that. Time is like color, we're just looking at entropy and somehow, the evidence of less entropic states enters each of our consicous states in order to make memories.

My take on this is if there is a meaning out there, you wouldn't know. Meaning, as far as I can define it, is ability to have some sort of effect. I'm not sure if logic even exists outside of our universe, like I don't know if true and false are just suddenly not the only states of things outside here, but as far as I can tell, the best definition is having an effect, and when you have rigorous laws and logic, everything you do affects everything. The universe is just a structure, time included, just like a bunch of blocks you put together to make a Jenga tower that relies on every piece to stay up except Jenga is literally the opposite of that, but everyone always uses it as a metaphor for engineering so w/e. That's what Chaos theory is, if you change anything or remove anyone, suddenly the universe doesn't exist. It's gone. If someone from outside the universe came in and made you not exist, literally the ENTIRE UNIVERSE is gone. Aliens outside of our observable universe but still in our universe would just, without even knowing why, also stop existing because they rely on your existence.

That's fucking crazy, like, right now, some pregnant alien overlord is worried about their leadership and their baby and they're not worried about me at all, but if it weren't for me RIGHT FUCKING NOW being a thing, they would be freaking DEAD. They don't even KNOW.

I'm not even sure I'm trying to change your mind at this point, I started typing and then I just got really enthusiastic, but yeah, you really should realize that

###TL;DR (Honestly, don't read the above, it's a ramble because I fucked up and I'm too lazy to fix it)

""not lasting forever means we're meaningless"" is so super duper arbitrary when you realize how non-unique and special time is. It's just, like, another thing. Like a burger. It's like saying if I don't always have everything to do with this burger, I am meaningless, from cow to slaughter to consumption. Why a burger? Why not a sandwich? Or a late night television show? At the very least, if we're meaningless, it's not because we won't last forever.",B,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a more in-depth and philosophical exploration of the concept of meaning and existence, delving into the arbitrary nature of time and the interconnectedness of all things in the universe. The user also uses creative analogies and examples to illustrate their points, making the argument more engaging and thought-provoking. Reply B encourages the original poster to consider a different perspective on the concept of meaning and existence, which may lead them to reevaluate their initial views on the subject."
predict-explain,"I think the real reason people punish others for transgressions is not so much to discourage the behavior, but rather to channel humanity's inherently predatory nature in a way that's socially acceptable and does not contradict with the moral values we have invented (or discovered, depending on how you look at it).

Most people feel a smug sense of satisfaction if they hear about a bully being beat up, or a murderer being executed by the state. Humans, being predatory creatures, have a certain sense of bloodlust and channeling this predatory instinct towards people who are predatory allows them to continue to view themselves as not being predators, while still enjoying violence.

Even bullies often justify their torments of victims as a form of punishment for not fitting the social norms, being ""annoying"" or acting in a way that is in their eyes unacceptable. Serial killers also often see their acts as a sort of punishment towards humanity. Rapists are often motivated by a desire to punish women. It seems like evil deeds are often motivated by a perverted sense of justice rather than mere selfishness or greed.

Another reason I think punishment has more to do with humans enjoying violence than it does with stopping bad behavior is the fact that corporal punishment of children is still very popular and defended by the majority of adults. I always felt like my parents took pleasure in punishing me, so I may be biased, but I really do think parents spank their children more out of anger and frustration than out of a will to help them develop.

Another reason I think it's innate is because the moral goodness of punishment is something virtually everybody agrees on. Liberals and conservatives alike usually have a ""tough on crime"" stance and would rather a violent criminal receive a harsh punishment even if it's more expensive and makes them less likely to be rehabilitated, than a lesser punishment that rehabilitated them more effectively. This sentiment is prevalent in every culture, even in societies like Scandinavia where the laws are more lenient.

We punish people because we perceive them as ""deserving it"" ie, we despise them and lust for their blood because we perceive them as being no longer part of the same species, and something that needs to be predated upon for the benefit of the community.

I actually think if there was no prison or capital punishment it would have very little effect on crime rates. The few people who are truly serial offenders could just be put in hospitals and the rest will eventually be released from prison anyway and will be far crazier on release after spending decades in the pen.

In a nutshell, I think punishment has actually caused far more evil than it's prevented and is really just an outlet for our inherent cruelty as a meat-eating species at the top of the food chain. Punishing people we consider ""bad"" also has the effect of affirming our own self righteousness.

predict-explain,"Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of being in the main stream, I'm still not convinced that vaccines are all they are cracked up to be. 

Between whistle blowers (William Thomson, Scott Cooper, Andrew Wakefield etc) and corruption within the vaccine industry, it seems like something sinister is afoot. There are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest.

Please change my view.","&gt;Andrew Wakefield 

Wakefield's claims were fraudulent. The journals that covered his articles pulled them after it was discovered that he accepted money from interested parties. He actually lost his medical license over it. 

Thompson's findings only showed an increased risk after multiple subset limitations. This makes the conclusion highly unreliable (the raw data did *not* support a link between Vaccines and Autism).

There is a vast medical consensus that vaccines are safe and effective. The fact is, there really isn't a controversy in medically knowledgable spheres. It's only the uneducated, following charlatans that has created an *illusion* of controversy (in a very similar manner to climate change deniers). Always look at *where* the controversy is coming from.  

&gt;There are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest.

Research some of the diseases these vaccines cured and then talk about ""horror stories"". The rare harm that vaccines cause is far outweighed by the elimination of the diseases.

That's not to say that the vaccine (and larger medical) industry is entirely without issue, but there is no reputable organization that doubts a) the effectiveness of vaccines or b) the general (not perfect) safety.

It may be helpful to know what exactly you think is wrong with vaccines, so we can narrow the articles we show you.","&gt;  Between whistle blowers (William Thomson, Scott Cooper, Andrew Wakefield etc) and corruption within the vaccine industry, it seems like something sinister is afoot. There are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest.


The problem with this argument is that it is open ended and not grounded in a fact or idea.  It is as hard to dispute it as it is to dispute the comment *""I am scared""*.  

Whistle-blowers are essential to keep groups honest.  It doesn't mean that the whole system is better off gone.  It only means that there are more flaws than an entity would otherwise acknowledge.  I'm not familiar with everyone on the list, but considering that Obama immediately granted William Thompson immunity from any crimes for testifying clearly indicates that we're not looking at a conspiracy. He spoke out and he was encouraged to do so.

&gt;  Now I'm not antivaccine (although I haven't been immunized yet) I'm just not pro vaccine. I haven't seen enough to discredit this dark side of things and show undoubtedly that vaccinations are the way to go.


As /u/amazingmrbrock pointed out in what might be deemed *the laziest CMV comment in history* there's more at stake than what you can plainly see.  Specifically Herd Immunity.  That means that we are communally protected from diseases because they are less prevalent.  So for instance, babies younger than 1 year old or the elderly with weakened immune systems may not be able to be vaccinated.  However the lack of prevalence of the disease in society makes it that they are still safe.  So being vaccinated is not just about saving your life but it is about saving the lives of others around you.


Separately, it is important not to look at public policy from an empirical perspective.  Everyone will always know of a story about someone who suffered in some way.  This only points out that a system is not perfect, which was never really in contention. The only question is if the system is better than the lack of a system.  Which *statistics* do a much better job at proving.  Looking at the [Anti-vaccine Body count](http://www.antivaccinebodycount.com/Anti-Vaccine_Body_Count/Home.html) we can see staggering numbers in preventable diseases and deaths.  

If vaccines caused autism or had similar effects, then surely it would be measurable in a similar way.  We could reconcile that data against each other.

predict-explain,"The state of Palestine has 4 million people residing within Isreal. The West Bank and Gaza strip together have 6,000 square kilometers of land. The North Sinai Governorate alone has 27,000 square Kilometers of land, that's more land than even Isreal has (22,000 sq km).

[Here is what a State of Palestine could look like on a map, either with only the Northern part or the full peninsula.](http://sinaimaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/governorates-sinai-egypt.jpg)

One could argue that the Sinai Peninsula is mostly desert and unfit for people to live in, but Israel was mostly desert when they began immigrating to the region too. Irrigation, agriculture, forestry, and artificial canals have been known to combat or reverse desertification.

The people already residing there can be promised equal citizenship rights in the new state of Palestine. Egypt could even allow for the people there to have duel citizenship, so that they can choose to either stay in the new state or easily move to inland Egypt. If necessary, Egypt could offer incentives for Sinai people to move inland prior to the establishment of the state.

If a ""buffer"" line/zone were felt to be necessary, it could be jointly run by Israel and Egypt stationed outside the borders without much issue from the Palestinians. The U.N. Security council could send peacekeepers to the peninsula to monitor the region's development. There would be very little reason for any of the Security members to veto this decision if Egypt, Israel, and Palestine all agreed to this.

Albeit, it's extremely unlikely this will ever happen, but I think it would be a good solution. Which is why I'm here, what is wrong with this plan?

**Edit:** Added what can happen with the people already living there.","One basic way of refuting this idea is by simply looking at the current situation in the Sinai Peninsula. 



First, the region has always been populated by people. The native bedouin people have lived in that region far longer than you seem to be giving them credit for. Most of them migrated there between 1300 and 1700. Quite a long time for a place that so inhospitable. 

Also, Israel might have been ""mostly dessert"" but the whole reason we need a Palestine state is because of the millions of people the Israel state forced into refugee status by making them leave. It might have been mostly dessert, but damn, it was home to a lot of people. 

Egypt certainly could offer the things you mentioned to the Bedouin people. Egypt has abjectly refused to do so, and has created a terrible caste system whereby terrorist groups have thrived in the region, so I do not see this happening anytime soon. But sure, in a perfect world, that could theoretically happen. (Are you familiar at all with what is going on in this region??, are we talking about the same Egypt, the northern Africa country that has gone through three leaders in the past five years? The one with the pyramids?)

I'm not even sure I want to talk about a buffer zone right now. Its late, and the current buffer zone is being executed so terribly and horrendously right now that I do not think that term should be uttered in geopolitical conversations concerning this region. 

I guess more than anything I am confused by your view prompt. Are you saying that if the things you mentioned happened that a Palestine state could thrive? 

I mean if the planets align and ponies sprout wings with rainbows coming out their butts, then yea sure this might happen. I would rather you suggest Utah as a solution, or maybe suggest building an island in the middle of the ocean out of old two litter bottles of soda. At least then, there is a more realistic possibility.","1) What do you propose is done with the West Bank?

2) Even ignoring the difficulty of actually growing crops in the Sinai, Israeli efforts to reduce desertification were possible only due to large amounts of foreign funds and resources that poured into the state after its foundation. The Palestinian diaspora has no such source of funding, hence it is doubtful that they would be able to actually water in a climate that is even more harsh than Israel's is, on average.

3) Israel is generally thought of as being one of the most over-populated areas in the world, relative to it's carrying capacity. It is possible that global warming will exacerbate the issue along with the changing climate, and this would also likely apply to the Palestinian Sinai.

4) Egypt won't sign on to it because it weakens their hold over the Suez Canal by putting a foreign nation on the other bank pretty close to the canal.

5) Palestine won't sign on to it because, let's face it, they just won't. You're implicitly saying that the Palestinians should be forced to move out of their present lands for no reason other than their own ethnicity.

6) Israel won't sign on to it because lately the Israeli government has been against the establishment of any Arab Palestinian government in the region.",B,A,"I would say Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides specific points addressing the feasibility and practicality of the proposed solution, such as the lack of funding for irrigation efforts in the harsh climate of the Sinai Peninsula, the overpopulation issues in Israel and how they might apply to a Palestinian Sinai, and the geopolitical implications for both Egypt and Palestine. These specific arguments make a stronger case against the original poster's proposal compared to the more general criticisms in Reply A.

predict-explain,"Bar soap is all you need.

And you dont wash your hair at all, you just rinse it. 

Sometimes I use shampoo, maybe once in a month or two, if I did something specially dirty or got chemicals in my hair etc. But your hair is healthier without it, and if I cared enough to find an alternative I would use something natural.

If you quit using shampoo, your hair might be greasy for the first couple days, but with nothing but proper rinsing your hair will be able to clean itself.

Face wash is unnecessary as well. Bar soap is fine. Special body washes are unnecessary. It is all a marketing ploy.

So no, just rinsing is not always sufficient. 

Bar soap is horrid for my beard. It makes it dry and brittle as well as itchy. 

It is true that daily use of shampoo is not good for hair, and that for many unless they are involved in messy activies do not actually need to shampoo more than once a week one. That truth however does not support your claim that it is wholly unnecessary. All that it takes is one instance that it is necessary to prove you wrong and I listed several.

While I do work with women (not enough men for stable work), I am proud of my ability to help men (who come to me with little or no understanding of how it all works) get better, healthier skin and hair that they can be comfortable with. 

Because it always needs to be said: Nothing stated here constitutes medical advice for a medical condition.  If you have concerns, please consult a medical professional.

Enough of the jibber-jabber...

&gt; Bar soap is all you need.

Technically, yes.  That is a cleansing agent.  It will clean you.

Specifically, no.  Different cleansers will effect different skins in different ways.  Using one that is ""right"" for you will make a MASSIVE difference.

Regarding soaps:  Differing skin types (oily, dry, acne prone, patchy, etc.) have different needs.  One of the larger factors to consider is the skins pH level - those that run more alkaline (oily, flawless skin) need to have soaps that are non-abrasive.  Bar soaps are usually more alkaline than liquid cleansers, but are not usually alkaline enough for most people.  This caused bar soaps to strip away the skins natural oils and jack the skin up by overly drying it, leading to acne and blemish spots over time.  Those with acne and patchy dry skin typically want face wash that contains sulfur or salicylic acid (reduces redness from acne), as it helps reduce oil production and keeps the size of pores down.  Those with dry skin without acne want something that keeps the moisture up (cream-based foaming cleansers work best) but is able to be effective against clogged pores.

That's just for the face.

If you want to get into the myriad of different hair types and the benefits of using product designed for those types, I could.  There are tons of things that can make a huge impact, especially for those with medium to longer hairstyles.

By the things you are saying - ""will anything clean me better than a bar of soap?""  No, not really - it won't make you less or more clean by using something else.  It will, however, be a massive benefit to those who need the benefit of using matched products.

The best example I can give you it that you claim bar soap works just fine.  With bar soaps, there is so much difference in terms of moisture control and pH that I can find something at Target that will make your face look like shit and I can also find something that will make your face feel like a velvet couch at Target.

The difference between common, conventional brands is massive.  Dove is geared to be almost pH neutral, where as Irish Spring isn't.  Not that I personally endorse either product (I don't).

Yes, there are people that have minimal effects from using specific products (usually oily skin with VERY tight pore structure), and their skin is capable of working with most everything.  Perhaps you are just one of those people.

My 20 year high school reunion is this year, and I am frequently assumed to be in my mid-to-late 20's, not 38.  I'm not baby-faced, I have skin that I take care of in a way that is beneficial to it.  My morning and evening routine takes 15 seconds, as I rarely apply cleansers to my face - just oil, specifically certified organic argan oil. That's about it for my needs, but others need to spend 5-10 minutes every day to get their skin to the point where they are happy with it.

It really is trail and error:  We gotta play around as see what works, but I can usually get it right within two shots. 

***Some things I can guess at based on your statements:***

Your hair is fine, thinner individual thickness than the average person.  It has a natural oil towards it, but not overly so. Your hair follicle distribution is probably on the thinner side naturally, not from hair loss (think ""less dense than an afro"").   Your scalp is also slightly oily, but not overly so.  If your hair is longer than 5 inches (almost a guaranteed no here), you probably have some breakage and split ends that you need haircuts every month or so to remove.  You may have a diet that is processing B vitamins (niacin, B-5, and B-12) in a higher concentration than normal and you probably are consuming solid amounts of calcium and/or silica if you are not having breakage with longer hair.

If you have long hair and white pillow cases, they will show a serious difference in coloration due to the oil being consistently applied to them.  That is assuming that you wash your pillow case once a week or less.

Your nails might be showing straight lines from the bed to the tip.
Also, your nail beds probably are damaged, and the skin around the nails are not the same level of moisture as compared to the rest of your hands.  The skin around the sides and bottom probably crack or peel back frequently.  Ask a woman if you have no idea what I am talking about what I say ""nail beds"".  

Also, obviously, I am assuming that you are a man.

Your skin is probably naturally soft, rather than leathery.  It is most likely drier than it should be, but since you rarely wash your face (if at all), you have not stripped what little natural oil is able to get to the skins surface - and it appears to be good.  You most likely have some blackheads, although they are probably quite small, and you have more of them than is considered normal in certain spots (nose, upper cheek, etc.).  If you rub your hand on your forehead, it probably releases dirt on contact (in little lines).  It also, if rubbed hard and for 5 seconds, will probably become flaky and irritated (red for longer than 20 seconds).

Also: Hair doesn't clean itself.  Nothing does.  Rinsing helps remove dirt and grime if you have naturally smooth hair.  I am guessing that you have smooth hair, without kinks.  If you don't use a cleanser, you probably are benefiting from your hairs naturally slightly oily state (which is uncommon for most people).  I actually encourage people to wash their hair 2 times a week, and to condition it 3 times a week (on average).  You don't want to strip the oils by using a cleanser, and if you do, you should always use a conditioner to replace the oils you removed.

Also, while you might be doing well with the ladies - it's not your current hygiene routine that is doing it. I would guess that you are naturally a decent guy with a positive attitude, above average intelligence and solid looks. That can overcome some things like smelly hair and a few small blackheads that you don't notice but the ladies do.

However, you could also be rich.

Anyways, the point of these products - most people need them to feel like they look their best. However, everyone can benefit from using specialized products, even those that are blessed with minimum-maintenance skin and hair. 

***Going out on a limb here and guessing your sex, age, nationality, other fun shit to guess at:***

You are a male, 16-29 (specifically 18-23), most likely Caucasian (possibly Latin or Native American, and higher chances that you are Asian), straight to wavy hair, probably with some serious Mediterranean/Balkan/Eastern European or Asian genes in the family (mostly on your mothers side if most of these guesses are right). You have dark hair, possibly black but most likely brown.  You eat very little garlic, unless served hot like soups.  You probably consume more that 2 ounces of cheese or dairy a day, or consume calcium in decent amounts - this only applies if you are over 24 years old, if not, than you may not be consuming any calcium. You have long eyelashes but not as many as everyone else, and possibly very few on your bottom eyelids.  You don't see a lot of sun compared to others your age.  You most likely work indoors and you don't have a manual labor job like construction.

Just some guesses.  Who the fuck knows.",B,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides specific examples and scenarios where using hygiene products like shampoo is necessary, which directly contradicts the original poster's claim that such products are unnecessary. Reply A also explains the purpose of using body wash and shampoo, highlighting their effectiveness in certain situations. On the other hand, Reply B goes into extensive detail about the importance of using specialized products for different skin and hair types, which may be overwhelming and not directly address the original poster's specific claims."
predict-explain,"Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said:

What happens after the honeymoon period when one person still desires sex, but their partner has lost interest (commonly referred to as a [dead bedroom](http://reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms))?

I think it's still the duty of the disinterested party to at least minimally fulfill the sexual needs of their partner, if sustaining the relationship is a priority. In bullet form, here's why:

* Each partner in the relationship is the others' only source of intimacy and sex (assuming a monogamous relationship), therefore if one partner withholds sex, the physical needs of the other is not being met. What is ultimately a chore or an inconvenience for one partner is a physiological necessity for the other.

* Compromise is fundamentally part of every aspect of a relationship, and sex is no different. I'm conflicted in my thinking on this point: No one should be made to have sex if they don't want to. However, both my SO and I do things for each other that we don't necessarily want to do because it's better for the relationship, or it makes the other happy. I don't believe sex and intimacy should be treated differently- it's reasonable to have expectations of sex as a requirement of the relationship.

Thoughts?","The problem with sex as an obligation is that it equates to a sort of penance.  No one wants to live their life in perpetual punishment for the disinterest in sex.  

Also, even if they were to agree *most people* are somewhat aware of their partner's feelings.  Having sex with a partner who performs the act with the same interest as most of us have while cleaning our bathroom is a losing proposition.  Louis CK has a great skit on [The saddest Hand job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=betkymYDzfg).  The short of it is that his wife agrees to giving him a hand job after a long time of not being sexual with him in any way.  He should feel excited, but instead he feels pathetic, rejected and resentful of her.","Sex is *not* a physiological necessity. Simple as that. It has physiological benefits, but you don't need it to survive.

Sex is, for all intents and purposes, a hobby that you share with your partner, and yes, it is fulfilling in a way that many other activities aren't, but you won't die without it. You won't get sick without it. It won't take years off your life, or even impair your psychological performance, if you aren't getting laid.

Having that fulfillment is great, but it's not a necessity in your life, and moreover it is selfish to assume that just because your partner is disinterested in sex they are also no longer in need of that fulfillment and you are somehow more entitled to it than they are.

When your partner loses interest in sex, something is probably happening with their body or their mind that should be addressed by *both* parties. If otherwise healthy, sexual people are having problems with sexual interest, the first step is not obligation-sex. It's doctors visits. Depression, high estrogen/low testosterone, reproductive disorders, malnutrition, anxiety, vaginismus, and bacterial infections are just a FEW of the physical and psychological reasons why sustained disinterest in sex might be a problem. It's rarely ""I'm just not attracted to you anymore"" (and when that's the case, if sex is a requirement in your relationship, it's time to terminate that relationship).

And for people with libido high enough to cause them physical discomfort or adverse effects when their sexual desires aren't being met, I'd actually argue that a more equitable solution would be to speak to a doctor about that, too. A high enough sex drive that you NEED to have sex regularly on a physical level should be addressed medically, not by contractually violating another person's right to choose whether or not they have sex.",A,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B provides a more thorough and well-reasoned argument against the idea of sex as an obligation in a relationship. It highlights the importance of addressing the underlying reasons for loss of interest in sex, such as physical and psychological factors, rather than resorting to obligation-sex. Reply B also emphasizes the importance of respecting each partner's autonomy and right to choose whether or not to engage in sexual activity. Additionally, Reply B offers alternative solutions, such as seeking medical help for high libido or addressing potential health issues, which shows a more compassionate and understanding approach to the situation. Overall, Reply B presents a more nuanced and thoughtful perspective on the issue, which is likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially change their view."
predict-explain,"Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out.  
  
Vietnam was essentially a communist state, due to influences from China and USSR, which were alliances (the former is debatable) of Vietnam during the war. After the war, our country has suffered multiple economic depressions, and famines due to the incompetence of our liberally named Communist Party. Granted the South Vietnam government wasn't any better, but what the U.S wanted for Vietnam was for the best.  
  
I understand that, technically the US did not wage war with our people, but stood against the spread of communism in Asia, and with our strategic location, a battle surely followed. The US did not deliberately invaded our country. And look at what they did to the world. ~~Defeated the Nazis and fascist countries~~, uplifted South Korea, Japan (which were both smaller and less resourceful than my country) to their respectable position on the world map today. And what had the sole communist party in my country done? Nothing but left our people in the struggle of a third-world country. And China is still brazenly harassing our borders and seas to this very day, just because our army is incapable of standing up for themselves.  
  
~~Please tell me if I was wrong and why the North won was a good idea.~~  
  
Edit: My view has changed. It was not simple as I thought it was. Generally it can be summarized into those points: involvement of China, motives and war crimes committed by the US, and there was no hope in the governing system. Communism has not helped our people a bit, but no one can really advocates for America either. We as a nation should look to develop our own path. Insights are still very much appreciated. And thanks for the discussions.","I mean, I know a lot of Vietnamese-Americans who were refugees from South Vietnam who probably would have preferred the other side winning. So I don't think you're alone, but I think perhaps you're assuming that had the American backed South won, these problems would be fixed. I know you said the North was corrupt, but the South was every bit as corrupt. They probably wouldn't have been able to support the economy any better, and depressions and famine may have ensued anyway, albeit they may get support from the US. Remember that a significant number of Vietcong in the South were southerners who were disillusioned with the corruption of the government. So they in effect fueled quite a lot of backlash against themselves. I'd also point out that the government was rather unstable, as seen in the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem. If there was that much turnover, there could potentially be wars in the future over other rival factions or even communist resurgence or a probable and continual insurgency. So there's a significant potential that more Vietnamese would die in the coming years than the already horrible toll paid. Also, if the DRVN won the war, I highly doubt they'd be able to solve the border dispute between Vietnam and China considering those countries have been at odds for centuries if I'm not mistaken. My point here is that unfortunately the choice between a good government and a bad government appears to have been an illusion, and while unfortunately the current government isn't good, I guess you might say it's ""the devil you know"", considering things could have gone worse.","1) Do you know how brutal, corrupt, and undemocratic South Vietnam is? Ngô Đình Diệm isn't democratically elected, instead he was assumed the presidency by the American to a country largely make up by the remnant of French imperialism (a puppet state). He's also not popular either, remember Vietnam supposed to be unified in 1954 after Điện Biên Phủ, and supposed to hold democratic election in 1956 as a result of the Geneva Accord... Guess who would have won that if it is actually held? That's right, Hồ Chí Minh had the overwhelming support of the nation. Not because he is a communist/socialist figure, but rather a NATIONALIST one

Back to the period of Diem's rule, the government is largely consist of his family members holding key positions (gia dình tr). Also, there are huge oppression toward the Bhuddism commnunity, led to the self-immolation of some certain Bhuddist monk that you should know. Also, there were many wrongful incarceration/execution of people who are suspected to be Communists or spy from the North. Likewise, villagers are force to move into camps/fortresses to avert any uprising... These policies causing lots of oppositions from the people and thus Diem was murdered.. What happened after that was a two-year spans of political instability, and the country couldn't even control itself... Hence, the Americans forces had to involve, which coincide with Nguyen Van Thieu's rule (and he's merely a puppet in a gov't whose policies were largely dictated by the Americans)...

My point is that how could a government that unstable could actually controlled Vietnam. Lacking of integrity from the interior and strength to cope with outside forces... The result of the War largely reflects the nature of South Vietnam, a mere puppet state which shouldn't be there at first place 

2) You think that the American wanted the best for us? Well, do you understand the nature of the Cold War, a global-scale tension which Vietnam was reluctantly dragged into. Most Vietnamese couldn't associated their War within the Cold War concept, virtually because we're from the ""hottest"" spot, which overshadowed the Cold War itself. My point is the US had their own interest to stop the power of the USSR, thus they called ""spread of Communism"", and they went radical about it. Many democratic elected  socialist leaders were overthrow by the US army and replaced by anti-communism despot, most notably in [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) or [Guatemala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat). (Different circumstance but don't forget [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung-hee)). Vietnam War shared the same nature with these but much more intensify because of the [Domino Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory)

3) About OP &amp; Vietnam: ~~You're part of the bandwagon who want to gaze war with China to demand the islands back. How ignorance you are!~~ This is not XII century when you could easily declare war upon one another. If we do attack China, not will we suffer their reprimand, but will receive criticism around the world. Diplomacy is the key, stronger collaboration between ASEAN and the US forces would keep the Chinese in the current place. 

I can't believe you despise the Vietnamese gov't because of Communism. It's a fail economic model that Vietnam got rid of in 1986. The party retain the name for historical reason, and more importantly, its nature is NATIONALIST, and a political platform for all people. [One-party system is totally democratic if you keep different opinions among its memebers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOsjSKKPWMc). If you think multi-party platform could work in Vietnam, then consider what happen in South Vietnam during the war, and how they set up a dictatorship after. 

You should remember that Vietnam is war-free in 1989, so its economy has short time to recover and develop. Compare Vietnam economy to Korea's and Japan's one disregard circumstances is just compare apple to orange. Remember that the war would be completely averted in [1945](http://www.archives.gov/historical-docs/todays-doc/?dod-date=228) and [1954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conference_%281954%29).

predict-explain,"*[This article](https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/12/health-risk-having-gun-home) does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/defensive-gun-ownership-gary-kleck-response-115082.html#.Vdm1n_lVhBc) that lays out some criticisms of the first article's source study, along with a rebuttal from another journalist who's written on the topic.*

I believe that:

1. You, or someone in your family, are more likely to be killed by your gun either purposefully or accidentally than you are to use the gun against an attacker successfully in self-defense.

2. Therefore, if your goal is to make yourself and/or your family safer, then choosing to keep a gun in your home explicitly for that purpose is an irrational decision.


I do believe there is one exception to this. If you have a particular reason or belief that you are likely to be attacked, then, since the odds of being attacked have increased dramatically, then it may be rational to have a gun in the house for self-defense. For example, if you have a stalker. If you have received threats on your life. If you have any reasonable belief that someone will try to harm you specifically. If government or police forces have broken down. Basically, if the odds change so that for you the risk of you or your family being attacked is greater than the risk of having a gun in the house, then it would be rational to have a gun.

But we do know, statistically, on average, that is not the case. So for the average person, the risks are such that the rational decision for maximizing safety is to not keep a gun.

I further believe that if you get other uses out of the gun other than just self-defense, then the other added benefits of having a gun would make it rational to keep one in the house. For example, if somebody was a hunter and or target shooter and they get a lot of joy out of their hobby, that could be worth the risk of gun ownership. Or even if someone cited tradition, or the need of an armed populace as a check on the government, that too could be a perceived benefit to them that makes the safety risk worthwhile. I'm strictly speaking about what's the best decision for maximizing personal and family safety.

Change my view by showing me that the risk of harm to you or your family is lower by having a fire arm in the house.

This is a poor argument because the survey makes no attempt to differentiate between knowledgeable, responsible gun owners and people who don't pay attention to safety protocols or know how to properly use their gun. When accidental shootings or unnecessary violence happens it is because of ignorance and poor decision making, not because of the gun.

predict-explain,"I am American and have used toilet paper my whole life. I've had to use a bidet the past week for medical reasons, and I think that toilet paper is the far superior option.

**Cleanliness**

In this area, I prefer toilet paper for a few reasons. First of all, there is actual visual confirmation that you've got it all. With bidets you just have to keep spraying until you think you're good. And as the amount of wiping/bidet-ing can vary greatly, the visual aspect is a great help. (I used a towel to dab afterwards, as toilet paper doesn't hold up against all the water.)

Secondly, a bidet shouldn't be necessary as people (should) shower daily. Many people like to point out that bidets are better because they rinse away bacteria and other nastiness. But, a shower with actual soap and water and scrubbing should do that job much better than just water alone.

**""But you wouldn't just wipe it away if you got some on your hands!""**

No, and I don't think you'd just rinse it away either. You'd use soap and water and scrubbing. Another point, your hands are usually the first thing you use to touch something. Until you grab things with your bare ass, wiping is just as good.

**Comfort**

Good quality toilet paper is amazing. It's soft, thick, almost like Kleenex. Hell, you could wipe with Kleenex if you wanted. Point is that high quality stuff is glorious. On the other hand, you're getting a cold spray of water in a very sensitive area. Even if you have a super luxury bidet that uses heated water, it's still basically shooting water up your ass. Even low quality toilet paper is better than that. In a shower the water flows down, which is much less uncomfortable. With a bidet there's also the added trouble of being all drippy with water while you move to towel off. And unless you want to reach into the bowl with a towel while you're still sitting on it, you're going to have to at least move up to a squat to towel off. (Those with an air dryer feature may alleviate this somewhat, but toweling will probably still be necessary if the air hand dryers are anything to go by.)

**Price**

I understand bidets cost less. But for me and where I am in life, I can and will pay extra for quality. There must be many others who feel the same, or else only single ply sand paper toilet paper would exist. In this area bidets are better, but I think that if this is the reason someone buys a bidet it would be because they have to save money.

**Eco friendliness**

I think we're past the whole 'save the trees' business. Reforestation is greater than reforestation in most of the world. Bidets may actually do more harm in low water and drought areas, if everyone dropped toilet paper and got bidets the gallons would add up.

To clarify; I'm talking about a bidet for home use, that's built into the toilet. The bidets that are completely separate just seem impractical.

Edit: The point here is that given a choice between a bidet and toilet paper, toilet paper is better. In situations where there's no other alternatives, of course one will be used over the other.

So, CMV.

Bidet's just wash it right off.  Rarely have I ever been left questioning after bidet use; no matter how nasty my poops I feel pretty fresh after a bidet squirt.

True, but do you take a shower after every poop?  I doubt it.

Especially with the aforementioned never ending poop, you'll get a rashy ass in no time. Then you've got an itchy, smelly, dirty, poopy asshole you gotta put up with all day before you can get home and take a shower.

I find bidet's to be very comfortable. As do many others.  Since you've *NEVER* used one before, of course it's going to feel strange.  You've got what? Over 20 years of paper wiping familiarity? Of course it's going to feel strange.

Just let drip dry a bit; you'll be fine. Or if there is toilet paper also on hand, use some of that.

&gt; I think we're past the whole 'save the trees' business. Reforestation is greater than reforestation in most of the world. Bidets may actually do more harm in low water and drought areas, if everyone dropped toilet paper and got bidets the gallons would add up.

Doubtful.  The paper making process is very water intensive, not to mention the resource chain involved in getting that paper to the store so you can drive there to pick it up to take home to wipe your ass and throw away.","Toilet paper is fine if you have perfectly regular bowels, but if you have unfortunate variations such as a tendency towards compacted or loose stools, then bidets are better.

Bidets solve [Andy Dwyer's wiping problem,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGCIGEUB32M) which is more common than people like to talk about. Toilet paper only cleans the external surface. Bidets allow you to get inside the rectum a bit, which gives a more complete clean. There is no risk of anything being left over, which is not guaranteed with toilet paper. 

Sometimes toilet paper gets wet and breaks. If you have ass hair, sometimes the toilet paper get stuck in there. Water avoids this problem.

In humid environments, sometimes people get very sweaty bottoms. Swamp ass, is unpleasant and wiping doesn't really do much to relieve it. Bidets, with cool water, help alleviate the problem, at least temporarily. 

If you get the spray nozzle type of bidet, you can angle the water however you want. They attach to the wall and are pretty cheap to install. They are superior to both built in and entirely separate bidets. They are the most common type worldwide, and avoid many of the problems you mentioned.

predict-explain,"1. Squatting is more comfortable, easier and healthier than sitting. it creates less stress on the the puborectalis muscle allowing for a smoother uninterrupted experience. it plays well with gravity so less pressure is needed and lowers the risk of cancer and other ailments.

2. Toilet paper is messy, expensive and damages the environment. When washed properly the use of your hand is preferable to toilet paper, It might sound disgusting but when you think about it using a thin piece of frail paper to smear around fecal matter with no water or soap is even worse.

Also, cancer? Really? That sounds almost like a joke: ""I squat when I poop so I won't get cancer!""

2) Soap and other cleaning materials also have costs associated with them. The cleanliness bonus is marginal for people who shower daily. You'll need to use more water too to wash up. Are you sure that this is really a plus? 

3) They are also a great way to dispose of waste: it has to go somewhere, it can be toxic to plants, and toilets take up a negligibly larger amount of space than a bucket, which then requires 'maintenance' every time it needs emptied. Butts are also, with the exception of the asshole itself, [probably the cleanest part of our bodies.](http://health.thefuntimesguide.com/2006/08/dirtytoiletseat.php) They're always covered and we rarely directly touch anything with them; why would they be unclean?","1.) I will concede that on a biological level, squatting is the ""default"" position so our biology and anatomy generally works better in that position. 

2.) Toilet paper is a shield that, hopefully, keeps your hand and any small cuts, or splits cleaner and less prone to nasty infections. It does, as other commentators have said, keep feces out from underneath your fingernails. The associated costs of water usage, soap also affect the environment. (Though it must be noted that you still SHOULD wash your hands after pooing it just takes less if your not scrubbing last nights dinner off your hand.) 

3.) Bulky, dirty, and in need of maintenance I will give you. However, if we are talking about a toilet in a home cleanliness should be part of the necessary routine that would be needed if you had say, a bucket and a floor level toilet system. The complexity in a toilet provides a way to shield sewer gasses from coming back up into the restroom. It's not a perfect system but it's better than up against a tree in the woods.",B,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B acknowledges some of the points made by the original poster, such as the biological benefits of squatting and the environmental impact of using toilet paper. However, Reply B also brings up important counterpoints, such as the potential risks of using your hand instead of toilet paper and the necessity of modern toilets for hygiene and sanitation purposes. 

Overall, Reply B presents a more balanced and nuanced argument, addressing both the benefits and drawbacks of the original poster's claims. This approach is more likely to engage the original poster in a constructive discussion and potentially change their view."
predict-explain,"It is well known that the old testament refers to homosexuality as ""an abomination."" However, most christians do not believe in the applicability of Old Testament rules to the modern day due to the new covenant of Jesus Christ. Under this interpretation, homosexuality should be judged to be just as immoral as wearing mixed fabrics or eating pig, which to almost all Christians is ""not at all"". In fact, the notion that ""homosexuality is a sin"" is inconsistent with the theme of the New Testament, which Christians put much more emphasis on. In the New Testament, Jesus encourages believers not to judge the immorality of a person by what is socially acceptable, which is essentially what those who would say that homosexuality is a sin are doing.

*edit. So I have conceded that Homosexuality is a sin in the sense that all sexuality is a sin through lust. BUT that's not the crux of the argument about homosexuality. The question is whether homosexuality is 'especially' sinful.

Certainly nearly everything *sexual* is a sin.  The only exception would be intercourse for the purpose of pro-creation.

So looking at a woman with lustful thoughts is a sin.  Looking at pornography is a sin. Masturbation is a sin.  And, certainly, man-on-man anal sex is a sin.

So the only way that homosexuality *wouldn't* be a sin is if it were never an influence in one's life.  That mean, a dude can't even *think about* how good some cowboy's ass looks in his chaps.  And if you never even get to the point of thinking about stuff like that, how do you define it as homosexuality in the first place?  Homosexuality *is* the lusting after members of the same gender.

So while I would be more inclined to agree that homosexuality is no more or less of a sin than non-reproductive-oriented heterosexuality, I don't see how you could claim that homosexuality isn't a sin at all.","Well, yea.

There is a large and growing number of Christians, including religious leaders, theologians, historians, and whole denominations, who don't think a universal and eternal condemnation of all same gender relationships is an accurate understanding or appropriate application of scripture.

The Episcopal church is not a small or marginalized denomination, and the church General Convention recently voted with an 85% majority to [**extend the sacrament of marriage to same gender couples**](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/07/01/why-the-episcopal-church-is-still-debating-gay-marriage/). And they are [**far from alone**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT-affirming_Christian_denominations).

Also, why would you think that all sexuality is a sin? It's not a sin to sexually desire your own spouse.

It's worth noting that Reconstructionist, Reform, and most branches of Conservative Judaism do not think same gender relationships are inherently sinful either. Even the famous Levitical passages aren't a blanket condemnation of same gender relationships. Among other things, they don't say anything about relationships between women at all. They exclusively address sex between men, and only under the specific conditions in which one man is being treated *""as if he were a woman.""*

There are a lot of different ideas on what exactly that meant when it was written. Conservative Judaism tends to understand it as condemning penetrative sex between men, without condemning other forms of sex or relationship between men. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism, and many branches of Christianity, tend to see these passages as forbidding men from using sex as a form of ownership over other men, with implications of sexual slavery.

In both cases, these are culturally and historically specific texts referring not to gay people in general, but to the execution of people believed at the time to either be endangering the foundations of the universe, or people engaged in sexual slavery and rape.",A,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a more nuanced and inclusive perspective on the interpretation of scripture regarding homosexuality. It highlights the diversity of beliefs within Christianity and Judaism, showing that not all religious traditions view same-gender relationships as inherently sinful. Additionally, reply B offers a historical and cultural context for the biblical passages often cited in discussions about homosexuality, suggesting that they may not be as clear-cut as some interpretations make them out to be. Overall, reply B presents a more open-minded and informed perspective on the topic, which could potentially challenge the original poster's views on homosexuality and its relationship to religious beliefs."
predict-explain,"For context: I am in the UK, so that is the political system I'm most familiar with. I am also NOT very knowledgeable about politics in general, but I have enough of an idea to know what opinions I do and don't agree with.

Left-wing views seem to pretty much say that everyone should look after each other. Everyone should do what they are able to and share their skills and resources. That means people who are able to do a lot will support those who can't (e.g. those who are ill, elderly, disabled). The result is that everyone is able to survive happily/healthily and with equal resources from sharing.

Right-wing views seem to pretty much say that everyone is in it for themself. Everyone should be 'allowed' to get rich by exploiting others, because everyone has the same opportunities to do that. People that are successful in exploiting others/getting rich/etc are just those who have worked the hardest. It then follows that people who are unable to do those things - for example, because they are ill or disabled - should not be helped. Instead, they should ""just try harder"" or ""just get better"", or at worst ""just die and remove themselves from the gene pool"".

When right-wing people are worried about left-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be allowed to make as much money, or that their money will be taken away. They're basically worried that they won't be able to be better off than everyone else. When left-wing people are worried about right-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be able to survive without others helping and sharing. They are basically worried for their lives. It seems pretty obvious to conclude that right-wing politics are more selfish and dangerous than left-wing politics, based on what people are worried about.

How can right-wing politics be reconciled with supporting and caring for ill and disabled people? How do right-wing people justify their politics when they literally cause some people to fear for their lives? Are right-wing politics inherently selfish?

Please, change my view!

Edit: I want to clarify a bit here. I'm not saying that right-wing *people* or *politicians* are necessarily selfish. Arguing that *all* politicians are selfish in the same way does not change my view (I already agree with that). I'm talking more about right- or left-wing *ideas* and their theoretical logical conclusions. Imagine a 'pure' (though not necessarily authoritarian) right-wing person who was able to perfectly construct the society they thought was ideal - *that's* the kind of thing I want to understand.

Edit 2: There are now officially too many comments for me to read all of them. I'll still read anything that's a top-level reply or a reply to a comment I made, but I'm no longer able to keep track of all the other threads! If you want to make sure I notice something you write that's not a direct reply, tag me in it.

Edit 3: I've sort of lost track of the particular posts that helped because I've been trying to read everything. But here is a summary of what I have learned/what views have changed:

* Moral views are distinct from political views - a person's opinion about the role of the government is nothing to do with their opinion about whether people should be cared for or be equal. Most people are basically selfish anyway, but most people also want to do what is right for everyone in their own opinion.

* Right-wing people (largely) do not actually think that people who can't care for themselves shouldn't be helped. They just believe that private organisations (rather than the government) should be responsible for providing that help. They may be of the opinion that private organisations are more efficient, cheaper, fairer, or better at it than the government in various ways.

* Right-wing people believe that individuals should have the choice to use their money to help others (by giving to charitable organisations), rather than be forced into it by the government. They would prefer to voluntarily donate lots of money to charity, than to have money taken in the form of taxes which is then used for the same purposes.

Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","There are a lot of complicated and charged issues that you have bundled together. However, i think its necessary to clarify your conclusion:
&gt;It seems pretty obvious to conclude that right-wing politics are more selfish and dangerous than left-wing politics, based on what people are worried about.

I don't think its accurate to say that one political view is more or less selfish than the other. Politicians by nature must appeal to their demographic, every policy they espouse is inherently selfish in that they are designed to garner public support. A right wing politician supporting tax cuts is no different from a left wing politician looking to heighten benefit payouts. Each policy is equally selfish in its intention, the point of contention is which policy might give greater net-positive impact upon society as a whole. These are complicated matters where economics and social justice desires intersect. 

Another point i want to address is a right wing politician being ""more dangerous"" than a left wing politician. I think its fairly safe to dismiss this notion entirely. Firstly, the two party system which originated from the UK acts as a check on power. One is not inherently more dangerous than the other. More importantly, the principles of representative and responsible government ensures that politicians under the Westminster system can't enact dangerous policies without the implied consent of the people.

Hence, politician's on either side are not inherently more or less selfish than their counterparts.","Both sides are more obsessed with adhering to their identity than they are with helping either themselves or others. If leftists really cared about global warming and feeding hungry people, they wouldn't be so against nuclear power and GMOs. If rightists were actually concerned with personal freedoms, they would acknowledge that you can't have a lot of freedom without at least some redistribution.

Unless you are a politician yourself, it's really not all that helpful to think about this stuff in terms of right and left. Sometimes rightists are correct, sometimes leftists. Try not to become attached to a certain political identity, because it will make you more wrong. Your environment seems more left (since your view basically describes them as the good guys), so you should probably think more critically about leftist opinions.

&gt; When right-wing people are worried about left-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be allowed to make as much money, or that their money will be taken away. They're basically worried that they won't be able to be better off than everyone else

Not really. Right-wing people tend to be more concerned with free markets than those on the left, but there's a good reason for that. In the world we live in, the free market is what brings prosperity. Regulating an industry could decrease the money a country makes and thus also the taxes they bring in. From a right-wing view, the best way to get more funding for whatever (say, helping the disabled) is to make sure companies make more money, because then they'll have to pay more taxes. 

&gt; When left-wing people are worried about right-wing politicians being in charge, they are worried that they won't be able to survive without others helping and sharing. They are basically worried for their lives.

This is very much not the case. For the most part, left-winged politicians do **not** need to fear for their lives. They're roughly as well-off as right-winged politicians. And if you really think that left-winged people genuinely believe *they* wouldn't be able to survive, that's about as selfish as you can get: forcing people to help you so *you* can survive. 


I don't think the left-right dichotomy breaks down at ""selfish"" vs ""selfless."" It's a lot more complex than that, especially since there are so many people tying their identity to either side of this dichotomy. Look, for example, at how the right stands both for reducing government spending but also for increasing police funding and building more prisons. Those are both right-wing beliefs, but they don't really mix very well.

&gt; How can right-wing politics be reconciled with supporting and caring for ill and disabled people?

Most of right-wing politics does not support just leaving the ill and disabled out to die. (The most extreme stuff, like fascism, does, but hardly anyone sane supports that.) Right-wing politics rather believes that people know most about their own lives and will ultimately make the best decisions about how to live it. This includes how people allocate their resources (e.g. money and time). And they don't believe that people are basically selfish, because they honestly think that if you reduce taxes, people will give more to charity. Combine this increased funding for charity with an efficient free-market and you end up (in theory) with affordable healthcare for everyone. 

&gt; How do right-wing people justify their politics when they literally cause some people to fear for their lives?

Do you genuinely believe that left-wing politics has never made anyone fear for their lives? The left's refusal to consider nuclear energy has probably killed a lot of people, because it led to more CO2 being pumped in the atmosphere. Somewhere in the world, people have been denied good medical treatment because the bureaucracy surrounding it went terrible (For example, the best treatment for my ADHD is something I can't afford because of the red tape surrounding getting your drug approved for government help in paying for it.)

If you're going to make statements such as ""right-wing politics literally cause people to fear for their lives,"" you're going to have to qualify what part of right-wing politics you are talking about, because there are plenty of right-wing policies that don't do that and a decent amount that makes people's lives better than their oppositional left-wing policies.

&gt; Are right-wing politics inherently selfish?

Sometimes, but not most of the time.",B,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a more nuanced and balanced perspective on the issue, highlighting that both left and right-wing politicians can be equally selfish in their policies, and that the concern about one side being more dangerous than the other is unfounded. The reply also emphasizes the complexity of political ideologies and the need to evaluate policies based on their impact on society as a whole. 

On the other hand, Reply B takes a more critical approach towards both left and right-wing ideologies, but it also makes sweeping generalizations and assumptions about the motivations and beliefs of individuals within those ideologies. It also presents a more polarized view of the political spectrum, which may not be as effective in changing the original poster's view. 

Overall, Reply A provides a more balanced and reasoned argument that is more likely to challenge the original poster's perspective and encourage them to reconsider their views on left and right-wing politics."
predict-explain,"Personally, I'm not religious, so I guess I'm trying to get some insight here. Here's the deal, say you live in a world where it is impossible to do anything morally wrong. Then in that world there would be no reason to praise or reward someone for doing the moral thing because there is no other option. Likewise, there is no one who could possibly be punished (like sending them to hell for instance). Clearly we do not live in such a world, but religious individuals/groups who insist that something should be illegal or made nearly impossible due to religious views are trying to make our world more like the one in the scenario I suggested above where it is impossible to do anything morally wrong. Thus, forcing people to comply with the rules of your religion actually seem to make the rules less meaningful which seems like something that religious individuals would want to avoid.

Note, I'm only talking about things where the main reason for believing them is religion - like beliefs about gay marriage, premarital sex, drinking alcohol, etc. Therefore, things like the belief that you should not murder people would not count as having a primarily religious nature because most people also find murder horrific in a separate sense from religion.

To phrase it differently, if all alcohol disappeared from earth tomorrow and humans somehow could no longer make it, would abstaining from drinking alcohol mean anything? I don't think so.

Without having the choice to do the 'wrong' thing, then doing the 'right' thing is meaningless.

Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","Seems to me that your position is built on the assumption that the religious view is factually incorrect, no? That seems to be the key issue here.

Let's say, for example, that I have a religious belief that if you have gay sex, it will cause a drought. And therefore I think we should ban gay sex.

What's really the important issue here. That my position is motivated by religion? Or that my position was factually inaccurate? To me, as an atheist, I actually don't care what the motivation for your belief is, whether it be religious or secular. I care about 2 things, in a very very simplified model:

1) Do I agree with the goal you are trying to achieve?

2) If so, do I agree that the means you advocate achieves that goal?

Taking the example above, I do agree that drought is bad. So we've passed step 1. But I don't agree that banning gay sex will alleviate the drought. Whether or not your belief that doing so comes from religious or secular just doesn't seem relevant.

Make sense?","I am not entirely sure what view you are attempting to have changed here. Either ""my religion states that drinking is wrong so for that reason I am fighting to make alcohol illegal"" is what you take issue with, or ""my religion states drinking is wrong, and it is more virtuous to abstain from drinking when temptation is all around you than to abstain when abstinence has been made the default legal option"".

The first one which is often tied to another topic which I don't want to start a debate about, could be construed in a few different ways. If drinking is such a reprehensible act and the ills it causes society are immeasurably horrific according to your religion, then doing everything in your power to prevent it from happening (in this case enacting legislation) could be considered moral and desirable. Further, if there are people who do not subscribe to your religion that take part in such a sinful exercise, while you may not be converting them to your religion (which is often the ultimate goal) you are at least preventing them from doing something that you view as wrong. 

Let's say we did live in a world where murder really was perfectly acceptable, but religion decided it isn't as great as everyone else thinks it is. If religion cannot convert everyone to that religion and their beliefs, would it not be at least a partial win for them to use ""secular"" powers for them to prevent murder? Would it not be dutiful/righteous of you and your religion to try to prevent everyone else from doing things you believe to be wrong?

For the second ""without temptation, abstinence is meaningless"" argument, people who have a religious conviction to avoid something typically put a great deal of effort into avoiding situations where they would encounter temptation. While alcohol may be freely available in some parts of the world, most people who have made a religious decision to avoid it do not keep it in the house to test their temptation. In largely religious communities/jurisdictions, it might not be commercially available, or at least you have to go out of your way to find it. They probably don't find themselves at craft beer festivals, taking winery tours, going to dollar pint night etc. all that frequently either. So while they might not be fighting for prohibition to be reenacted, they aren't actively seeking out alcohol in order to not drink it, and I doubt it would be considered good or righteous for them to be doing so. 

Are you suggesting that ""true believers"" would/should be testing their beliefs by regularly encountering temptation? Is that the best way to prove your faith?

Personally, I believe that if someone has a religious conviction against something then they are welcomed to believe that, but they should be accepting that others do not share their faith and thus their beliefs. That concept runs completely against most religions, as they tend to have some sort of ""share the good word"" or ""make others believe"" clause in there somewhere, but whether or not religion is a good or bad thing is not the topic of this CMV.",A,A,"I would say that reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because reply A focuses on the core issue of whether the goal being pursued is valid, regardless of the motivation behind it (religious or secular). It breaks down the argument into two simple questions - whether the goal is agreed upon and whether the means advocated actually achieve that goal. This approach is logical and rational, which may appeal more to someone who is not religious and is questioning the validity of religiously motivated beliefs.

On the other hand, reply B delves more into the intricacies of religious convictions and how they are practiced in daily life. While it provides some interesting insights, it may not directly address the original poster's concerns about the meaningfulness of moral actions in a world where there is no choice to do wrong. Additionally, it raises questions about the testing of faith through temptation, which may not directly address the original argument presented by the poster."
predict-explain,"There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives  and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, others claim that increased government spending (while keeping taxation the same) simulates the economy, but there is no consensus on this point, among economists or politicians. Deficit spending stimulates the economy, but we are already deficit spending, and the national debt is already rather large, so we can't do that forever. Low interest rates stimulate the economy, but elected officials have no direct influence over interest rates -- the Federal Reserve Board does that, and interest rates are already very, very low. New export markets also help, but the U.S. is already committed to several ambitious international trade agreements. Investor confidence helps, a little, maybe, sometimes, but the U.S. stock market is already overpriced. Beyond that, most economic growth comes from increases in productivity, and consumer confidence. Elected officials have no control over these.

If you vote for a candidate who promises to ""create jobs"" or ""grow the economy,"" you're either voting for a liar or a fool. Change my view!

Edit: I'm speaking of the U.S. economy, not the global economy, and I'm speaking of political candidates who might run for office in the near future, not the distant future or the past.

If you're elected Prime Minister of a very poor country, there are probably quite a lot of policy levers you can pull to massively improve your economy.  Deng Xiaoping made policy changes (a massive liberalization and reversal of Mao-era collectivism) that massively improved the economy of China.

Now, the US is much closer to the frontier of what's possible than China was in the 1970s, so there may not be as many gains to be had.  However, there is a potential policy out there that's big enough to make a sea change: open borders.

[This paper](http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.25.3.83) makes a pretty persuasive case that opening the borders of western countries to all migrants would **double world GDP.**  That's huge economic growth.  If a candidate says they're going to massively improve the US economy, and open borders are in their platform, they're not necessarily full of shit.","In 1999, Bill Clinton and the Congress repealed the Glass-Steagall Act. This may have not caused the 2008 Global Financial Crisis all on its own, but it made sure that *everybody* got hurt because it allowed banks to combine personal savings and risky investments. 

Because of the repeal of the GSA, the 2008 crash cost up to [$14 trillion](http://www.dallasfed.org/research/eclett/2013/el1307.cfm).",B,B,"I believe Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides a specific example of policy changes that have had a significant impact on the economy, such as Deng Xiaoping's reforms in China. It also introduces the idea of open borders as a potential policy lever that could have a major impact on economic growth. This contrasts with the original poster's assertion that politicians have limited ability to influence the economy.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses on the negative consequences of a specific policy change (the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act) without necessarily offering a clear alternative or solution. While it highlights the potential harm caused by certain policy decisions, it may not be as effective in changing the original poster's view about the ability of politicians to impact the economy."
predict-explain,"So the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to argue otherwise (for some animals it is very easy to read their emotional state), but I won't argue that because I think the whole idea that consent would be necessary in these situations is completely inconsistent with how animals are treated by the vast majority of our population, including vegetarians.

Example 1(for the vegetarians, but applicable for everyone): Pet ownership. Do we get consent when we take a puppy from his parents? Do we get consent when we neuter them? If you assume that consent is essential in animal/human relationships, pet ownership itself becomes a kind of slavery or imprisonment. The owner provides food and housing, the pet is imprisoned and provides entertainment to the owner. Any argument you could run about this being justifiable without consent would frighteningly similar to arguments for why slavery in the U.S. was good for many of the slaves. Arguments that they ""seem happy,"" or ""they don't run away"" are meaningless when you have kidnapped an animal and brought it up to be dependent on you. I'm not saying pet ownership IS slavery; I'm saying that the only way it pet ownership can be justified is if you toss out the idea of needing consent for our interactions with animals.

Example 2(for the carnivores): The vast majority of human beings eat animals. If you are one of this majority, the idea that you would ask an animals consent for anything is laughable. You could argue that unnecessary cruelty is still wrong, but much beastiality clearly involves the pleasuring of the animal, not the torturing of it. And regardless, arguments against cruelty have nothing to do with ""consent.""

So that's my basic argument. Come on reddit, change my view!

Edit: Changed zoophillia to beastility since zoophillia does not necessarily involve actual sex with animals. 

Edit 2: Just to clarify, I think bestiality is both disgusting and morally wrong. I think that cruelty to animals is wrong. This CMV is not ""convince me that bestiality is wrong"" or ""convince me that bestiality hurts animals""; it is ""convince me that consent is a relevant concept when applied to animals.""

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","You are saying:

1. We don't require an animal's consent for being kept as a pet, nor for eating it or consuming its milk, so consent is not relevant to human-animal interactions;
2. Sex is just another human-animal interaction;
3. Hence consent is also not relevant to humans having sex with animals, aka bestiality.

Clearly (1) is true, and (3) is a simple logical inference. But the weak point in your argument is (2), i.e., your assumption that there isn't anything special about sex.

In actuality, there are some things that are special about sex, in particular in regards to consent. We are ok with an adult playing basketball with a consenting minor, or forcing a minor to go to school even without consent, but we are not ok with an adult having sex with a minor in any situation. In other words, there are things adults can do with children that do not require their consent (forcing them to go to school) and there are things we do not consider children to be able to consent to in any situation (sex), even though the majority of adult-child interactions are guided by consent (playing basketball).

The argument could then be made, that animals are a parallel to children. Animals can be forced to do some things without their consent, like keeping them as pets or eating them for food, which would parallel adults forcing children to go to school. We don't require consent in those areas. And there are some things that we just do not consider animals to be able to consent to, and are therefore forbidden, namely sex, which would be a direct parallel to sex with children.

Now, you make a fair point that there might be a form of inconsistency here - why is it ok to ignore consent in some areas, and not in sex? However, the same potential inconsistency exists in society's treatment of children, and not just in society's treatment of animals, so if there is an inconsistency (debatable) it is at least one which society applies in a consistent way between animals and children.","&gt;  I'm saying that the only way it pet ownership can be justified is if you toss out the idea of needing consent for our interactions with animals.

You're taking a lot of liberties where society does not.  We do throw out the concept of consent for ownership, but not for *everything*.  In fact it's fairly common for one person to break into another person's car if a pet is locked in without ventilation.  People are willing to put their rights and safety at risk and to damage another person's property.  There are comparable with excessively disciplining animals.  Society at large doesn't just think that an owner can do as they please with their pets.

&gt;  The vast majority of human beings eat animals.

Here you are merging the concept of animals as pets and animals as food.  While in many cases the animal is the same, the relationship is starkly different.  It would be like saying that humans are ok with other humans being beaten nearly to death because we all know that it happens in torture scenarios.  There are corner case scenarios which allow for a set of behaviors but that does not mean that they can be extended to everything.  Humans make what we feel are necessary concessions in the treatment of animals because we ultimately need them to become our food.  This does not mean that we approve of everything that happens so much as we may not be able to stop it.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a logical argument comparing the concept of consent in human-animal interactions to the concept of consent in adult-child interactions. By drawing this parallel, Reply A highlights the inconsistency in society's treatment of animals in regards to consent, specifically in the case of bestiality. This argument challenges the original poster's assertion that consent is not relevant in human-animal interactions, particularly when it comes to sexual interactions.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on pointing out the flaws in the original poster's examples and arguments, rather than providing a strong counterargument. While Reply B does bring up valid points about society's treatment of animals in different contexts (as pets vs. food), it doesn't directly address the issue of consent in bestiality and how it relates to other forms of human-animal interactions.

Overall, Reply A presents a more compelling argument that challenges the original poster's viewpoint and provides a logical framework for considering the importance of consent in human-animal interactions."

Similar reasons as to why cigarette companies aren't fond of the Surgeon General's warning to remind people of potential negative health risks. Yes, customers know the health risks to smoking, and are able to make their own informed decisions, but the label nonetheless has a deterring quality that can drive away sales.

The same would likely go for any food product with such a label. Mark their products as having GMOs, and those who are opposed to them will drop their sales of those products. Thus, companies at risk of getting that label wouldn't want that drop in sales.

Regardless of whether or not GMOs have significant harms - socio-politically, legally, or biologically - as long as there is significant public disapproval of them, companies would rather not be forced to bear a label that will deter sales. It's not a matter of whether or not they have ""something to hide"".","So what do you mean by safety?  To consume?  This is really easy to determine.  The chemicals which constitute food plants are really well known and we can test a plant for anything we want.  So if you want to know if a food is safe to eat, send it to some chemists, and they'll tell you if it has any dangerous concentrations of chemicals.

You don't need to do a complex wait and see approach to it.  You just use [mass spectrometry.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry)  There are other tests too, spectrometry is just the best at catching even traces.

As far as labeling, they fight it because people would buy less if they saw the label.",B,B,"I believe reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a comparison to the tobacco industry and the Surgeon General's warning, illustrating how labeling can have a deterring effect on sales regardless of the actual safety of the product. This analogy helps to address the original poster's suspicion about why companies would fight against labeling GMOs without necessarily having something to hide. Reply A also acknowledges the public disapproval of GMOs and the impact it has on sales, which adds a layer of complexity to the issue. On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the safety of consuming GMOs, which may not directly address the original poster's concerns about labeling and corporate practices."
predict-explain,"So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But I think that if we were to put a place a law mandating employers to give paid maternity leave, it would result in unfair hiring biases against women. Some employers would develop a preference for hiring men over women because, if you are purely concerned with profit as lots of employers are, why take the risk of hiring a lady who might take a lot of time from work while you can just not risk it and hire a man? There are already a lot of stereotypes about women being less dedicated to their jobs than men because they are ""more focused on kids"". Wouldn't a mandatory maternity leave just make this worse? 

It's particularly unfair to women who aren't planning on having kids because employers could be biased against them for expecting them to use something they won't ever even need in the first place!

If paternity leave were also mandated, then this would be less of a problem because men would be as likely (or nearly as likely) to take leave as well, making the ""expected value"" of a man's labor to an employer the same as a woman's, and hopefully eliminating the bias.

1.  As /u/Madplato mentioned, employers are often already biased against hiring women because of the perception that they will probably get pregnant at some point and take off from work.  I don't think requiring employers to pay for the maternity leave would much affect this perception, because I doubt employers will seriously think women who otherwise wouldn't have gotten pregnant and taken time off anyway will now decide to do so just for a few months' pay.  This negative perception of women already unfairly affects women who don't intend to have children.

2.  Employers often already have a perception that men will be more dedicated workers, whether or not you have paid maternity leave, or paid leave for both parents; there's an expectation that men will take less time off for any family-related reason than women.  So I think even if a law requiring paid maternity leave did harm women, adding paid paternity leave wouldn't fix that, because the underlying assumptions about men and women wouldn't change.

Finally, I would say that even taking into account a small chance that employers will discriminate against women more if required to pay for maternity leave, it would still do more good than harm to women workers on the whole.  Not being able to take any time off work to recover from pregnancy and spend quality time with your baby can be a huge source of pressure for women, and can force women to put off having children until later than they would want.  All of these factors harm women.","Firstly, I think what you're describing is already happening, simply because women do get pregnant and, mandatory leave or not, will take time off work at some point because of it. There's not much way around it. In the event where the government pays most of the salary while on leave, I don't think hiring practice would change much. 

Secondly, I agree that paid paternity leave should also be an option in the event of a mandatory paid maternity leave, if only for the sake of equality. However, I don't think this will change the current hiring practices, simply because I believe males will be less likely to take these leaves than women.",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a more in-depth analysis of the issue at hand, addressing the existing biases against women in the workforce and how they may not necessarily be exacerbated by mandated paid maternity leave. The argument is well-reasoned and acknowledges the potential concerns raised by the original poster, while also highlighting the benefits that paid maternity leave can bring to women in the workforce. 

On the other hand, Reply B's argument is more simplistic and does not delve as deeply into the complexities of the issue. While it does agree that paid paternity leave should also be an option for equality's sake, it does not provide as strong of a counterargument to the original poster's concerns about potential biases against women in hiring practices. 

Overall, Reply A's thorough analysis and consideration of various factors make it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"When police introduce a new form of speed prevention through easier distribution of tickets or they crack down on speeders, the motivation behind it doesn't actually make a difference. Whether they are doing it to decrease chances of accidents or they are revenue raising, the power still lies completely in the hand of the person behind the wheel.

Even if the police had the intention of revenue raising, that money still goes toward hiring more officers, putting more police cars on the road and getting better technology to combat road accidents. They aren't making anyone speed, they are just making the best of the fact that people are going to speed, so they might as well bring some revenue in from it.

Edit: I should have clarified that I am referring exclusively to traffic offences eg. Speeding, drink driving etc.

Edit: My view has been changed.

I now see that the motivations behind revenue raising contradict the motivations that the police service is created to have. If revenue raising was the goal, the Police service would not only be out for the wrong reasons, but the entire outcome of what they would achieve would be counterproductive to society as a whole. Due to this, revenue raising cannot be seen as morally sound.","Police often go after out of town drivers because they can make more money off of them (for various reasons). If a cop is ordered to bust out of town plates before in-town plates, it is reasonable to assume that he will pull over a foreigner going 67 before a resident going 70 (in a 60 speed limit) right next to each other. What if the driver going 70 kills someone right after? Would you hold the police force responsible for this? Technically they pulled over a safer driver for an opportunity to make more money. 

Think about how much this kind of behavior could hurt society: In business we call optimizing our resources to make the most money in certain areas *targeting*. This is a kind of discrimination, but because businesses do not have a moral or legal obligation to market their services to the whole population, there is nothing wrong with it. However, police forces are expected to offer their services to the whole population without discrimination, economic included. Bottom line: The two target areas of enforcement ""make society safest"" and ""make the most money for police force"" are not identical. So which area would you rather be enforced by your police?","Conflict of interest. The purpose of the police, in almost every area, is to protect and serve, not to protect, serve, and raise money. If police are getting more money from giving tickets to speeders than doing other duties, such as monitoring for phone usage in school zones or providing a presence in a neighborhood as a deterrent or pursuing other, more dangerous offenders, that's a problem.

I, personally, would much prefer my local police force to prioritize danger, and not have to worry that they'll be busy doing the easy jobs or the cash-grabbing jobs when they should be protecting and serving. I don't want my local police worrying about anything that isn't keeping the public safe and being fair in that enforcement.

And then there's the issue of discrimination. Will cops see a shitty, cheap car speeding and ignore it because they think the driver can't pay up, but pursue all the luxury cars and give them every conceivable charge in the interest of milking them? I mean, I'm less offended by the idea of discriminating against rich people than most other groups, but, again, if the cops are going after the money instead of the danger, I think that's a big problem for my safety as a citizen.",A,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B highlights the conflict of interest that arises when police prioritize revenue raising over their duty to protect and serve. The reply also brings up the issue of discrimination and how focusing on making money from tickets can lead to unfair targeting of certain groups. Overall, Reply B presents a strong argument against the original poster's viewpoint and raises important ethical concerns about the motivations behind revenue raising through traffic enforcement."
predict-explain,"I hate driving. One of the main reasons is (aside from being kind of a shitty driver myself), I feel like turning your head 135 degrees to check your blind spot is extremely dangerous, even though it's part of the standard procedure for changing into another lane. This is especially bad now that I've got a [Madza 3](http://images.newcars.com/images/car-pictures/original/2014-Mazda-Mazda3-Sedan-i-SV-4dr-Sedan-Photo-3.png), since the backseat windows are so high up that I have to crane my neck and can barely make out what's going on in my blind spot anyways. Also, having to turn my head to such a wide angle means there's a lot more time when my eyes aren't in front of me, on the road ahead.

I understand that it's absolutely essential to make sure there's nobody in your blind spot. But there's lots of solutions that allow you to use mirrors to check instead, among them being

- [adjusting your sideviews to incorporate the blind spot](http://www.caranddriver.com/features/how-to-adjust-your-mirrors-to-avoid-blind-spots)
- [buying one of these](http://www.amazon.com/Fit-System-C0400-Passenger-Adjustable/dp/B001DKT0DO/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436313257&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=blind+spot+mirror)

Both of these options let you keep at least your peripheral vision on the road and greatly reduces the time it takes you check your blind spot.

Edit: Apparently, I've been doing it wrong the whole time. You guys are right, there shouldn't be any reason to take 2 seconds to do a shoulder check - I tend to scan the whole rear side of my car instead of looking at a specific spot. Thanks for the responses, I'm gonna go on youtube now and figure out how to drive more properly","You seem to be making checking the blind spot way harder on yourself than it has to be. It should be 1/4 second, turning your head at best 70 degrees and then glancing your eyes to the side. Most of the time, you know what's going on in your blind spot. The only time there should be any confusion is where bikers are allowed because they don't make noise, but typically you know if you have someone besides you on the highway. I'd suggest that you utilize slowing down and speeding up to accomplish what you want if you hate checking your blind spot so much or are scared that you sideswipe the car besides you either way. If you don't have a car directly in front of you, you can speed up 10-15 MPH (on a highway) and give yourself a comfortable lead so the car in you desired lane can see your turn signal and slow down for you. If you do have a car directly in front of you, you can plan ahead by putting your turn signal on immediately (so cars behind you can expect your next move) and then slow down at a constant rate of 10 or so MPH (again using highway speeds), let the car in your desired lane pass and then change lanes.","I think you might be doing the blind spot check wrong. You aren't supposed to scan the whole area. There is one specific spot, maybe 6 inches in diameter on each side that you are supposed to look at. It's a very fast process. 

The best way I can describe it is by relating it to video games. I don't know if you've ever played Counter-Strike, but there was a type of cheat called an aimbot. Whereas regular players would jump through a door and look around for players before starting to shoot, the aimbot already knew where the players were and automatically aimed the gun right at the other player's head. That's how you want your blind spot check to look. You look right at that one spot quickly and then go back to the road. You can take your time with it since you aren't wasting looks at places that are covered by your mirror.

Proper shoulder checks are irreplaceable. There is a very large blind spot in all cars, and many many accidents are caused by people not doing a proper shoulder check. My driver's ed instructor even made it a point that if we ever look at a mirror, we can't just move our eyes. We had to move our entire heads. It seemed stupid at the time, but I'm a much safer driver today because I made it a habit.",B,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a clear and specific explanation of how to properly check the blind spot, using a relatable analogy to help the original poster understand the concept better. Additionally, the mention of the driver's ed instructor emphasizing the importance of proper shoulder checks adds credibility to the argument. Reply A, on the other hand, suggests alternative methods to avoid checking the blind spot, which may not address the root issue of the original poster's discomfort with the standard procedure. Overall, reply B provides a more thorough and convincing argument for the importance of proper blind spot checks."
predict-explain,"So I've always kind of thought that it was ridiculous that my hometowns line of defense against fires was a bunch of volunteers. I know that they do receive training but knowing some of them personally they really take it all as some joke- not saying that all volunteers do -but I think that if your going to be in charge of saving someones life and are going to risk your own life you should be a paid professional.

Other than the argument that paying firefighters is too expensive for the state why the heck else do all these small towns rely on locals to just figure it out themselves.

**Please see thndrchld and Mine's conversation below**

&gt;And as far a what I said by taking it as a joke I know a kid that joined because he wanted to shack-up in a fire engine, An ex of mine's grandfather was the long running lead volunteer fighter and often joke that if a N****'s house caught fire he'd let them burn- these are the things that went on in my small home town.
&gt;And that is one of the main reason that i feel this should be handled by professionals, not just and guy off the street with his own agenda.- so one more question- if you were volunteering with either of the guys I mentioned what would you do? and how could you have those people removed?

**celeritas365 made a good point**

&gt;What about mixed? In my town we have some professionals and some volunteers. Some of the volunteers are more for support and can't go into a burning building. The stuff that happens outside is still important. Why pay a full firefighter when you don't need all of his or her skills? Also, much of what fire departments do is checking for fires when a house alarm goes off and doing small yet important things like chemically treating gasoline spills from auto accidents so they don't catch fire. While important, I don't see why a team of ALL professional firefighters need to do these tasks.

I think maybe thats what i mean more- There should be professionals at all depts, no ALL volunteer depts should exist.- that also solves the money issue with for example 1 pro for every 5 volunteers.

**Ada1629 Also had a good point on my thoughts**
&gt;However, I feel uncomfortable with people working for free - it becomes suspect to me that something more nefarious is going on 
&gt;I also question how stringent the rules are when there is nothing on the line but free labor for those doing the ""hiring""?

We work very closely with the local fire departments, as well as the local EMS provider.

I assure you, there's no lack for training, regulation, or sobriety in what we do.  

Last year, we ran over 2,200 calls ranging from ""Ow, I stubbed my toe"" to ""Oh God Oh God, there's blood everywhere!""

We provide supplemental EMS to the county, as well as first-responder emergency care for outlying rural areas that might not get an ambulance very quickly.  We station a truck on a road that sees hundreds of deaths every year, and that truck's sole purpose is to deal with collisions that happen on that road.  We average 3-4 a week.

I, myself have the following certifications:

FEMA  ICS 100 and 200  
FEMA  NIMS 700 and 800  
Low Angle Rope Rescue Operations  
Rescue Boat Operations  
Emergency Vehicle Operations  
Vanessa K. Free Emergency Vehicle Liability  
Domestic Violence Mitigation/Identification  
SIDS Management  
Bloodborne Pathogen Safety and Body Substance Isolation  
Vehicle Extrication (Hand Tools)  
Vehicle Extrication (Pneumatic Tools)  
Fire Scene Support and Rehab Operations  
Hospital-grade CPR  
AED Operation  
Emergency First Aid  
ALS Ambulance Operations  

and I've taken the class for, but haven't yet completed the test for 

NREMR Emergency Medical Responder (a 60hr class)

... and all of these are in the last eight months.  Most have to be recertified at least every two years, some every year.  I've spent well over 200 hours in training this year alone.  

We're overseen by several organizations.  We report directly to an EMS provider, and are overseen by the state.  We are required to follow all OSHA, HIPAA, EMS, and Firefighter regulations.

We're an all-volunteer organization.  None of us are paid, from the cheifs all the way down to the greenshirts (junior members -- still in high school).  Some of our members are also paid members of other fire departments and EMS providers that joined because they want to give more.   We have several paramedics on staff, about two dozen EMTs, and nearly everyone else is an EMR.  

When we're not on a call, yes, we joke around.  We have a little bit of fun, but the instant the tones drop, we immediately get down the business, and we don't fuck around until we're clear of the scene.  We're a singular unit, working together and playing off each other's strengths to make sure that everyone, patient included, gets to see their family again.  

And we're very good at it.","I used to work for a volunteer fire department. I was EMS only, but we were treated pretty much the same.

We all had weekly training. We all had to undergo the exact same certification as professional departments. We had to complete the same amount of continuing education as professional departments, but many of us actually took *more* classes than required. Many of the volunteers ended up leaving to join professional departments. Some of the volunteers worked on professional departments *and* the volunteer department. Plus several of the people on the department were full-time professionals - the chief, the assistant chief, and 3-5 staff. 

We were also paid. We weren't paid an hourly wage unless we were on a search and rescue call or active fire because those things could take all day. It was scaled too - the more calls you responded to, the more you were paid per call. It wasn't enough to live off of and we only got paid quarterly (unless you were full-time), but it was a damn nice bonus every few months. 

One of the benefits our town had from having a volunteer squad was that all ambulance trips were 100% paid for by taxes. This isn't everywhere with a volunteer crew (and is actually becoming less and less common) but we were proud of the fact that no one took a financial hit from calling us. That let us take care of people who really needed it who wouldn't have called otherwise. Also as far as care goes - we had several people with chemistry PhDs on our department who enjoyed being able to do firefighting as a hobby. That is actually a big deal. Fires are relatively rare in most places and are certainly rare in rural settings. We got maybe one or two working fires a year. Chemical spills and exposures were more common. Having multiple experts on that front made it really easy to react quickly and properly without having to look up chemicals. Very few professional firefighters could tell you about the toxicity of chlorine trifluoride vs sodium chlorine off the top of their head but when a tanker spills that's the kind of information you want fast.

Conversely a number of the local professional departments were staffed primarily by idiots. Not all obviously, but full-timers aren't necessarily professional. In my area another (professional) department was hit with a lawsuit for duct-taping a patient to a backboard. Another department had issues with leaving Jesus out of the job. 

It depends on where you are and what your department is like. I would still take a crew from my old volunteer department over some of the professional departments I've worked with if given the choice, but I would typically take a professional crew from somewhere with a high call volume over my old volly squad too simply for the amount of experience they would have.",A,A,"I would say Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a detailed explanation of the extensive training and certifications that volunteers go through, as well as the regulations they are required to follow.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the benefits and unique aspects of a volunteer fire department, such as the financial incentives and the expertise of volunteers in specific areas like chemistry. While these are important points, Reply A provides a more comprehensive and detailed argument in favor of volunteer firefighters being just as capable and dedicated as paid professionals."

While important, I don't see why a team of ALL professional firefighters need to do these tasks.

I think maybe thats what i mean more- There should be professionals at all depts, no ALL volunteer depts should exist.- that also solves the money issue with for example 1 pro for every 5 volunteers.

**Ada1629 Also had a good point on my thoughts**
&gt;However, I feel uncomfortable with people working for free - it becomes suspect to me that something more nefarious is going on 
&gt;I also question how stringent the rules are when there is nothing on the line but free labor for those doing the ""hiring""?

If a municipality is small, there is less taxes to pay for these things and also far less risk of an emergency that needs a firefighter.  There is still a risk of course, so members of the community offer their time to go through training and what not.  A lot of these small towns could not afford a full time crew of firefighters.","What about mixed? In my town we have some professionals and some volunteers.

Reply B provides a practical and realistic perspective on the issue by pointing out the benefits of having a mixed team of both professionals and volunteers. It highlights the importance of having volunteers who can handle tasks that don't require the full skill set of a professional firefighter, such as checking for fires and dealing with small emergencies. This approach helps save costs for the municipality while still ensuring that the community is adequately protected.

In contrast, Reply A simply explains the financial constraints that small municipalities face, which may not be as compelling in changing the original poster's view. Reply B offers a more nuanced and practical solution that addresses the concerns raised by the original poster about the effectiveness of relying solely on volunteer firefighters."
predict-explain,"I am a fan of many sports, and all of them seem to take a lot of skill. But golf has always been the one I hated. It's always been boring to me, and it seems that when compared to other sports, golf takes the least skill. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying professional golfers aren't extremely talented, golf is not easy, but compared to anything else, it's nothing. In every other sport, your skill set has to be very large, and you have to be very good at many things. Baseball for instance; you need to be able to bat, field and run. In soccer, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and shoot. In basketball, again, you need to be fast, be able to pass, and be able to shoot. But in golf, you just have to be able to hit a ball towards the hole, and you can only do that one way.

**Edit:** People have pointed out that there are sports that take less skill, like Frisbee and swimming. I guess I was thinking of the slightly more mainstream sports. But my point still stands, aside from that.","&gt;**But in golf, you just have to be able to hit a ball towards the hole, and you can only do that one way.**

You just have to be able to hit a 1.68"" diameter ball 4-5x farther than the length of a football field, across water and sand, through trees and tall grasses, without losing the thing, and then somehow get it into a 4"" diameter hole in the ground

And you have to do it in 3-5 shots.


&gt;**no sport takes less skill than golf.**

Please remember that billiards, dressage, and ultimate frisbee are sports","Hitting a golf ball is one of the hardest things to do in sports.  I don't mean hitting it well either,  I mean just getting the head of the club on the ball.  Especially the driver.  I mean.   Have you ever tried hitting a golf ball?  It's flippin' hard.

Much less hitting it with any sort of accuracy.  Much less the different types of shots you need to be able to do well.  And often times with your feet well below or above the object you're trying to hit.

Make no doubt about it.  Those guys are very good at what they do.",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides specific details and challenges the original poster's assumption about golf requiring less skill.

predict-explain,"First, I know ""egalitarian"" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word ""feminism"" has, but I feel like it's time for a change. 

The internet has caused a lot of voices that may otherwise be drowned out come to the forefront, such as the feminist extremists (or ""feminazis"" if you will). It seems that because of this many people are being turned off by the idea of feminism (myself included) because they associate that word with the people that blame all of life's problems on the patriarchy. 

My friends are starting to joke about feminism and I see more people mocking it every day. I believe it is due to the extremists, and how polarizing and antagonistic a lot of their views are. This stubbornness to stick to the name is causing a lot of people to dismiss, or even despise, the movement and is hurting it's support. I feel that if true feminists were willing to distance themselves from the ""feminazis"" it would stop a lot of animosity people have towards them. 

This might end up being as simple as calling it something different, because maybe the only ones that would keep the term ""feminism"" would be the extremists. They might want to retain the name so as to not give in or lose the fight. Of course there is no way of telling, and they may very well go along with the ""true feminists"" and call themselves egalitarian anyways. 

In either case, I feel like it would be beneficial to cause a clear divide between feminists and feminazis in order to garner more support and to have feminist ideas to be taken more seriously.

Change my view guys!","&gt; My friends are starting to joke about feminism and I see more people mocking it every day.

You don't think this hasn't been happening throughout the entire history of feminism? You can find anti-feminist rhetoric from the 20s that is remarkably similar to what you can find today. Feminists didn't change their presentation to appease those in power in the past, so why should they today?

Rush Limbaugh coined the term ""feminazi"" and you've fallen prey to his rhetoric.","I can see no actual substance to your criticism. ""Feminazi"" is a right wing conservative slur invented by the well known racist, homophobic sexist Rush Limbaugh.

predict-explain,"The constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to tease out meaning. Many other amendments overlap in meaning and could be combined to simplify them while also covering more people. The fact is, it is outdated.

I believe it should be revised every 100 years or so because culture and language are organic. They change based on technology, public conscious, and international relations. Should we follow the advice of a group who believed slavery was acceptable? That thought only white, male, property owners should/could vote? Can you read through the document and understand what was meant or does much of it come across as confusing to todays readers? The world has changed and I believe we need to change with it in order to be relevant. I also believe our ideas and views from today will experience the same degradation over time. In 100 years will the world still care about gun rights? Will the population still speak mostly english or will we add more spanish to our vocabulary? Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had? We cannot know. We should not force our ideas through time, expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers.

What I can't understand is why we are clinging to the past, to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today. We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs. We should update, revise, and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are. I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either. I am saying we should interpret it for today, update it, and use our revised version instead. Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed. It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws. It would take a lot of work, a lot would change, but I believe we would be better for it. CMV

---Edit---
Many responses seem to think I am saying scrap the whole thing and start over. No, I am saying we need an updated, reworded one that uses the meanings as we take them today. All men are equal shoule read all persons, prohibition and its repeal should just be removed, the 15th and 19th should be combined and all inclusive with restrictions put in after the fact. Those are examples of what I mean but not the whole of it.

To CMV you need to show me that having an old, poorly worded document is better than a revision of it in modern terms. It would be hard to do but it would be better for the nation and easier to work with than if we left it be. CMV

Amendments are a suitable way of dealing with that level. What I would suggest is a 10 year audit for all legislatures, state and federal, to scrub their books for laws that are antiquated, written for special interests, or otherwise inadequate/poorly conceived. There are plenty of good examples [here](http://www.dumblaws.com/laws/united-states/alabama). I didn't choose Alabama as an example, they're just the first alphabetically. However they have examples that fit my suggestion quite well, I'd say, such as ""It is illegal to sell peanuts in Lee County after sundown on Wednesday,"" ""Dominoes may not be played on Sunday,"" or ""You may not have an ice cream cone in your back pocket at any time.""","You have assertions that it is poorly worded, however your complaint seems to be it's not written in a modern dialect of english.

So we are going to rewrite it, are we going to use privileged white english, ebonics or spanglish? Maybe we should write it to the english level of a 4th grader? What about the illiterate population, it should be a video-edition because paper is so antiquated.

If it is unclear in any regard, that can be handled with amendments. Translating it risks losing meaning. You ever play that game where someone whispers something in someones ear and it get's passed in a circle and when it comes back it's a totally new word/phrase? That's what will happen if the constitution is re-written every X years.",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A acknowledges the importance of the Constitution as a foundational document but also suggests a practical solution to address outdated laws through regular audits. This approach respects the Constitution while also addressing the issue of antiquated laws. 

On the other hand, Reply B focuses on the potential pitfalls of rewriting the Constitution in a modern dialect, highlighting the risk of losing meaning through translation. While this is a valid concern, it does not offer a concrete solution to the original poster's call for revising the Constitution to make it more understandable and relevant in today's context. 

Overall, Reply A provides a more constructive and practical approach to the issue at hand, making it more likely to persuade the original poster to consider alternative methods of addressing the outdated aspects of the Constitution."
predict-explain,"I submit that Nye's public perception of 'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one 'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before he was every famous. Beyond that, he's just been a guy on TV reading from a script.

Even working at Boeing, his primary job was that of a TV persona: he made the training videos. 

I feel that Obama's use of Nye regarding global warming is strictly an appeal to the populace who grew up watching a kid show, not the opinion of a professional with a background in anything remotely related to climate. This doesn't mean I disagree with what he said, but only disagree with the idea that he should be trusted 'as a scientist'. He's a PR tool in that regard. He only parrots others' research - in everything he's done -not anything he actually observed through his own research. 

Further, simply having a degree in a scientific background makes you aware of that background (he has a bachelor's in *engineering* from Cornell), but that doesn't make you a scientist in the field. I know many people with degrees in one field who work in an entirely different field. A law degree doesn't make you a lawyer, for instance. My father has one and he's a retired contractor: never worked a legal case in his life. Nye's background hardly applies to the vast majority of his TV demonstrations and appearances.

And to the point of Carl Sagan, Neil Tyson, and others: these are actual scientists who have been published, who do(did) research in the field of their degree and beyond. Yes, these men are TV personas, but unlike Nye they're actually also scientists. 

So? Change my view. He's one of my childhood heroes too, but I simply can't accept him as a scientist. I feel that cheapens real work by real scientists.

Edit: [Delta awarded](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bf41n/cmv_bill_nye_is_not_a_real_scientist_in_any/cslnyww), albeit not in a way I had in mind. It's technically correct, [but we all know...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo)

To many of the comments: 

- Education is important and admirable, but that still doesn't make you a scientist in my view. If that's the standard of calling oneself a scientist while being displayed on news media as an expert to be listened to, then really, there's no measure for what an expert is in that regard.  

- There are many qualified scientists who are also good on TV: I still assert Nye's appearances were heavily caused by his association as the funny lab-coat and bow-tie 'science guy' and childhood memories, which is a manipulative and deceptive thing to do when appearing in support of public policy (regardless of my agreement and my own support of the same policy). That deception was not unintentional, but calculated. Herein lies my problem and reasoning for this post. I should note that this still stands as my view, and the delta awarded was awarded basically because I worded the post in a particular way. If anyone would like to address this view, I'd award another delta if the mods are okay with it. 

- I really, honestly think that comparing Nye and people like Neil Tyson and Carl Sagan is an insult to the latter two. That's like comparing your high school bio teacher to the same two men. That's utterly absurd in my mind: Tyson and Sagan contributed more to their fields than Nye ever could at this point. 

- Nye's only contribution I can see, which is the reason for the single delta awarded thus far, has been in the development and design of a hydraulic pressure resonance suppressor used for 747s, to this day. I concede this is a meaningful, scientific advancement for the public made by Bill Nye.","A scientist is an expert in a science. I think that's a fair definition of  scientist we could agree to. Now the question is is he an expert? I say yes because he graduated with a BS in mechanical engineering which is absolutely a science. Experts in mechanical engineering make innovations and inventions via the scientific method. Given that Bill Nye fits this acceptable definition of a scientist, he is therefore a scientist. Is the the same as Tyson or Sagan? Hell no. Tyson and Sagan are astrophysicists and Nye's an engineer. Are they the same? No. Are they all scientists? Yes.","I agree with you 100%. In fact, I was the OP on the other thread about Bill Nye not actually being a scientist and I came away with my V not C'ed. I will tell you what I thought was the best point though: there are lots of people involved in the discovery and dissemination of science and we don't have an umbrella term for all of them. They all contribute to science in some way but only the scientific researcher gets to be called a scientist? Why not call the whole lot of them scientists and the teacher is a science teacher, the researcher is a science researcher, the administrator is a science administrator, etc. The umbrella usage of ""scientist"" would also agree with the publics notion of a scientist even if it doesn't jive with how people that actually do science would use the term.

Its a view that I don't necessarily agree with since the application of the scientific method is the pure grist of science and only the researcher is doing this, but I think that it was at least an interesting thought.",A,A,"I would say that reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a clear and concise definition of a scientist as an expert in a science, and argues that Bill Nye fits this definition as he graduated with a BS in mechanical engineering, which is a science. The argument is logical and straightforward, using a specific definition to support the claim that Bill Nye can be considered a scientist. 

On the other hand, reply B presents an interesting perspective on the umbrella term for all those involved in science, but it doesn't directly address the original poster's concerns about Bill Nye's qualifications as a scientist. While it raises a valid point about the various roles within the field of science, it doesn't directly counter the original poster's arguments about Bill Nye's lack of scientific research and contributions. 

Overall, reply A provides a more direct and convincing argument that is more likely to change the original poster's view on Bill Nye's status as a scientist."
predict-explain,"I like Bernie, love his politics in fact. I doubt there is a politician I agree more with.  I like the fact that, unlike most politicians, his rhetoric matches his actions. Whether it's filibustering Bush's tax cut extensions, standing up against Citizens United or proposing amendments to the Patriotic Act, this is a guy who's politics match mine.

That being said, I find it problematic for a guy who's never sat as a Democrat and doesn't caucus as a Democrat to be running to be their leader. 

CMV Reddit, you can do it.

EDIT: Far too many of these arguments are based on how folk view either Clinton or Sanders, which to me is inconsequential. The crux of the issue is whether or not an independent should be allowed to run under the party ticket.","FYI, Sanders actually does caucus *with* the Democrats, just not as one.  Technicality, I know, but he's not alien to the party.

Sanders is running as a Democrat, which is to say that he is a Presidential candidate seeking the backing of the Democratic party as he believes his ideals align with the party's platform (which they overwhelmingly do) and that democrats should vote for him.  If democratic voters agree, and elect him in the primaries, the Democratic party will endorse him as the candidate that they support for the primary election.  Anyone can run as a candidate for either party, regardless of past affiliation- it's about where you stand on the issues now.  There have been more than a few politicians who have switched parties entirely, some successfully (though none that I'm aware of were for President).

Sanders is running as a Democrat to capture the support and resources of a huge party and its voters so he has a better shot of being President.  As much as I'm sure we'd all love it, being elected as an Independent is simply not possible in 2016.","If the Democratic party decides to nominate him, it is their choice, not his. Although a candidate could decline a nomination, it's uncommon unless the ""third party"" in question is going to damage their standing with their base because it's a Neo-Nazi party or something. 

Most major candidates will be endorsed by multiple parties. A Republican might also be endorsed by the Conservative party a registered Democrat endorsed by the Green party etc.. 

If both the Republican party and the Democratic party wanted to nominate the same individual technically they could do it.  

The President isn't the actual ""leader"" of their respective political parties. But the figurehead or mascot for all practical purposes. They don't set policy, they don't get to dictate the party platform (although they will likely have input). 

So if Bernie Sanders gets the ""nod"" from the Dems.. it's not that he's going to be running as a Democrat, the Dems are going to be running as Sandersites.",A,A,I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

Reply A presents a logical argument and provides information that may help the original poster see Sanders' decision to run as a Democrat in a different light.
predict-explain,"* As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.  
* Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic.
* Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. 
* I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the ""warm glow"" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. 
* Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture. Because of climate change, and the overuse of farmlands we may reach that point in the near future.

It fails to take into account a number of things. Firstly, there is another definition of 'utility' - the maximisation of pleasure. Letting sick children die is an exercise in cold pragmatism, and not an action (or consequence of deliberate inaction, more specifically) that anyone would relish or enjoy. There is undeniable value in allowing and encouraging a society to feel good about itself, and failure to take that into account would result in a society that has less esteem in itself, and therefore a society that functions less efficiently, and is more likely to descend into dysfunction. Indeed, Jeremy Bentham, considered the founder of modern utilitarianism, said that, ""it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong"". And while your suggestions would probably provide a small economic boost, this does not make up for the inevitable loss of happiness that such actions would cause.

To look outside of utilitarian philosophy, I would also hold that your suggestion runs contrary to the entire point of government, which is look after its citizens, to safeguard their lives and livelihoods. A government should - and most, thankfully, do, to at least some extent - look after the needs of its most vulnerable citizens, *regardless of whether or not this is of any economic benefit*. Taking a ruthlessly pragmatic approach to the lives and well-being of the citizens in their care is not the mark of a functional government trying to foster a stable society, but of a government trying to trim society down to its bare, self-sustainable bones - in other words, not a government trying to its best for the people, but a government trying to make itself obsolete in one of the most brutal ways possible. 

As for your Malthusian argument, I think the number of sick children being kept alive in the ways you describe is low enough to have a negligible effect on the total human population.","Your entire argument sees human life from an instrumental perspective.  If life were just dollars and cents followed by investments for more dollars and cents then your argument would be pretty ironclad.  

But what if government's role is *not* to mimic business?  Instead government intends to create sustainable societies where all members have an opportunity for a life worth living.  The thing about that statement is that *all members* means **all members**.  

If life has not just an instrumental value, but an intrinsic value then it is our duty to protect it.  Inversely if life only has instrumental value, then we do not need to protect it in other senses either.  If it's cheaper to send 40x as many soldiers as it is to build better weapons then we just throw soldiers at the problem.  If it's cheaper to threaten the lives of workers than to demand that they wear protective gear then we just throw people into the machine.

Most people would agree that life itself has a value.  You are attempting to draw the line at the types of lives which have value while disregarding the rest in some sort of culling.",B,B,"I believe that reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B brings up the important point that human life should not be viewed solely from an instrumental perspective, but rather has intrinsic value that should be protected. It challenges the idea that government should operate like a business and emphasizes the importance of creating sustainable societies where all members have the opportunity for a life worth living. This argument appeals to a sense of morality and duty to protect life, rather than just focusing on economic factors. 

In contrast, reply A focuses more on the economic implications of the original poster's argument and the potential loss of happiness that could result from letting sick children die. While this is a valid point, it does not address the deeper ethical concerns raised by reply B about the intrinsic value of human life. 

Overall, reply B provides a more compelling argument that is likely to resonate with the original poster on a moral level and potentially lead to a change in their view."
predict-explain,"I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form.

The facts are:

* McDonalds brewed (and continues to brew) coffee at standard brewing temperatures of 200F 
* McDonalds holds and serves its coffee after brewing between 170-180F (which is no different than most other restaurants)
* McDonalds has *NOT* lowered the temperature of their coffee, nor have the changed the temps at which they hold and serve coffee

To me, the purchaser of coffee acknowledges the fact that they're buying near-boiling water when they decided ""hey, I want coffee"". Change my view, please.

[sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants)


EDIT:

Looks like I screwed up by questioning the frivolousness of the case. Even if the blame doesn't lie on McDonalds, the case does not seem to be frivolous in the slightest. This was an easy one. Thanks guys.","At the time of the suit McDonalds was serving coffee between 180-190F which is hot enough to cause 3rd degree burns within seconds.  Prior to Ms. Liebeck there had been 700 claims made against McDonalds for serving coffee to hot.  McDonalds admits that coffee served at that temperature is too hot for consumption as it burns the mouth and throat.  [See WSJ article](http://www.business.txstate.edu/users/ds26/Business%20Law%202361/Misc/McDonalds%20coffee.pdf)

&gt;A vascular surgeon determined that Liebeck suffered full thickness burns (or third-degree burns) over 6 percent of her body, including her inner thighs, perineum, buttocks, and genital and groin areas. She was hospitalized for eight days, during which time she underwent skin grafting. Liebeck, who also underwent debridement treatments, sought to settle her claim for $20,000, but McDonalds refused. [See](http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm)



So i summation they **have** lowered the temps of the coffee to under 160 according to test conducted after the verdict, she had awful burns over her body, they knew it was an issue yet did nothing.

Sure. It's unreasonable not to expect a cup of coffee to be very hot.

But McDonalds knew that people were being unreasonable. They had lots of records of previous customers who got burned because they didn't expect the coffee to be so hot. If you *know* your product is hurting people, and you can help prevent that harm by writing ""DANGER: HOT"" in big letters on the cup, it seems entirely fair to say you have to do it.",B,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because reply A provides specific details about the temperature of the coffee, the extent of the burns suffered by the plaintiff, and the history of previous claims against McDonald's regarding their hot coffee. Additionally, the reply mentions that McDonald's did lower the temperature of their coffee following the verdict, indicating that they recognized the issue. Reply A also includes links to sources supporting the information provided. Overall, reply A presents a more comprehensive argument with evidence to back up its points, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"Generally speaking, you have two sides on the ""Fat Debate"": the fat acceptance movement (Healthy At Every Size, etc.) and the fat shamers (who cajole fat people into losing weight, with either benign or malicious intentions.

First of all, I don't buy HAES. I believe that anyone of any size can be *healthier* at that size. If I start jogging once a week, I probably won't lose weight, but I'll be a teeny-tiny bit healthier and that's good. 

Secondly, BMI is an overall population indicator. There are of course given people who are overweight who are healthier than given people who are within normal range. Same goes for given people who are underweight vs people in normal range. However, I would state that *in general*, the further you slide on the scale from 22.5 in either direction, the further you're getting from optimal.

However, wherever people lie on that scale - underweight -&gt; optimal -&gt; fat is none of your fucking business whatsoever.

You are not a stakeholder in a stranger's health and people would do well to keep their mouths shut about other people's appearance. If you *are*  stakeholder in their health (and this is exclusively limited to loved ones and the person's healthcare practitioners) then maybe you get to say something. *Maybe*.

The best analogy for this is smoking. I smoke and am slightly overweight (~10lb) and it is certainly the smoking that is more detrimental to my health than the few extra pounds.

I *know* that smoking is bad for me - I'm not an idiot. I view the HAES as a bit like ""Healthy No Matter How Much You Smoke"". It's not true, it may even be damaging. On the other hand, encouraging hardened smokers to run around despite being smokers ain't a bad thing. Attack the campaign, if you must, but leave the people alone.

It does not matter how many people tell me that smoking is bad for me. Their statements are uninvited, irritating and will do precisely nothing to change my habits. They may even reinforce them. 

It is *none* of their business if I smoke.

You know when you're eating pizza and you have that one vegan health nut friend who tells you about how pepperoni is full of carcinogens and dairy will cause all kinds of damage to you? That, **at best** is what fat shamers come off like.

I'm not saying there shouldn't be public health campaigns (much like we have anti-smoking campaigns), just that YOU PERSONALLY should never say a damn thing about a stranger's weight, EVER. 

*EDIT: Good discussion, guys. I'm going on a delta spree now, because as /u/ThereOnceWasAMan put it: ""OPs view is that ""others' weight is none of your business"", not ""you shouldn't shame people for being overweight"". They are annoyingly correct in that that is how I *should* have phrased it. 

*EDIT 2*: Work has come up and I have to run off for the evening. I'll come back to this to give ∆s to the deserving. Sorry for the delay!

Don't bully fat people, kids. It helps no one.

If people in your society are overweight, you'll have to contribute more money and effort to cover the cost of their choices. That's the fundamental argument behind why anyone else's concerns are your business. You can apply it to obesity, gun control, taxes, drug use or pretty much any other issue. As for whether this is a good argument or not, you can argue it both ways. Political philosophers from Aristotle to Plato to Hobbes have debated this point for centuries.","Define stakeholder.  Because here I agree with you.  If your health has no impact on me, then it is none of my business.

However your health DOES impact me financially.  In any western country you are going to consume publicly subsidized healthcare services (the US is an odd duck but odds are you are either receiving medicare, medicaid, subsidized obamacare premiums, or health insurance through an employer which is receiving tax credits / driving up coworker's premiums).  That means you being fat costs me money.

In fact it costs huge amounts of money, which is being borrowed and which interest is accumulating on, to care for the fat people of our society.

One of the catches that is never discussed in public healthcare debates is that as soon as I start paying for your unhealthy choices I become a stakeholder in your health, and I should then have a say.",A,A,"I would say that reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B brings up the point that the original poster's health choices do impact others financially, especially in a publicly subsidized healthcare system. This argument reframes the issue from a personal choice to a societal impact, which may make the original poster reconsider their stance on weight and health. Reply A, while bringing up the issue of higher premiums for overweight individuals, does not delve as deeply into the societal impact of one's health choices."
predict-explain,"To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to apply to everyone in society. I am, however, mildly concerned or at least intrigued as to where this debate or issue ends.

The reason it's troubling for me is that the most common arguments used to support gay marriage are that ""love is love"" and ""loving who you choose is your right"". What these arguments implicitly say is that the necessary criteria to be allowed to marry is that you love that which you are marrying.

Now I won't delve into the typical response of ""Next thing you know, it'll be legal to marry your pets!"" because I find that particularly hyperbolic and non-productive to the discussion. But I do feel that this open mindset of the definition of marriage will definitely lead to a future debate about what ""marriage"" is.

I believe that the next group to demand legal marriage rights will be polygamists, and that the same arguments of ""love is love"" will still apply. My fear is that despite this good ruling today, we have opened up the door to extremely loose and liberal interpretations of the meaning of ""marriage"" to include anything we want it to under the law.

~~Further, I believe that polygamy is harmful to society and that raising children in a polygamous is harmful to their growth. I believe that polygamy is not a natural arrangement for humans, and that no matter what, it will be emotionally damaging to at least one person in this ""relationship""~~.

But then as I type those words, I realize that the exact same things were said about gay marriage in recent history. So, Reddit, CMV that this supreme court ruling isn't going to evolve into a culture of people being able to marry whoever (or whatever) or however many people they want.

Edit: Let's avoid the moral implications of Polygamy for now. I shouldn't have typed out my personal views on the matter because it's really not what I'm interested in arguing (whether it's right or wrong). I'm interested in hearing legally, why this SC ruling will not lead to a case law precedent used to affirm Polygamy rights in the future. I ask this because all through this debate, most advocates for gay marriage rights said that comparisons of the movement to polygamy were ridiculous.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","I've always been very intrigued by the 'slippery slope' argument.

While I personally am not interested in polygamy, what's wrong with it? 

It's natural for humans to live in groups. 'Tribes' or 'family' whatever you would like to call it. I don't see anything wrong with families that have several adults to act as role models for children. I just can't see why it would be detrimental to children to be raised in that environment. Isn't this more of an assumption you're making rather than being based on any sort of evidence?

For your argument being that it would be emotionally damaging. What sort of life would you lead if you didn't get hurt emotionally at some point? These people are consenting adults, they can make their own decisions. As long as there isn't a sex bias (e.g. men can have many wives but not the other way around), then I think that people can make their own decision about whether a polygamous relationship is something they want. People get hurt and taken advantage of anyway in this society where only 2 person marriage is legal.

The main argument that I ponder going against it is that marriage does afford certain legal privileges. But in thinking about it, if these can be already be taken advantage of in a two person marriage (e.g. marrying for a visa) would polygamy really make it more of a problem? I don't really think it would. The same difficulties that are present now would still be present.

I'm really interested to know if you have any good arguments against polygamy other than the fact that you are not interested in it personally. I think a lot of arguments against it are based on assumptions people make because they personally don't want to be in that kind of relationship, rather than being based on anything solid.","&gt;I believe that the next group to demand legal marriage rights will be polygamists, and that the same arguments of ""love is love"" will still apply.

I think this is unlikely, simply because polygamy is not a one-size-fits-all arrangement. Even if polyamorous individuals want their three, four, or five-person relationships acknowledged under the law, there's more obstacles than just legal recognition—the first obstacle, and probably the biggest obstacle to polyamorous relationships in the first place, is negotiating the terms of the relationship.

Marriage is a lot of pair-exclusive privileges, rights, commitments, and responsibilities. Larger benefits from certain benefits programs if married. Sponsorship of a spouse for immigration purposes. Parenting rights. Treating held property as shared. Declaring next-of-kin for survivor benefits, emergency medical decisions, and wrongful death lawsuits. Spousal Privilege. Child support. And the list goes on and on and on.

Each one of those needs to be worked out in a polyamorous relationship, determined individually and often contentiously in the long-term. Unless, of course, the polyamorous relationship is using the relatively common model of ""a primary-partnership pair, alongside other groups of primary-partnership pairings and individuals, existing within a family-like community,"" in which case marriage as it exists post-Obergefell v. Hodges is sufficient to assign those rights and privileges effectively—effectively, sufficient to recognize their relationships.

Simply put, there's not going to be a push for legalization of polygamy because there's not enough of an agreement on what polygamy is. It's either too different from marriage for enough people to agree on it as a one-size-fits-all institution, or too similar to marriage (and accessible enough to the individuals in question) that there's no need to ask for a change.

At most, there might be a push to allow for assignment of those rights and privileges to different people under contract law. But even that seems relatively unlikely.",B,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a detailed explanation of the practical obstacles to legalizing polygamy, highlighting the complexities and challenges that come with recognizing polyamorous relationships under the law. The response effectively addresses the concerns raised by the original poster about the potential slippery slope argument, showing that the unique nature of polygamous relationships makes it unlikely for there to be a significant push for legalization. In contrast, Reply A focuses more on questioning the assumptions and biases against polygamy without providing as strong of a counterargument to the original poster's concerns. Overall, Reply B provides a more thorough and reasoned response that is likely to challenge the original poster's views on the issue."
predict-explain,"With all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned in that way everything seemed to go more or less fine (of course there were others interspersed but that was the majority of viewpoints). As more and more groups began to be introduced there were shall we say competing interests. They correctly are asking for space within the community as well. However, the problem is White men had already kind of adopted this space as a place where they could discuss their problems without feeling guilty etc. For example, when people complain about false rape charges getting to the front page constantly or reverse discrimination cases etc etc. I think the SJW this and that we often see is just pushback from White Men feeling ""invaded"" for lack of a better word. I'm not saying this is right. I think this last ush of banning subs etc also has the same implications first FatPeopleHate is seen as appealing to women and feminists. Then Coontown seen as appealing to minorities. I think its reflective of White Men feeling like all other people get to have their spaces etc. but they never do. What I got from the threads is that people feel betrayed and I believe that feeling is genuine. 

So here's the actual CMV. Why can't everyone just let White Guys have this one. Why can't we all just either accept that this is and will be a site that leans towards issues important to (straight) White Men and will be biased towards their opinions or leave and go to a different site. Its not like their aren't other hubs. And I'm not saying that there shouldn't be differences of opinion etc. (newsflash: not all White guys think the same). But just as anyone is welcome to watch Logo and comment on it etc no one would complain that the content is too gay or be upset if anti-gay things or things that appear to be anti-gay get the equivalent of downvoted (and no I'm not comparing experiences in any way). I also think that if people recognized this gping in there would be less abrasive push back from the trolls and ""dark side"" of reddit.


Edit: reply from /r/nannyhap produced new idea that perhaps having a place that tolerates hateful views makes for an artificial influx of them. Doesn't quite change my view all the way but definitely something I hadn't considered.

Homophobia, transphobia, fat-shaming, racism, sexism, blah-dee-blah, are all abusive behaviors.

Like, I see what you're saying, I really do, but the existence of the current troll culture (or ""dark side: of Reddit) stems out of the fact that Reddit and similar outlets have traditionally been echo chambers for harmful opinions. They didn't start out as being ""white male"" opinions, but many young white men have adopted them because they've found a community that encourages that sort of behavior, and things just get worse from there.

When it comes to spaces, here's the cold, hard facts: if there are spaces where it is actually unsafe to be white and male (and straight), they are few and far between. White males are typically attacked not for whiteness or maleness (or straightness), but for harmful opinions about other communities, which are not fundamental to their straightness/whiteness/maleness.

So the number of spaces for straight white males has not decreased significantly. The number of spaces for people of any sex/race/gender/orientation to act like total dillholes and abuse other groups of people has decreased, and if you're associating those opinions with whiteness and maleness, I have to fundamentally disagree.","Wait, I'm a white guy. What about being white makes me okay with racism, sexism, harassment, and just general diversity of opinions? The idea that SJW's are taking over reddit is just people freaking out over a bogeyman.

It points out that harmful opinions and abusive behavior are not fundamental to being white or male, but rather stem from communities that encourage such behavior. Reply A also challenges the notion that there are fewer spaces for straight white males, but rather that the decrease in spaces is related to abusive behavior towards other groups, not towards their own identity.

predict-explain,"People seem to feel right now that Sanders is just not well-known enough to even have a chance at the presidency, and that it will stay that way. Everyone has mostly accepted that it will be Clinton vs. some ill-fated Republican, and that Sanders stands no chance. 

I believe this is fully inaccurate, and anyone who believes this must have forgotten what age we are living in. This is the age of the internet, of instant communication, and of viral sensations. The amount of commercials a candidate is able to put themselves on does not determine their chance at winning. From what I've seen in just the past couple of months, Bernie Sanders has a very strong presence on the internet. He's old, but has the progressive ideals and values of most younger Americans. I think his name has been and will be spreading like wildfire over the next 16 months. And that's the other part people are forgetting...we still have a whopping 16 months till the election. That ""Alex from Target"" kid got popular in about a day for no reason whatsoever. Now think about someone who could potentially lead a nation - someone who many people are very passionate about supporting. Sanders will become just as much a household name as other prominent candidate.

**TL;DR - Through the help of the internet and a shitload of time, Bernie Sanders has very good chance at winning this thing.**

When you are using anecdotal evidence like this you have to consider many massive voter demographics arent very vocal on the internet. Especially old people, the technological illiterate, religious folks and so on. Plus you have to consider how vocal young people are on the internet but how few of us actually vote. 

Honestly my personal opinion is that the dem primary is the actual election of 2016. I dont like sanders chances of winning the primary but I do like his chances of winning the actual election should he beat clinton.


Basically the people you see talking about Bernie on facebook, reddit,etc. are not representative of everyone that is actually voting. I still meet people who have never even heard of sanders and basically made a gut call on voting for hillary weeks ago.","I would argue that a Bernie Sanders win in the primary would be the left equivalent of Goldwaters win back in the day. Heavy appeal to a small subset of Americans. Socialism in name is not really tolerated by the people who reliably vote (elderly, ironically biggest recipients of socialism).

America actually voted for Bush the second time is my argument and may have voted for McCain without Palin.

This reply presents a more balanced view of the situation and raises valid points that the original poster may not have considered. On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the potential negative aspects of Sanders' candidacy without providing as much depth or nuance in its argument."
predict-explain,"Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be ""free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't mean freedom from consequences from everyone else"". If it's on the internet it is equally likely that this [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1357/) will be shown. This does seem at first to be a reasonable point of view. However, I believe it is flawed for several related reasons.

The first reason is that underestimates the power of the public. Just because the state is not infringing your right does not mean others cannot. With other rights this is accepted as part of the system. For instance, if a company refused to serve or allow access to black people that would be considered a violation of their rights despite it not being the government. In the same way, you couldn't claim a country has gender equality if women can't be get a job, despite there being no law against hiring women. Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech.

Secondly, the right to free speech includes the right to unimpeded free speech, if that makes sense. It is not enough to be allowed to say what you want, you have to be allowed to communicate to who you want. It makes more tense in terms of letters. Freedom of speech is not fulfilled by allowing me to write letters, it is only fulfilled by allowing their delivery. Using the example from the comic, continually showing someone the door is the same as standing by the pillar box and shredding the letters as I post them.

The final reason is that extreme reactions to someone's use of free speech can restrict it by effectively punishing them for exercising their right. If I punched someone for suggesting marmite was a valid option for toast, would I not be restricting their right to free speech? Equally, if I was sacked for making a racist reddit post, am I not being punished for exercising my right to freedom of speech? I'm not entirely convinced on this point because it might restrict someone else's freedom of speech to criticise or their freedom of association to not have to put up with me, but I would still say there is some validity to this point.

Just to be clear, I don't think freedom of speech should never be restricted but I do think those restrictions should be acknowledged which the phrase ""freedom of speech, not freedom from consequences"" does not. 

Edit: This has been quite an intense discussion. I'm beginning to think there is too much free speech. Seriously though, there has been a lot of good comments and I'll try to respond as quick as I can, although that may be tomorrow for some. I haven't missed the irony of the downvote button being used to disagree on topic about free speech, but I suppose there's always one. I have given out two deltas so far, but they tangential so the bulk of the view remains unchanged as I write this edit.

Some people seem to be confused about what I mean by a private entity. I simply mean someone who isn't the state or acting as an agent of the state. I never meant to imply that I would start talking shit in your living room. Freedom of speech doesn't make crimes less illegal do to be clear I'm not advocating that in the slightest.

Edit 3: Some people seem to be under the impression I want to expand the laws regarding free speech, probably because I'm a neo-Nazi Grand Dragon or something. That's not the case. I think the current situation I more than satisfactory. My view relates to the opinions towards free speech. To sum it up more succinctly, I don't think people can claim to be pro-free speech, when society is more than willing to restrict it. I'm *not* saying the restrictions are bad, I'm saying people should be more honest about them.

A lot of the comments have struggled with what the view is, despite it being repeated multiple times. I'm not interested in acting as reading adviser. If your comment doesn't address the view, I'm not going to bother responding.

/u/Vordreller found this bastardised version of the [comic](http://sealedabstract.com/rants/re-xkcd-1357-free-speech/), and from John Stuart Mill onwards, I agree with the sentiments the creator expresses. If you want to see my argument in comic form, you couldn't get much closer than that.

This is why people struggle with free speech. 

The short answer is no. You can say whatever you want. You can't however say what you want and expect others not to react to your words. I can't go to my friends house and say that his wife is a cunt and expect to be invited over next week. I can't tell my employer that I feel that black people are inferior to whites and then expect to represent my boss by wearing his company's name badge to work. 

You are asking for speech with no consequences. That has never been protected and never will. 

A company can remove you for saying racist comments. An online company doesn't have to provide a platform for all types of speech. edit a word","&gt;  if a company refused to serve or allow access to black people that would be considered a violation of their rights despite it not being the government.

Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech.

The major distinction I see here is that race, gender, sexuality, etc., those are all things that a person can't control those things about themselves. You can't decide not to be black or a woman or gay or whatever for a while because you're around people who don't like those types of people. You can try and hide it or downplay that part of you, but (at least for race and gender) those are characteristics about you that are immediately visible, permanent, and part of you. 

Speech is different. You don't ever *have* to speak. If you believe strongly that the Holocaust didn't happen, that doesn't mean that whenever you walk by a synagogue you automatically and uncontrollably start spewing out anti-Semitic comments. Speech is an action, whereas race or gender are not actions but qualities of a person which they can't reasonably change. 

That's why you can't ban someone for being black but you can ban them from shouting racial slurs in your restaurant. They can't control what race they are, but they can control what they can say. That's a fundamental difference.",B,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a clear distinction between characteristics that are inherent and uncontrollable (such as race and gender) and actions that can be controlled (such as speech). By highlighting this difference, Reply B effectively argues that restrictions on speech are not the same as restrictions on inherent characteristics. This distinction helps to address the original poster's concerns about the consequences of free speech and the potential limitations on it by private entities. 

Additionally, Reply B's explanation is logical and well-reasoned, making it more likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially lead to a shift in their perspective on the issue of free speech."

Additionally, it's probably substantially easier to move there (if you get a bachelors you can probably move temporarily under a TN visa to try it out), and there are some other perks as well such as your Canada Pension Plan payments counting towards Social Security and vice versa.

If you want a more ""foreign"" experience than you'll get in the English speaking parts of Canada, you can also drive over to Quebec and spend some time there.  Quebec is much more different from the rest of Canada than any part of the US is different from any other part.","I'm Danish. My workplace has roughly 60% foreigners from all over the world, except Africa and the middle east - not because they won't hire them, but because we get 0 applications, probably because its a tech company and people from there don't have the qualifications.

So, I know second hand from them what it's like coming here from different places in the world. Basically, the more Danish you look and act, the easier a time you will have. 

You will face stigmatization if you are from Eastern Europe, since they have a bad rep among a lot of Danes, due to a lot of home robberies and burglaries committed by Eastern Europeans.

If you are black you stand out a lot, and will face a lot of fear from people, and in return sometimes being treated ""with caution"". The same probably goes, albeit to a lesser degree, if you look like you are from the middle east.

If you are American you will face some prejudices that you might be arrogant and stupid. Generally, those prejudices only come from stupid people.

Not speaking Danish is not a problem if you decide to live in one of the larger cities. Danes generally do not mind speaking English, but older people in the smaller cities often have a view that if you move here, it's disrespectful not to learn the language. 

You will pay a high tax. The more you earn, the higher a tax percentage. If you earn below 250.000 DKK a year, you pay 38% in tax. (These numbers are from memory, could be slightly different now).

predict-explain,"The word ‘natural’ implies something derived from nature, separate from humans. But why is there this distinction? Humans are obviously a part of and are derived from nature.

For instance it’s meaningless to me when someone says ‘it’s only natural’. What isn’t natural?

Furthermore, even if you use the strictest definition of the word, it's still useful to distinguish it from the supernatural. Lots of concepts involve the supernatural from the vampire shows on the CW to the entire concept of God. Given how much time and energy human society devotes to religion, the natural and supernatural distinction comes in handy often.","We as humans need a word to differentiate between things that do and do not occur without human intervention. The words we use are natural and artificial. 

I totally see your point. Humans do come from nature. but what is your solution? We should make a new word that means what natural currently means? Why would we do that, though? We already have a word with that definition. The only reason to do it would be if there was a lot of confusion about they way it currently is.

Being a white male, you are statistically more likely to be in the front running for those 80 other scholarships. This is not your fault, as you didn't choose to be a white male, but the 20 people who are in the front running for the other scholarships didn't choose that either, and I'm sure if the system was fair, they would be advocating for the elimination of special requirement scholarships, but the fact of the matter is the system isn't fair. 

Let's take a look at the inner-city public high school system for a moment. These schools are woefully underfunded, woefully underserved, and (generally speaking) are largely minority based. Chances are the students who attend said high school will not be afforded the privileges of those who attend a more well-to-do high school in the suburbs (eg SAT/ACT prep courses, AP classes, etc.), thus making them (potentially) less likely to have the requirements necessary for certain scholarships. This is not the fault of the student, it is the fault of a broken system.

Long story short, I suppose, people from traditionally more privileged heritages (eg: white males) are more likely to obtain the criteria necessary for scholarships, based purely on the failings of the public school system, and that is why race and gender based scholarships apply. Because those students who get race based scholarships prove to be just as successful at the college level, but perhaps wouldn't get the chance if not for scholarships geared towards them.","Scholarships are by their very nature exclusive. Either they discriminate on merit or they discriminate based on race/gender. Many schools use scholarships to promote diversity, but not necessarily just racial diversity. They know that they can't get every applicant they accept to enroll in the school, so a lot of schools will pad their ""yield"" (percentage of students accepted who enroll) by offering generous merit scholarships to top students. In the same way, if a school wants to help improve its perception with regards to diversity or race relations or social justice, it's using scholarships to incentivize students with particular traits to enroll.

The scholarships that are designed for people who are not purely academic achievers were never meant for those students anyway. They wouldn't exist without the school needing to create a diverse environment. Colleges can't exist without the student bodies that make them up. Many colleges just hand out their scholarships to help mold their incoming class into the perfect blend (in their eyes).",B,B,"I believe reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a thoughtful explanation of why scholarships based on race and gender exist, highlighting the systemic inequalities that certain groups face in education. It acknowledges the unfairness of the system and the need for scholarships that aim to level the playing field for underprivileged students. This response is more likely to challenge the original poster's perspective and encourage them to consider the broader societal context in which scholarships operate."
predict-explain,"Most colleges do not require trigonometry for admissions, and do not require students to take a trigonometry course. It seems unfair that the SAT would include this in the math section. Some will argue that it makes sure students are ""well rounded,"" but it's incredibly unfair to use this to test a student's aptitude for college. When I was in high school, I had an 89% overall GPA. I got mid-range scores on the reading and writing sections of the SAT, but did very poorly on the math section. Because of this, I was denied admission to many colleges which I applied to. I understand that my scores in reading and writing were average, but it was the low math score which really hurt my chances of admission. This might seem like a personal argument, but the fact remains that I'm sure many students would agree with me. I understand including algebra and geometry, but I don't see why they include trigonometry. This is a person's future which they are dealing with.

EDIT: Of the five colleges I applied to, I was rejected by two of them, but was accepted by three of them.

My personal opinion of the SAT and ACT is less that is it to make a ""well rounded"" person and more to set a bar for entrance into selective schools.  To your opening point, the SAT did not prevent you from going to college it just prevented you for attending a more selective college, one that desires a higher level of math knowledge than the ones that accepted you.

It has little to do with you and more to do with the statistics of placing people.  If someone has a better understanding of math they will be able to understand more things in general (all else being held constant).","Trigonometry is a basic staple of most college level math courses and should have been touched upon enough in Geometry that you could do well on it. An SAT score is meant to compliment your work in high school. The SAT itself isn't a measure of what you have learned in high school, but more of a measure of what you still need to learn. Low grades combined with a high SAT score show that you know more of what you are required to learn in college and can be moved ahead with courses though you may fail to do work.

The problem you have isn't that you didn't do well on the SAT, it's that you were average with everything else.

On the other hand, Reply A focuses more on the importance of math knowledge and how it can impact a student's chances of admission to more selective colleges. While it provides valuable insight into the role of math in college admissions, it may not address the original poster's concerns about the fairness of including trigonometry in the SAT math section. 

Overall, Reply B's emphasis on work ethic and the purpose of the SAT as a measure of readiness for college may be more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was entirely removed.

A good sniper has no real counter apart from another sniper, making them frustrating to play against. A majority of the other weapons have damage fall-off to discourage long-range play, further separating the sniper as a class. 

As far as I can tell, snipers mainly exist to pick off slow moving or high value targets, which the spy already does and does in a more interesting (to play as and against) way.

I can't see any way the sniper, sitting at the back of the map away from the action, adds to the game (as a side note, I also think the removal of sniper would do nothing but good for the class diversity on pubs).

Well, an entire group of people would lose their main and would most likely stop playing. Also, all the cosmetics and weapons for sniper would become worthless, which will impact the economy and fuck a lot of people over. 

Now, I'm not a competitive TF2 player, but I can tell you that sniper adds a lot. Without sniper, people don't have to be nearly as careful with their movement. Also, Sniper has the ability to turn the game around by making important picks like demo or medic. Without him, the losing team has a small chance of recovering if they lose an important class. 

As for pubs,  sniper fullfills the same role as he does in competitve, which makes him valuable. 

&gt; A good sniper has no real counter apart from another sniper, making them frustrating to play against

A good sniper can be countered by good spies, good soldiers (depends on the map) and a good scout (depends on the map). Also, if the team is careful and has good movement, average snipers will have a hard time picking them off. 

They're only frustrating to play against if your team sucks, which is true for the rest of the classes as well. 

&gt; As far as I can tell, snipers mainly exist to pick off slow moving or high value targets, which the spy already does and does in a more interesting (to play as and against) way.

He also denies the enemy certain paths, something the spy can't do. He also has different counters. 

&gt;  I also think the removal of sniper would do nothing but good for the class diversity on pubs

You can make the same case for scouts, spies and engineers when playing on defense. 

Sniper is an annoying class. As someone who spends most of his time playing Heavy (inb4 n00b), Medic and other Combo classses, I hate sniper and Spy. However, they have their place in the game even though I don't like them.","As someone who mained sniper in TF2, I can assure you that sniping in TF2 has its uses. Spies can't move as quickly as scouts or medics, normally. Snipers serve not only to kill high value targets but also targets which focus on agility. That guerrilla scout which picks off enemies slowly? Sniper can deal with that. That rocket-jumping soldier which no one can shoot? Snipers can pick the soldier out of the air easily because of an easily predictable trajectory. Counters to snipers come with the spy (if the sniper is a stationary shooter), the pyro (flames disrupt aim), and the demoman (area denial from arcing weapons like the grenade launcher and the stickybomb launcher). Hell, even a soldier's splash damage if used properly can deny a sniper's vantage point. With all these reasons, how is a sniper not a valuable class in TF2?",B,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a more detailed and comprehensive explanation of the value of the sniper class in TF2. It addresses the potential consequences of removing the sniper class, such as impacting the player base and the in-game economy. Additionally, reply A gives examples of how a good sniper can be countered by other classes and how the sniper adds strategic depth to the game by being able to make crucial picks.

predict-explain,"**Update: So I think I kind of changed my view.. but also I feel like the discussion is running in circles a little which is probably not anyones fault but just the nature of the topic. The dog-biting problem might not be as bad as I perceived it to be, especially in public spaces. So one could argue that a leash and breeding documentation is enough to have appropiate security. I really don't trust leashes when I cross a dog on the walkway and I feel like owners are really lax about them where I live. This belongs in their responsibilty, though. Anyway, I really enjoyed the little discussion with you guys. I consider my first CMV to be quite succesful :) I'll be giving out Deltas as soon as I figured out how.In germany there is a movement that demands muzzles only for especially ""aggressive"" breeds of dogs and every dogs' origin should be tested. Sounds like a good compromise for me.**



Hello there. I'm no native speaker so please have mercy :)

After trying to be rational about this topic for a long time, I could only come up with the opinion stated in the headline. Dogs in public places with a jaw strong enough to harm children should always wear a muzzle. By law.

Here's my explanation:



Dog owners tend to trust their dogs and they trust themselves in knowing their dog's behaviour. 
They expose other people's integrity to their personal, arbitrary judgement call. 
Walking a dog in public, even on a leash, is essentially not different from holding a loaded gun in public without the intention to do harm. 
People would still avoid to be in shooting range. Why do people not shy away from dogs in the same way? 
This is because they've made good experiences with dogs before and therefore underestimate the potential danger by a great margin. People who have been bitten will usually never trust big dogs again and will find that they changed their mind a little too late.
Unmuzzled dogs on sidewalks or in parks are traumatic encounters for victims of dog bites.



There is also the problem of appropiate conviction. 

The guy who purposefully carried a loaded gun in public and then killed someone by slipping his finger is much easier to convict than a dog owner whose only mistake was a short lack of attention for his dog. Should the dog owner be convicted with manslaughter? 
I know I wouldn't be able to lock someone up for this long only because he didn't pay attention. This is because there was no law protecting the dog owner from endangering other people in the first place. The idiot carrying the gun knew he was breaking the law the moment he stepped out the door. The dog owner didn't.



After reading this you probably think that either I've been bitten by a dog or that I'm a dog-hating cat person. I'm neither. 

To be honest I think that muzzles on dogs look very sad and I would rather have a better soultion for all this. However, I have a huge hate for frivolous dog owners who think that because they're not scared of their dog, I shouldn't be either.


So please change my view. :)

Take a look at [this study](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/117/3/e374.short) about dog bites from the Medical University of Graz, Austria. (I know it isn't Germany, but it was the best I could find and I think the analysis will still be applicable.) The incidence rate of dog bites among children (which is your main concern) is 0.5 per 1000, which is very small but still worth analyzing more thoroughly. Well, it's the one year-olds who are at the highest risk of bites, and 82% of the dogs were familiar to the children, i.e. family pets. 

Most one year-olds aren't walking around outside unsupervised, they're with their parents when in public, usually being wheeled around everywhere. And, as the article shows, the risk decreased quickly with age. So requiring muzzles in public to mitigate this very minor risk is a huge overreaction.

Edit: Added details about the study.","I don't think muzzles are a good solution to the problem, honestly. Even if you managed to get something like this enacted, it would **have** to be strictly limited to [basket muzzles](http://www.all-about-cane-corso-dog-breed.com/images/muzzles/Rottweiler-dog-wire-muzzle-Handmade-wwell-ventilated-gearM9-big.jpg) which still allows the dog to bite if someone sticks their fingers into the muzzle (most likely children). And even wire basket muzzles can be dangerous or uncomfortable for the dog. I just don't see how that's justified given that less than 1% of dogs will injure a person while out in public. Especially considering that for many dogs, being out in public at some point during the day is mandatory.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides statistical evidence and analysis from a study conducted in Austria that shows the low incidence rate of dog bites among children. It also highlights that most one year-olds are supervised by their parents in public, reducing the risk even further. This information helps to put the risk of dog bites into perspective and shows that requiring muzzles for all dogs in public may be an overreaction. 

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the limitations and potential drawbacks of implementing muzzles, which may not directly address the original poster's concerns about dog bites in public places. While it is important to consider the welfare of the dogs and the practicality of implementing muzzles, Reply A provides more relevant information that could potentially change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes... we've gone way overboard with this PC/Social Justice mentality.

Recent examples are-

-the furor this morning (at least on twitter) over Amy Schumer in the WaPo. http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/06/dont-believe-her-defenders-amy-schumers-jokes-are-racist/

-Hannibal Burress had a minor run-in with several notable female twitter personalities including Gaby Dunn. https://twitter.com/hannibalburess/status/618179591140564992 (there's a whole list of responses, if it doesn't show up just go through his timeline)

-Jerry Seinfeld made news when he said he wouldn't play college campuses anymore, to much reminding of his relationship with a 17-year old twenty years ago, and snickering over how his material isn't even edgy anyway. http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/10/living/seinfeld-comedy-colleges-feat/

-Chris Rock said the same thing last year. I guess he's a shitlord too. http://www.vulture.com/2014/11/chris-rock-frank-rich-in-conversation.html

-Patton Oswalt, who at one point was booed in Philly for his anti-Bush beliefs back during 2004 or so, is now not worthy of being followed. He's in a category with Trump and Palin. http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/patton-oswalt-twitter-troll-unfollow/

-Not to pick on Gaby Dunn, but earlier this year she blew up at Josh Groban, because I guess young male celebrities being horndogs is completely new and has never, ever happened in human history. https://storify.com/amandataylor88/don-t-fall-for-this-famous-guy-s-flattery

Hell, even amongst the more notable far-left twitter there's infighting. Suey Park and Lauren Chief Elk are going at it over DMs to an ex/stolen laptops https://twitter.com/suey_park/status/617747933987889152

And depending on who you believe, Rania Khalek is anti-black http://bad-dominicana.tumblr.com/post/87992874258/rania-khalek-such-an-antiblack-piece-of-shit-like or ""bad_dominacana"" is racist against Arabs https://twitter.com/raniakhalek/status/514920026236018688.

I was, am and will be a dyed-in-the-patchouli liberal. I was ecstatic that gays can get married now. I will call Caitlyn Jenner whatever SHE wants me to. I'm a big fan of Bernie Sanders. I absolutely believe all fortysomething of Bill Cosby's accusers.
That said, I'm starting to feel a little lost. I cringe when I see the word ""thinkpiece."" I hate that people get so caught up in a perpetual outrage machine and so high off their own self-righteousness they will destroy a life like Justine Sacco's (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html?_r=0) for sport. (Also, how great is Sam Biddle for basically admitting he'd do it all over again for ""the clickz?"") I have to believe that the right or, ""The Man,"" are absolutely loving this infighting. Endless digital ink is spilled on Black Widow in The Avengers while cops are still shooting anyone with a skin tone darker than Burnt Sienna.

Am I wrong? Am I the asshole here? Is all of this of vital importance? Will the 24/7/365 internet analytical news cycle bring us to the promised land? Or is this just a tool of cultural commentators on a deadline?

EDIT:  I'll add this since I'm getting a lot of advice to get off twitter.  I definitely don't go on as much as I used to, but it's hard for me to stay off completely for two reasons.  One, there's a lot of actually good, funny twitterers out there.  It's also a good news source, it's how I found out we got Bin Laden.  Two, as someone who, despite all warning signs, wants to be involved someday in the comedy/entertainment biz, it's kinda necessary for those on the come up to use it as a promotional tool.  If I was Spielberg or Tarantino I'd get the hell off, trust me.  But I'm a nobody from nowhere at the moment.

Try not to focus on the Twitter thing as much.  There's pieces on Gawker, WaPo and Daily Dot that I've used for examples.  Here's a piece on the AVClub where the writer complains about female fans of Captain Marvel for... reasons.  Not sure.  They're problematic somehow.

http://www.avclub.com/article/marvel-learned-wrong-lessons-carol-corps-218003

EDIT 2:  Not sure how much longer this'll stay active, or how much I'll be able to check in tomorrow so I'll do a pseudo-wrap up here.  I used mainly examples from the comedy world and Twitter since that's what immediately came to mind.  Other examples I could've used were Donglegate (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/) and ScientistShirtgate (http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/11/18/scientist-shirt-feminism-comet-your-say/19248543/).  I think those two, and there are others, are also worthy of discussion in that they involve nuance.  Someone like Donald Trump, that's a black-and-white case of racism.  

Someone in the comments said this seemed like neurotic hand-wringing by an alienated individual, and that could very well be the case.  I didn't really spend a whole lot of time making a comprehensive essay about this because a-it's just reddit and b-I posted from the gut with immediacy.  If someone wants to take this theme and do it up better, by all means go for it.  I never claimed to be a social scientist.  Or even just social.

Some good opinions here, with the major consensus being that these things seem big and important on the internet where everything is a hot take and people are either Lawful Good or Chaotic Evil with no in-between.  So in stepping out from the cyberspace will keep the perspective in check.

Good talk everyone!  No name calling or trolling!

I'm not going to argue that the ""PC police"" is inherently good and that the way we're approaching these issues (person said something questionable, ergo, he's a shitlord) isn't somewhat problematic and toxic in the long run, because I believe most of the sites you've linked to are approaching issues in a totally different way than I think would be most helpful. Rather, what I'll argue is something more cynical:

The publishers pushing the ""overboard social justice"" shenanigans you're talking about are doing exactly what they should, because what they're publishing is getting truckloads of clicks more than a nuanced take on the situation. Financially, what they're doing makes total sense.

Look at it this way: Say you've got two articles dealing with remarks made by a Fortune 500 CEO that could easily be construed as sexist. The article from Publication A is a 3,000-word inquiry into the deeper sentiments held behind those remarks, which treats the CEO as a human being with human prejudices (prejudices similar to those that all people hold) and examines why, exactly, those sexist remarks are so hurtful in a deeply nuanced tone which invites deeper critical consideration and doesn't provide an easy emotional response. The article from Publication B is an 800-word evisceration of the CEO as a horrible, unredeemable person representing everything wrong with corporate culture and a beacon of light for slug-headed sexists everywhere. It jumps straight to anger, because it knows it can get its readers angry enough to share the article.

Which do you think will get more clicks, shares, and comments?

Emotion is a powerful force, and many publications are very skilled at manipulating that. I'm white, male, and straight, so I don't have the kind of anger at our society that many minority groups hold. However, many US women are exhausted by the harassment and bigotry they face as a part of the experience of being a woman in the US. Same with people of color, same with LGBTQA+ people, same with non-Christian people (especially Muslims). They're the target audience for many of these pieces - the articles tap into the anger they feel at having to survive as a ""lesser person"" simply because of some part of their identity they can't control. As such, if an article can trigger that kind of strong emotion, the author of the article knows that with a snappy headline and angry enough writing, they can make an article ""worth sharing.""

At some level, I think that the ""PC-ness,"" as you put it, is justified. People want ways to vent their frustration at being oppressed in America while people bluster on about how we're in a post-racial society and such, and these quick, snarky, angry articles are a perfect way to encapsulate that rage (even if that rage might not be the most constructive). There are so many people who are pissed, always at the boiling point because society hasn't let them be anywhere else. However, since they're always at the boiling point, countless publications have figured out the buttons they need to push in order to boil them over the sides of the pot. And, until something changes, that's the best business strategy for most of these publications - whatever gets clicks, you know?

tl;dr - What you're describing isn't super helpful, but, hey, clicks and profit!","&gt;I was, am and will be a dyed-in-the-patchouli liberal. I was ecstatic that gays can get married now. I will call Caitlyn Jenner whatever SHE wants me to. I'm a big fan of Bernie Sanders.*I absolutely believe all fortysomething of Bill Cosby's accusers.*

One of these things is not like the others.  (100% with you on those first four, btw). And herein lies the problem that you're talking about.  *Why* do you believe them, despite having only heresay and no solid evidence to rely on?  

Because you've conflated the idea of their victimhood with your own open-minded liberalness.  You think that to question them would be to reject your *political* beliefs.   That not taking them for their word would betray your principles.   This is an ideological response; and psychologically speaking it is very similar to the reaction religiously devout people have to something that violates the rules of their religion (Such as why so many Christians are mad that gay marriage is now legal).   

In reality, though without doubt it is highly likely that at least *some* of those women are telling the truth, you and I cannot possibly know that, and so to say that you ""absolutely"" believe *all* of them reflects that you *absolutely* do not want anyone to question where you stand on that issue, lest they challenge your ideological purity/sincerity, or worse: Accuse you of being a bigot.  You aren't just a bad person for not sharing their views, You don't share their views *because you're a bad person*.   There are remarkable parallels between the radical left and the religious fundamentalist in this regard.  

That's the problem: It's ideological.   Not rational, not even about what's right or wrong.  Political extremism is about ""US"" vs ""Them"".  And ideological purity is expected by radicals.   Social pressure deters people from questioning, criticizing, or disagreeing.    To suggest that maybe we should wait until we know the facts before judging is tantamount to being a rape apologist and a misogynist to the far-left crowd.    

Then there's the media.   Washington Post, Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, etc.   These publications primarily generate readership by pandering to those extremists.   Washington Post is to Liberalism what Jezebel is to women's equality.   

I won't even get into the tumblr/twitter ""opression olympics""  (as a gay man, I am allowed to have *some* opinions, but they're not as valid as say, a gay *woman*, because she is by virtue of being female more oppressed than me, etc.)  

Ideological extremism ceases to be about justice, or right and wrong, or even the *truth*.   In radical politics, the truth will always be viewed through the funhouse mirror of the ideologue.  

The key is to step back from the labels, and from what you've been *told* to believe, and just start thinking about the foundational goals of social justice.   That everyone should have equal standing under the law, equal opportunities and equal protections within our society.   That the horrors and injustices of history ( and the present day) must be stopped, and the damage done corrected as much as this can possibly be done.     

We have to get away from ideology and indoctrination, and encourage people to use their brains.   Then it will become apparent who really wants a better world, and who is just looking out for their own selfish desires.",A,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B delves into the ideological aspect of the issue at hand and highlights the dangers of blindly following a certain narrative without questioning it. It also encourages critical thinking and stepping away from ideological extremism.

Reply B provides a more nuanced and introspective analysis of the situation, which could prompt the original poster to reconsider their stance."
predict-explain,"I'm not asking anything about why we self harm—trust me I've got many answers for that.  My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is bad, but no one can give me a logical argument for why.

So far this is the logic I've heard again and again:
Self harm is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because you could die, or could get an infection.

The problem I have seen with this is that you can replace ""self harm"" with so many other things and still follow the same basic structure.

Lacrosse is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because you could get a concussion.

Cooking is bad because it is dangerous. You could get burned.

Taking Lithium for Bipolar Disorder is bad because it is dangerous.  It is dangerous because it could give you kidney failure.

So I can not accept the false-logic of dangerous = bad. That means anything dangerous is inherently bad, and that is not true.

It is very easy to self harm without any danger.  Sterilize tools, clean and cover wounds, etcetera.

Of course this can still leave permanent scars, but so can getting a tattoo or a piercing, so once again, self harm isn't inherently bad just because it leaves scars.  Lots of things leave scars, so scars aren't what's bad about it.

Okay, but it's a symptom of a bigger problem.  Yes.  And the bigger problem is the thing that should be fixed.  But that *still* doesn't mean that the symptom is bad.

If you have a bacterial infection, you treat the infection.  You don't just cover any redness up with makeup to treat the symptom.  So self harm, the symptom of many mood disorders, isn't what should be treated.

So besides the ridiculously flawed ""it's dangerous"" argument, explain to me why self harm is inherently bad.

Tl;Dr, something being dangerous doesn't make it bad. Give me a real reason why self harm is bad.

I'd say that because we have evolved to want to *avoid* harm: healthy functioning humans avoid harm; they even avoid the *risk* of harm where that risk is significant.

An individual who transgresses this instinct of avoiding harm is seen as unhealthy, and the act viewed as morally undesirable.

&gt; It is very easy to self harm without any danger. Sterilize tools, clean and cover wounds, etcetera.

This may be true today, but for our entire evolutionary history this was absolutely false. Any and all wounds carried *significant* risk, so we have, as a species and in general, developed an instinctual response to avoid them.

If someone demonstrates that they *lack* that preventitive instinct by cutting themselves there's an immediate cause for moral concern because so much of our socially acceptable behaviour (ie: morality) is tied up in biological instincts: the rational desire to live, empathy, and so on.

Self-harming, even if it effects no one else, *does* call into question someone's mental state and fitness to act in a pro-social way, so I think it's fine for us to want to discourage that kind of behaviour and label it 'bad'.","&gt;The problem I have seen with this is that you can replace ""self harm"" with so many other things and still follow the same basic structure.

These points all do not quite fit the definition of harmful = bad. In all these situations, the activity is done where a risk of harm is present, but the practitioners try to avoid harm.


Self harm is more like an addiction, such as drug abuse or alcohol abuse. Where it is done as a coping mechanism to cover deeper rooted problems within a person, and can quickly become addictive to the point where a person cannot stop themselves from doing in.


Even then, the pain and damage caused by drugs is an unintended consequence. The comedown, the shakes, the liver damage, the collapsed veins and ruined skin.  No body takes methamphetamines because they want to damage their body with them


Self harm is literally your damaging your body, for the sake of damaging your body. Arguably, it is the mental health equivalent of an auto immune disorder, where something has gone wrong and your body damages healthy tissue.",A,B,"I believe that reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a strong argument based on evolutionary biology and human instincts. It explains that self-harm goes against the normal biological impulse to avoid harm, which is deeply ingrained in humans due to our evolutionary history. This argument highlights the moral concern that arises when someone deliberately inflicts harm on themselves, as it goes against our instinctual response to avoid harm. Additionally, the mention of pro-social behavior and mental fitness adds another layer to the argument, emphasizing the negative impact of self-harm on an individual's overall well-being.

On the other hand, reply B compares self-harm to addiction and focuses on the intentional nature of self-harm as damaging one's body for the sake of it. While this argument is valid, it does not delve into the deeper implications of self-harm on a biological and instinctual level, which reply A effectively addresses.

Overall, reply A provides a more comprehensive and compelling argument that is likely to challenge the original poster's perspective on self-harm."
predict-explain,"Disclaimer: this talk of secession may not be present everywhere in the United States, but it is more than prevalent where I live, so I'm going off that.  


To me, secession is crazy talk.  Not only are Southern states often some of the most poor (the poorest being Mississippi), but the United States would have control of the entire military of the United States of America.  That's, well, a lot. 

I talked to someone who believed the South should secede and that ""we"" (the South) would win because ""now [the South] has all the guns and more than half of the major military bases"".  To address this, first of all, it's not as if the military suffers from a chronic lack of arms.  The United States, I'm sure, has ways of attaining weapons that it doesn't already have.  Second of all, it doesn't matter if you have half the major military bases.  First of all, define ""major"".  Second of all, the other side would still have half of them, AND a higher population, AND more money, AND probably the support of many foreign nations (because who would want to side with the South, who would seem like backwoods racists).  The South would crumble, just as it did in the 1860's.  CMV.","The south has half of the major *army* bases, but those are the most mobile and would move if there were tensions.  Air &amp; Naval bases are distributed more evenly, and the nukes are largely in the mountains in the West.  The rest of the country wins by a rather large margin on technical and logistical support.  The South might have a lot of small arms, but it most certainly doesn't have the rest of the country outgunned with the weapons that matter.

But so what?  I think it's a little bit silly to suggest that succession would be met with a bloody all out war again.  We're largely beyond that era.  I'd suspect we, they, and the UN would lean more towards a political division.

A much more important question to the south succeeding is if you think it can be successful economically.  I'd wager the answer is still 'no', but that's probably a more interesting discussion.","There are nukes in the south. No two nuclear nations have ever declared war on each other. If the South seceded and acquired the ability to use the nukes located in the South, there would not be a war.

Now, politically, it might balkanize and collapse as the Soviets did way back in the 20th century, but if (and probably only if) it acquired nuclear capabilities, the US south would probably be recognized as its own nation, unlike the Confederacy.",B,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a more detailed analysis of the military capabilities of the South in the event of secession, highlighting that the South does not necessarily have a significant advantage in terms of weaponry that matters. Additionally, Reply A also brings up the possibility of a political division rather than an all-out war, which could be a more realistic outcome in modern times. On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the potential use of nuclear weapons, which may not be as convincing or relevant to the original poster's concerns about secession."
predict-explain,"Human sentience (or consciousness, or sapience, or whatever term you like) is an emergent behavior of neurons and their interactions, which can be replicated in non-organic systems, i.e., computers. Thus it is likely that given advanced enough technology, we could make a digital human, or even copy an organic human to the digital world.

Similarly, other neural networks can be constructed digitally, collectively known as AI. This is fairly well accepted in modern society, although there are debates over 'souls' and things like that.

I think that sentient AI will probably emerge first, long before we get close to digitizing humans, because of the way AI may emerge. Currently, one approach to developing advanced neural networks is to allow them grow 'naturally', which is to say that the network is given some parameters to optimize, and then iterations darwinistically decide what the optimal solution is. Pretty much like carbon-based evolution, but much faster.

However, I'm not an expert in the field, so I'm open to different opinions, or even alternatives not the above two options. CMV: AI will achieve sentience way before we can make computer humans.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","What you're describing is genetic programming.

Perhaps we will achieve sentience sooner than digitized humans. Doing it through genetic programming has a few issues, however.

Consider consciousness. Have you figured it out? Yes? Good, I'm glad we had this discussion, turn in plans for your Nobel Prize and let the Singularity begin.

No? That's disappointing. Oh well. Consciousness is very complex. How do you test if something has met the parameters for intelligence? Solving intelligent tests? At one point, that test was Chess. We did it, we made computers that were very good at making Chess moves, but they had no idea what Chess was, what it symbolized, what the significance of Chess was, they only knew some numbers tied to some positions. They likely didn't even know what winning or losing meant.

Next, there was the Turing test. Eugene Goostman beat the Turing test, but was still not considered to have our level of consciousness, if any at all. This is because the Turing test is very, very good at determining if you're SIMULATING consciousness. But not if you're actually conscious. Imagine it like school tests. What are they really measuring? How good are you at math or how good are you at getting the answers to the test? You'd think they're the same, but does getting a high math score prove that you know what math is? Why it's significant? Why it's beautiful? Why these equations are important in everyday life? No. A high math score just means you know how to solve the problems on the test.

Then there's the self awareness test, the Tokyo test, etc. We have a history of not having the BEST way to determine consciousness. We're not sure what it is. Maybe consciousness is a spectrum or continuum and we've already solved consciousness, but the AI we're making isn't conscious ENOUGH.

But back to genetic programming, eliminating what doesn't work and letting the best survive. The problem with genetic programming is, let's say you do find a way to test consciousness. It's probably going to involve a LOT of factors, right? Ability to have opinions, ability to change itself, ability to feel, ability to use natural language, ability to create, debate, CMV, etc. Consider the pragmatics.

How long it takes for each AI to see if they pass they test or to even realize they're testing. If you just force them, for all you know, you could just be making an AI that's programmed specifically to do each thing individually without filling in the gaps of consciousness in between. No, you need AIs that do a bunch of those things individually. How long do you leave it alone to see if it does anything before you eliminate the AI? Or do you take up an ungodly amount of resources to keep a bunch of complex computers the size of warehouses around, possibly taking up miles?

And you're doing this with each iteration. It could take forever.

Then, consider the ethics. Killing an AI because it's not ""good enough?"" Sound familiar to anyone? Are we allowed to do that because they're subhuman or something? That's another consideration. Is it okay to have an AI thrown into a test it knows nothing about only to kill it before it has a chance to have a quality life? In all likelihood, because of the randomness of their iterations, most of the AIs will be insane if they do become sentient and they'll suffer. They'll suffer real bad.

So, genetic programming, in my non-expert opinion, is not a good approach to conscious AI. Feel free to CMV.","What is happening inside neural networks isn't that different from what is happening inside your brain. Connections are constantly made and destroyed based on input, trying to optimize how certain task is performed. Optimizing a neural network is more similar to ""learning"" rather than ""evolving a brain"". How intelligent a neural network can become is limited by its design. If I build a neural network, it will never become intelligent, even if I let it run for years. Just like you can train a raccoon for years but it will never become smarter than a raccoon. You will never get a point where sentient AI will ""emerge spontaneously"". We will have to create it ourselves. Our systems will become better and smarter with each design iteration, until one day they are good enough to be indistinguishable from what we call ""intelligence"".

At the end of the day simulating a brain requires little understanding of how it works, but needs A LOT of computational power. Even simulating realistically a couple of neurons takes supercomputers. Building something intelligent from the ground up will be more efficient, but then you need to know precisely how to create such a system (i.e. deep understanding of intelligence and sentience).

The question which will happen first depends on how fast each field is advancing. If it turns out we are better at making faster computers and intelligence is extremely complex, then simulation will be first. If we turn out to be good at understanding how brains work, we might create AI before the tech simulating brains is available. Saying one will happen for certain is premature. After all, computers double in computational speeds every 18 months. Our understanding of brains and intelligence grows slower than that. There is a chance simulation will be first.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A raises valid concerns about the complexities of achieving true sentience in AI through genetic programming. It highlights the challenges in defining and testing consciousness, as well as the ethical considerations involved in creating and potentially discarding sentient AI. These points make a strong case for why creating sentient AI through genetic programming may not be as straightforward or feasible as initially thought.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the technical aspects of simulating brains and building intelligent systems. While it provides some interesting insights into the differences between neural networks and biological brains, it doesn't address the practical challenges and ethical dilemmas that Reply A brings up. Additionally, Reply B seems to lean more towards the idea that creating AI from the ground up may be more efficient, but it doesn't delve into the potential roadblocks or uncertainties in achieving this.

Overall, Reply A's comprehensive examination of the issues surrounding genetic programming for sentient AI makes it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"Having played dota for 1 year, and Lol for 6 months before that i have come to the opinion that Dota 2 is a much better game in many facets. Not only is dota 2 completely free to play, the actual gameplay is better, and the graphics are much better.


-The Dota 2 map is larger and has more interesting features for vision and juking.


-Dota 2 has TP scrolls and a courier allowing for more interesting map movement.


-Dota 2 heroes have much more unique and scaled up abillities than LoL Champions.  Think techies vs teemo, and heroes like tinker, meepo, lone druid, invoker, etc.  LoL heroes typically have a couple skillshot nukes and a movement abillity as a rule of thumb.


-Denying, highground miss chance, and pulling/stacking make laning much more interesting in Dota.


-Ancients and Roshan are much more interesting high value targets than Dragon or Baron.


-Towers are much weaker in Dota, and smoke of deceit exists, allowing for much more aggressive gameplay.


-Dota heros are much more turbocharged, any dota hero ported exactly would be the strongest champion in League of Legends.


-Activatable items improve gameplay decisionmaking.  LoL items are boring and mostly just stat based.  Dota items allow for much more customizablility in item build and improvement in game play (blink dagger 18 second cooldown vs. flash 300 second cooldown).


Dota 2 has a higher barrier of entry in a style of game whose focus is improvement, and that might lead people to LoL, but given the massive time investment in either game this is basically irrelevent.

The superior game offers more meaningful options to a player at all periods of the game. A false option, a calculation or a forgone outcome are not fun.

DotA2 is a strategic game. Everything you do has weight, but you do not get to do much. For example, hero choice is a big choice, but once made, you do not get to do anything about lane matchup, thats a forgone conclusion of the matchup. Your powercurve has been decided. Fights have long CC, and many targeted abilities: You will get hit with stuff, and the timing of these big things is strategic, but really, there is no choices.

LoL is tactical. Most things you do have little weight but there are many options. Almost any hero is playable into any other hero. Builds allow many different options and power curves. Fights are fluid and skillful with skillshots to dodge and many decisions as to targets and timing of spell use.

I can take your points one by one and show you how this works:

1. The map is larger with less vision to make your choice where to go a more impactful one, but the longer distance means you cannot make destination choices often or you will lose time. LoL's smaller map means your position is more tactical, and allows people to redeploy faster.

2. Courier attacks are highly strategic, but leave players with no choices. LoL's recalls give lots of choices, and while most of them only lead to a small gold advantage gained, good players can abuse recall timing to get significantly more farm.

3. You have bigger skills and more unique heroes, which means choice is strategic, but it also means that what you do in fights has been predetermined and you only have a calculation of who to click on to do. Champions with more closely related skill push both players to try attain their perfect play, while denying the opponent something similar, many more tactical choices.

4. The laning mechanics are literally tacked on because without them it would be dull. Heroes have strategic spell casts with massive mana costs, meaning you can make big decisions very infreqently. Thus, to fill time and stop bored players, denying and miss had to be added. LoL lets you cast often, and while each cast is less impactful, it leads to many tactical choices in lane, with spell harass and use being the main point.

5. Roshan is definately a boring objective, granting nothing more than gold and a extra life. Anchient camps are even worse, they only give gold. Dragon gives a stacking buff which forces people to consider the value of each dragon in the context of the unlocked lategame buff. Baron gives a buff which basically makes it impossible to defend against sieges by empowering minions, much more interesting.

6. While DotA heroes are very strong, they are very perscriptive in how they have to be played, offering few choices to the player and even fewer in a matchup. By having more similar champions, interactions are more even and offer many more choices.

7. Active items are simply one extra calculation: ""When is it best for me to use this"" with there being a single best time. Cooldowns are not long enough to make this a unclear decision, and so, in both games, they simply form another button to press.

DotA2 is a harder game, because you must have massive strategic knowledge to play it at any level. You must know matchups, power curves etc etc due to the few choices you can make having high impact. LoL is a easier to start game, as you have many choices to make, which do not have individual large impact. The tactical nature limits the required information starting out, allowing people to  grasp it easily.

DotA2 is not a bad game, rather it is simply a complex game with many mechanics which require a deep knowledge and for this reason it can be said to limit the choices a player can make and this is something a lot of people dislike, leading to the playerbase discrepancy.

LoL is simply superior, more people play it, and the game actively encourages making meaningful choices, the crucial fun in a game.","As someone with 3k+ games of League under his belt and three years of DotA Allstars experience, I think you can pretty easily narrow down your argument to ""complex games are better"". 

But that's not true in all situations, and my current circle of gaming friends is a perfect example. Not one out or the ten of them us willing to even touch DotA because of its complexity, primarily because they're really not good at video games. 

For people who enjoy difficult games with high skill ceilings, DotA is certainly superior - but your claim is missing that bit of context, because not everyone enjoys difficult games, and not everyone aspires to have a high skill level. 

That last part in particular is a point I'm personally trying to come to grips with, but it's apparently the primary mode my friends have - they just want to play to have fun, not to get good; and at all opportunities they will choose having fun over being good. Thus, league is perfect for them - nanda DotA is nothing short of cancer. 


And yes, I die a little every day due to being surrounded by casuals.",B,A,"I would say Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a detailed breakdown of each point made by the original poster and offers a counterargument with reasoning behind why LoL may be superior in those aspects. It also acknowledges the complexity of Dota 2 but argues that the tactical nature of LoL can also be enjoyable for players. 

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the idea that not everyone enjoys difficult games and that some players prefer to have fun over being good at a game. While this is a valid point, it doesn't directly address the specific points made by the original poster about the gameplay mechanics and features of Dota 2 versus LoL.

Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to tease out meaning. Many other amendments overlap in meaning and could be combined to simplify them while also covering more people. The fact is, it is outdated.

I believe it should be revised every 100 years or so because culture and language are organic. They change based on technology, public conscious, and international relations. Should we follow the advice of a group who believed slavery was acceptable? That thought only white, male, property owners should/could vote? Can you read through the document and understand what was meant or does much of it come across as confusing to todays readers? The world has changed and I believe we need to change with it in order to be relevant. I also believe our ideas and views from today will experience the same degradation over time. In 100 years will the world still care about gun rights? Will the population still speak mostly english or will we add more spanish to our vocabulary? Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had? We cannot know. We should not force our ideas through time, expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers.

What I can't understand is why we are clinging to the past, to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today. We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs. We should update, revise, and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are. I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either. I am saying we should interpret it for today, update it, and use our revised version instead. Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed. It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws. It would take a lot of work, a lot would change, but I believe we would be better for it. CMV

---Edit---
Many responses seem to think I am saying scrap the whole thing and start over. No, I am saying we need an updated, reworded one that uses the meanings as we take them today. All men are equal shoule read all persons, prohibition and its repeal should just be removed, the 15th and 19th should be combined and all inclusive with restrictions put in after the fact. Those are examples of what I mean but not the whole of it.

To CMV you need to show me that having an old, poorly worded document is better than a revision of it in modern terms. It would be hard to do but it would be better for the nation and easier to work with than if we left it be. CMV

There's no point in combining or re-writing amendments. The constitution (especially the Bill of Rights) is not something that needs to be changed and should be kept alone. They were written for a reason. The only amendment in the Bill of Rights that some people have a problem with is mostly the 2nd, but that's only because they're ignorant of what the 2nd amendment was written for in the first place. What you could do is try to translate the constitution into a more understandable text for people who aren't really savvy with that sort of thing, but that's already done by not only the courts, but many other people. I'd also like to ask, what exactly would you want to update and or change in the constitution specifically other than the wording of certain things?","I am not going to argue that you make some really good points, and in theory I agree with you.  But, can you imagine what revising the Constitution would look like?  The 2nd amendment fight would be brutal.  You would have constitutional guarantees for gun (and more than guns) being balanced between New York City and rural Minnesota.  How do you find common ground?  If you somehow do, how do you get the votes to pass it?  How about the 1st amendment?  What does free speech mean now?  How about religion?  I could go on, but most of the amendments would have people trying to redefine them, and I don't see enough common ground to get any of it done.

And there is more!  How about delineating the powers of the branches of government?  Generally, we would probably want something more specific, but what would it look like?  How about the specifically delineated powers of the federal government?  What are the new ones?  It is a very anachronistic list, but what to replace it with? The electoral college?  Probably should be scrapped as one of the first things to do, but with what?  

Most importantly, who is going to lead this process?  We had some amazing men and leaders trying to figure this out, and they still struggled.  And no twitter.  No 24 hour news media picking everything apart.  Who are today's great men who will lead us through the painful process?  Name 5 people who both liberals and conservatives would trust to make this happen.  Can you get there?  How about to 10?  I think we could find them, really.  I would have to look outside of Washington to do it, though.  And I would have to find people without the visibility to get through the process.  Instead, it would most likely be made up of current and retired high visibility politicians, and how do you feel about them.  Not to mention, the whole method of selecting a team would probably be a deal breaking process in the first place.  

So, I agree with you.  There is just no way to get it done.",B,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B brings up practical challenges and complexities that would come with revising the constitution, such as the difficulty in finding common ground on contentious issues like the 2nd amendment and free speech. Additionally, the logistical challenges of finding trustworthy leaders to lead the revision process and the potential for high visibility politicians to dominate the process are also highlighted. These points make it clear that revising the constitution is not a straightforward task and would involve significant obstacles. Overall, Reply B provides a more comprehensive and realistic assessment of the challenges involved in revising the constitution, which could potentially influence the original poster's perspective."
predict-explain,"I'll start off by saying I'm a vegetarian and I also try to limit the eggs and dairy I eat, I try to buy no leather and no other animal byproducts. When there are leftovers from dinners with guests, etc. I'll eat that (throwing meat away is definitely worse than eating it). I try to do as much as I can for the environment and animals, I have very little money so I do not donate to animal rights organizations but I certainly would if I could.

I'm trying to be as reasonable as possible on the subject, I try not to see individuals as evil 'cause they think it's normal to torture animals, I understand it's a cultural thing although I loathe humanity in general.

I also think the hypothetical contribution of even a billion of the strictest vegans imaginable wouldn't change things a bit.

As of today I'm making this choice exclusively because it makes me feel good / at peace with myself, 'cause if I think about the contribution to the environment, I'm sorry but I just can't believe I'm doing anything significant.

I'm 100% convinced on what I've done for a year now, and I'll become as ""vegan"" as possible in the future (I hate this whole ""vegan"" thing, it should be something natural like being against slavery), I'm NOT looking for an excuse to quit. But I know it'll only benefit my ethics and my self-esteem.

I know that for every person like me (and I'm nowhere near good) there are one thousand who don't give a damn. I know that there are TENS OF BILLIONS animals being tortured for food, and unless the world miraculously turns vegan overnight, there's no chance any of this will change. Change my view.

On the eating leftovers thing, I also have to add.. I've been to a wedding recently and I got vegetarian courses, it was really no hassle for anyone... but I looked at the courses with fish and meat and I just thought of all the stuff they'd be throwing away that day... if I ate meat and fish that day it would have made NO difference at all... maybe it would have been better, saved the cook some work...

For me the key point is not BUYING meat rather than not eating it, I get it, and having vegetarian stuff served that day and making things look positive for everyone and having conversations with others about being vegetarian was a positive thing... but the actual contribution to things? That restaurant probably threw away ten times what I could have eaten. It's depressing.

I still recommend that people switch to a vegetarian (or vegan) lifestyle, I think it's a GOOD thing by all means. It's a fantastic feeling, it's healthy, and a million other things. As I said I haven't stopped believing in the lifestyle and I'll never quit. I just believe the actual contribution to the environment and the well being of animals is insignificant, and expecting results is hopeless.

**I have found a convincing argument and I think that made me change my mind. Although many answers were backed up by very uplifting data, I couldn't justify changing my mind since I couldn't help but believe things are changing way too slowly, and that the damage might still be irreparable in the long run.**

&gt; Eventually — not soon, but maybe in a generation or two — I would not be surprised if the majority of people on the liberal side of the fence started to shun meat-eating, as has happened with social issues in recent years. And at that point, changes will be sweeping and sudden.

I have never thought about critical mass. I still believe the situation is a lot more complex than just the West, but even believing that one day a relatively sudden change could happen like it did with LGBT rights based on public opinion reaching critical mass makes me believe there's something to look for behind the hard numbers.

The growing number of people with vegetarian/vegan friends and family members also means that more people are being exposed to delicious vegetarian/vegan food and even learning how to cook it, all of which chips away at the all-too-common notion that any meal without meat isn't worth eating.

Helping society at large reduce its meat consumption is really important because meat production has such an enormous environmental impact, especially with regard to climate change. The exact contribution of animal agriculture to climate change is disputed, but the most widely accepted statistics seem to put animal agriculture at about 15-25% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, with some estimates reaching as high as nearly 50%. While it certainly is possible to raise meat in a sustainable and environmentally healthy way, in practice 78% of beef, 95% of pork, and 99% of chicken is raised in factory farms, so getting people to eat less meat overall is very important. Even a 10% reduction in overall meat consumption could make a significant difference. According to the Earth Day Network, if everybody in the U.S. did not eat meat or cheese for just one day a week, it would be the equivalent of not driving 91 billion miles. (I'm not sure how that figure was calculated, but if it's even close to correct, it demonstrates the kind of difference skipping meat just three meals a week could make.)","In short, the reality is: It adds up.

The number of animals produced and slaughtered is so high that the very small probability of you sparing an animal from it still translates to 50-100 animals per year. And in my opinion, that's significant.

Think of it this way: If the odds of you saving one animal are the same as the odds of you winning the lottery (say, one in 200 million), being a vegetarian is like entering that lottery a billion times.",B,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides more specific and concrete examples of how an individual's actions can have a measurable impact on meat production. By breaking down the process of how purchasing a product can lead to further demand and ultimately more animals being slaughtered, reply B illustrates the potential ripple effect of one's choices. Additionally, the comparison of saving one animal to winning the lottery multiple times helps put into perspective the significance of individual actions in the larger context of animal welfare.

On the other hand, reply A focuses more on the societal impact of vegetarianism/veganism and the environmental benefits of reducing meat consumption. While these points are important, they may not directly address the original poster's concerns about the perceived insignificance of their individual actions.

Overall, reply B's emphasis on the potential impact of even small actions and the use of statistics to support its argument make it more likely to sway the original poster's view on the matter."
predict-explain,"When I see debate about 'the big issues' (stuff like climate change, or gun rights, or public healthcare policy) people don't seem to particularly care about 'evidence'. If they shift on these issues, its for emotional reasons. 

Sure they'll have a few go-to facts or stats that are essentially cherry picked to support their view, or they may even be aware of the news, etc,(again to find info to support their position) but new evidence rarely changes people's minds.

If people did have beliefs based on evidence there'd be a greater diversity in the beliefs individuals held. As it is, if I know a person cares about climate change, odds are they are anti-gun rights and pro-choice. If they're big on border protection, they're gonna be small government and pro-gun rights. These are largely unrelated topics, yet at least 80% of the time people hold these 'suites' of ideas.

People seldom shift on these big issues, because views aren't evidence based, they're ideological. The few times people do change its because of one of two reasons.

An overall change in societal norms on the issue. Same sex marriage is a good example of this. This wasn't even on the agenda 20 years ago. There has been little 'data' to change peoples minds; we've just had a kind of cultural shift, and now its broadly accepted. It wasn't data or evidence that changed people's minds, it was a change in societies norms.

The other thing which I believe *can* change folks' minds is personal experience/change. I've known people to retire, or have  a health crisis, which shakes up their whole outlook, including views on ''the big issues. Or perhaps a personal brush with an issue-""My son came out, now I'm pro-same sex marriage""

So persuade me people are actually rational, and can be convinced by actual facts-CMV

[EDIT]:  To clarify I mean objective evidence(data, stats, facts), as opposed to emotive appeal(personal anecdotes/experience.  I'm sure there's some grey area, but that's the general idea)

[""evidence"" in this context means objective stats or data, and doesn't include personal experience, or one emotionally affecting news event(e.g ""Sandy Hook really got to me, now I'm anti-guns"") ]","Are your set of ""big issues"" specifically ""issues that are controversial/unresolved in 2015"", and your set of evidence specifically ""evidence that is available in 2015""?  Because if so, you might imagine that the reason the issue is unresolved is because the fact pattern can be interpreted at least two ways.

How about some previous large issues?  

*Evolution  (evidence resolved via science)

*Empiricism vs innate knowledge (evidence resolved via science)

*Heliocentric astronomy (evidence resolved via science)

*Prohibition (evidence resolved via a grand societal experiment)

I would disagree with your characterization of same sex marriage attitudes.  What happened was that the gay community made a conscious effort to encourage one another to ""come out"".  People suddenly had many more data points, and were thus able to generalize from something approximating [actual set of gay people] instead of from the very-skewed sample they'd previously known about.  They hadn't previously known that gay people were so normal because the normal gay people were mostly closeted.","This varies a lot based on what type of issue you are talking about.

I'm surprised you used climate change to support your view - to me climate change is a clear example of evidence *clearly* driving people's views.  The climate change ""debate"" is politicians arguing over science, but the issue itself is a matter of scientists, and among credible scientists there isn't really a ""debate"" because the evidence all points solidly in one direction.  The arguments against climate change come largely from corporate interests and the politicians and ""scientists"" bought by corporate interests.  In other words, the scientific community largely agrees (based on the evidence) that climate change is a major challenge, and some politicians (who are not experts in climate science) have accused the entire scientific community of pulling some sort of scheme.  One side is motivated by desire to uncover the truth through experimentation and research (scientists) and the other is motivated by money from sponsors (politicians).",A,A,"I would say reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a specific example of climate change where evidence does drive people's views, highlighting the clear consensus among credible scientists and the influence of corporate interests on the opposing side. This directly challenges the original poster's assertion that evidence rarely changes people's minds on big issues. Reply A, while providing historical examples of evidence resolving issues, does not directly address the original poster's argument about the lack of evidence-based beliefs in contemporary debates. Therefore, reply B is more likely to persuade the original poster to reconsider their viewpoint."
predict-explain,"Over the last few years, and especially now with the popularity of Bernie Sanders, a heavily debated subject is the raising of the minimum wage to $15/hour. While many would expect this to strengthen the lower class and only decreasing the wealth of the upper class, I feel as if it would end up hurting those it is meant to help.   
  
These company's would now have to spend much more of their budget on paying employees, and it's not as if they're going to magically have more money. I understand that the increase of wealth in the lower class would eventually circulate back to the business's, but I highly doubt it would be enough to make up for the increased wages of their employees, and it definitely wouldn't happen right away. Since I highly doubt the CEO or other upper management would take cuts from their pay to make up for this, that leaves two possible solutions that I can see: 
  
The first would be to decrease the amount of employees. If approximately an equal percentage of employees are let go to the increase in pay the company will be able to function without upper management having to take a pay cut. While those who are able to keep there jobs would be greatly helped by this, for the most part it would just increase the unemployment rate; with these lay offs happening in a large portion of minimum wag paying company's there would be no demand for jobs while the supply would be sky rocketing. 
  
The other solution would be for the company to increase prices (for retail/restaurants). With increasing prices nobody would have to loose their job, however it would still end up hurting the lower class. Practically all people get there basic necessities and luxuries from retail and grocery stores- the lower and middle classes especially rely heavily on major stores such as Walmart or Target. Even if your paycheck is increasing you'd still end up paying more the things you already buy, taking a large chunk of your paycheck. 
  
While ideally an increased minimum wage seems perfect, it would in reality end up creating a combination of these two things. I'm sure I didn't hit on some points, so please try to change my view on this, I, as a minimum wage employee myself, would love to have a good reason to support raising it.

EDIT: ∆ Okay, my views been changed. I still don't think something as drastic as upping it to $15/hour right away would be a good idea, but I think a gradual increase could be really good. The biggest things that helped my view change were the historical instances of MW rising, the average proportion of price increase vs. wage increase, as well as the fact that businesses are already operating with the minimum number of employees and that jobs wouldn't just become expendable. I really wish I could reply to more comments but I can't at the moment, thanks to everybody who replied!","&gt;Even if your paycheck is increasing you'd still end up paying more the things you already buy, taking a large chunk of your paycheck.

The current price of goods is where it is with everyone making Minimum wage AND ABOVE.

Not everyone will have their wages increased. So where someone making $7.55 has their wages increased 100%, the price of goods would not increase 100% as well, because not 100% of people had their wages increased.

We also have to factor in that with these people having an increase in buying power. At $7.55, you barley have a disposable income. Increase that and their spending power increases. This would increase the profits of the stores that had to increase their salary budgets. It would essentially offset it.","I've had this debate many times on reddit, and typically the same arguments are made against raising the minimum wage. You've fallen into the same thinking patterns. I'll post an older response I've made to similar arguments if that's ok.


&gt; Reading through these comments I have read the same complaints about raising the minimum wage Ad nauseam. Here are some points I would like you all to consider. I'll go point by point.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1.Raising the minimum wage will mean that less people will have jobs.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Possibly. But this is not the case for MOST businesses. Businesses already employ as few people as the possibly can. Remember, every job is an expense..a cost...something they attempt to eliminate any chance they get(this is not meant to be a slight at businesses...it is the smartest way to do business and I would do the same if I was in charge).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Raising the minimum wage wouldn't mean that businesses would just start firing people left and right because all of a sudden they cant make money. Think of it this way. If Mcdonald's all of a sudden had to pay the guy who does the fries 9$ instead of 7.25...would they fire the french fries guy? Of course not. They NEED him.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **TLDR : Businesses already attempt to eliminate jobs whenever possible. Companies may attempt to rid themselves of a few minimum wage workers, but the vast majority of the jobs are much more difficult to eliminate.**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 2 .Prices are all going to go up to counteract the increase in cost of production.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Possibly. But there's a lot people are missing here. First we need to discuss how a business will deal with an increase in costs. There are two areas the money can come from. Either the customer must pay more money for your good, or the company must accept a lower profit margin for each good they sell(99% of the time it is a combination of both). How much that gets passed to the customer is determined by price elasticity...which is pretty much how much the demand of a good will decrease if you raise the price
&gt; (Example : Starbucks is WAY more elastic that diabetes medication..you cant exactly walk away from your insulin shots if the price goes up.)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Now.. will prices rise for all of us if minimum wage goes up? Possibly. We need to consider a few things first:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; A) Price stickiness and Price elasticity. Some goods and services simply cannot go up sharply in price much even if the cost goes up to make the good. The goods you most commonly buy have a higher elasticity and probably wont go up all that much.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; B) Increase in demand. While companies may make less of a profit margin..they will sell MORE in the aggregate. Since minimum wage workers spend almost 100% of what they make, the money goes back into the businesses almost immediately and the money circulates. This is golden for a consumer based economy(thats us btw).
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; C) Not every single good produced in America uses a ton of minimum wage labor. This one is pretty much common sense. If your business doesn't employ much minimum wage labor, your costs won't increase much.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; D) Lastly, lets consider that our minimum wage adjusted for inflation(1996 base) is about 4.97.
&gt; It was its highest in the year 1968, at 7.21. Remember, the 1950s and 1960s was the longest period of economic growth and prosperity in the nations history. I'm not suggesting that this is due to the minimum wage, but this fact makes short work of the idea that the minimum wage going up will lead to economic meltdown..
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I may edit this later as I am sure there are points that I have left out. But lets get down to whether or not it is a good idea to have a minimum wage..and whether or not it should be increased.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In order to answer this question, we only need to ask if the benefits of having a higher minimum wage are worth the costs we must incur. To me it is an obvious yes. Minimum wage workers will have more spending power, and the economy will be stronger overall. Henry Ford said it best in my opinion. ""I pay my workers more so they have enough money to buy my cars!""
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Also, don't believe the hype when businesses say that it will kill their business if they have to pay workers 9 bucks. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. that low wage workers try to get ANYTHING businesses will say this.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted 8 hour workdays
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted lunch breaks
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted weekends off
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted vacations
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when workers wanted safe working conditions
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when they would have to pay everyone the same regardless of race or gender
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They said it when it came to workers wanting to unionize
&gt; I could go on all day. A healthy minimum wage wont cripple businesses any more than the rest of these things did.",B,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a thorough and well-structured argument that addresses the concerns raised by the original poster in a logical and informative manner. It breaks down the potential impacts of raising the minimum wage on businesses, prices, and the economy as a whole, and provides historical context to support the argument. Additionally, Reply B effectively counters common arguments against raising the minimum wage and highlights the potential benefits of increasing it. Overall, Reply B presents a strong case for raising the minimum wage and is more likely to change the original poster's view by providing compelling reasons to support the idea."
predict-explain,"Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all. There are other sources of information that help us grow much better.

If that is so, what is the point of fiction apart from a source of entertainment that may or may not help us in the long run? If all it does is provide short-term joy, what is the point of it?

Is our time not better spent trying to grow ourselves?   
Why waste our time trying to entertain ourselves when we could just use other forms of relaxation between sessions of growing ourselves? Is that not the goal of life? To improve and advance our lives and those of others?

Or am I wrong? Is fiction truly of some use? Or if it isn't of any use, then should we still consume it? If so, why? Why not simply just exercise, meditate or sleep instead of reading fiction? What makes fiction a better alternative to those activities?","&gt; Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all.

That is unequivocally false. Fiction can be entertaining but its value comes from its ability to help the reader (watcher, listener &amp;c.) grow. Good art will express something the consumer already feels or knows but is unable to describe (how *Hannibal* treats and presents the beautiful and grotesque identically), or force on to the consumer an experience or point-of-view alien to them (like the post-war dissatisfaction and purposelessness of WWI vets as presented in *The Sun Also Rises*), or explore an aspect of life in an allegorical way to highlight certain aspects of it (like how *Alien* is one big giant rape metaphor). All these things can be done in exciting ways but the goal is not excitement. 

These things contribute to the personal growth of the consumer in ways dry non-fiction or unaided introspection cannot. It's one thing to read about Russia's 19th century identity crisis, but another thing entirely to anthropomorphize it and view ideology on such a personal scale (The Brothers Karamazov). It's one thing to think about how charming people can get away with horrible things, but another thing entirely to be drawn in yourself without even realizing it (Lolita). It's one thing to read ""people usually prefer independence to dependence even when there are costs associated with the former"", but another thing entirely to read:

*Here at least*

*we shall be free; the Almighty hath not built*

*Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:*

*Here we may reign secure, and in my choice*

*to reign is worth ambition though in Hell:*

*Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven.*","&gt; Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all.

I think you should define what you mean by ""growing"" here. Do you mean a specific kind of development? If yes, in what direction? What skills should we develop or what form of progress should we pursue instead of enjoying entertainment media?

&gt; Why waste our time trying to entertain ourselves when we could just use other forms of relaxation between sessions of growing ourselves?

Such as? Isn't every form of relaxation ""entertainment"" by definiton?

&gt; Is fiction truly of some use?

I would argue yes: Fiction, despite being fictional, can still be as useful for intellectual stimulation as traditional education. Here are some examples: 

 * Video games like ""This War of mine"" try to offer a perspective of struggling civilians in a war-torn country for those lacking first-hand experience of war.

 * The novel ""Animal Farm"" can convey a basic understanding of political and sociolgical development of capitalistic societies into autocratic dictatorships.

 * Reading classical German poetry, like the famous works of Goethe, can complement a historical education about Central Europe in the 18th and 19th century, as well as giving insight into moral and cultural ideas prevalent during that time. 

As I tried to point out, the distinction between ""waste of time"" and ""effective use of time"" isn't that clearly cut.",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides specific examples and explanations of how fiction can help with personal growth and development. It highlights the unique ways in which fiction can offer insights and perspectives that non-fiction or other forms of relaxation cannot. It also emphasizes the deeper emotional and intellectual impact that fiction can have on individuals. Reply A effectively challenges the original poster's notion that fiction is solely for entertainment and lacks value in personal growth, making it more persuasive in changing their view."
predict-explain,"I am a young black male, who is torn between both sides of the aisle regarding race relations in America. 

I have experience racial profiling and understand that there is a prevalent problem with minorities -- specifically African-Americans and Latinos receiving lengthier prison sentences and disproportionately being targeted by law officials. 

I also understand that my experiences do not relate to all of the black community. By that I mean, just because I was able to make it out of the 'hood' doesn't necessarily mean every black person is awarded that opportunity. 


However I also believe that police brutality should not be the pressing issue within the (urban) black community. I believe that the black community is a ''riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma''. And that movements like Black Lives Matter only polarize the country. The American consciousness does not change overnight. 

Obviously I'm not going to be able to go into deep analysis of my views but I'll try touch on some view points.

* Mindset









Black people throughout American history have been disproportionately impoverished, and throughout the last 30 years have developed a mindset of ""hustlin"". Now I understand that ""hustlin"" can translate into any race/culture as just another medium in which to get money. But black culture seems to value poverty and the 'hustlers mentality'. If I turn on the radio to HOT107.5, I am very likely to find the radio announcer perpetuating this stereotype. ""Hustlin'""  is glorified while education is not. 

There is very little initiative towards the Arts, STEM, etc. Sports/athleticism seems to be the major avenue to which black people feel they can ascend from poverty. 

Hip-hop is attached to black culture, and it seems that black culture (which has churned out great literary works and ideas) cannot distance itself from hip-hop. I don't believe hip-hop is bad. Quiet the opposite, but it is the black community that has embraced the hip-hop scene and made the world associate it with us &amp; crime/street life. Even TV shows portray this, everything from sitcoms to drama. You are less likely to find the token-black guy, and more likely to find the 'reformed thug'. 

Black people want to be included in mainstream society, yet reject it at the same time. We want to have black casts in popular TV series or movie franchises, but we also want black-only things. I believe you can't have your cake and eat it too. America works best as a soup, not a salad. 

The black community has yet to tackle black on black crime, yet it sees police brutality as more important. We HATE to be labeled as thugs, criminals, yet social media has only made our stereotypes more transparent.

/r/blackpeopletwitter, albeit funny, is also embarrassing because black people are again perpetuating a stereotype or being cast a stereotype. Tweets about is 'how fire is my mixtape, 'bruh' 'nigga this, nigga that'. We have normalized it to the point weere teenage white girls are saying ""nigga"" and ""bitch"" like it's a pronoun. Political action by black tweeters seems to also alienate other groups of people. The issue of police brutality for example seems to be marketed/targeted as a black-only issue. Again, creating polarizing opinions/slogans like ""All Lives Matter"" 


* Black nationalism

In my eyes, black nationalism is dangerous because it perpetuates a lot of misinformation and half truths. It is on the scale as 'white washing' history. Social media has become a breeding ground for misinformation by/for the black community. Black nationalism will ultimately lead to polarizing the nation.

i.e. ""Ancient Egyptians were black, Jesus was black, Mohammed was black, etc"" or teaching talking about slavery only in terms of black v. white. 


* Homophobia/Racism/Misogyny

As I stated earlier, the black community hasn't made a very active attempt in stemming the mindset that mainstream hip-hop culture perpetuates. All I can tell you is from my own experience but homophobia and misogyny  seems to be rampant in the black community. Not so much in terms of violent actions but insults through social media and subtle homophobic/misogynistic remarks made on radio and TV.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","I think your analysis failed to address the historical roots of your points. You don't address where the stereotypes originated, you don't discuss the long term generational effects poverty and mass incarceration have on communities, and you fail to realize how social media has allowed for the dissemination of information on issues black communities face to non-black communities. 

&gt;""Hustlin'"" is glorified while education is not.

Well, this is what happens when you have an education system that has time and time again failed black communities in urban areas. I highly recommend listening to [this](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) episode of This American Life. It touches on the huge discrepancies between the education white kids receive and black kids receive in St. Louis but it's just one example that can be applied to urban communities across the country. 

 &gt;However I also believe that police brutality should not be the pressing issue within the (urban) black community. I believe that the black community is a ''riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma''. And that movements like Black Lives Matter only polarize the country. The American consciousness does not change overnight.

Police brutality is another example of how a system that is meant to protect people fails to protect black communities. I don't understand why you think it's not important to address. Mike Brown's case is not only a case of a white cop killing a black boy, but an example of economic and social disparities in white and black neighborhoods. Black Lives Matters isn't about polarizing the country. Why should this issue even be polarizing? That's the main problem. Why are people still arguing that systemic racism isn't an issue in this country? That's what BLM protestors are trying to move away from - we aren't arguing anymore that race is a problem in this country, right now we're trying to address the problems of the institutions in this country. And to be honest it is working. After the two BLM protestors shut down Bernie Sander's event what happened? He released his platform on racial justice and has talked about mass incarnations and the issues of private prisons in this country. 

I think you barely grazed the surface with your analysis. It's important to look into the psychological effects systemic racism has on communities. Black communities don't trust the very institutions you think we should trust (education, police force, etc). Saying black communities should cooperate and let go of very important aspects of our culture (hip-hop, music, sports) is in and of itself oppressive. Black people in this country were never given the power to address these issues for themselves, they weren't even considered people since the day they were brought to this country, because of this we have to rely on our communities to fight for ourselves and make these issues more heard. [Here's](http://www.thenation.com/article/black-lives-matter-is-a-demand-not-a-plea/) a piece that highlights why that is important.","Wow, there is a lot to respond to here.  I'll start out by tackling it point by point.

&gt; There is very little initiative towards the Arts, STEM, etc. Sports/athleticism seems to be the major avenue to which black people feel they can ascend from poverty.

First off, sports are actually one of the more genuinely meritocratic institutions in this country.  Although realistically most black people will never become professional athletes, sports in school often come with requirements to maintain a certain GPA, and there are a variety of scholarships that colleges offer for athletes.  This is a minor nitpick, but it's not wrong to suggest sports can help some black people out of poverty.

But that's a minor point.  More importantly, the idea that black people just don't value education is wrong.  Empirically, factually wrong.  [Here is a very interesting article on the subject](http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2013/01/acting_white_theory_black_academic_achievement_based_on_other_factors.html), discussing whether or not black people have a disdain for education and view it as ""acting white.""  What the various studies cited in the article found is that black students value education as much or even slightly more than their white counterparts.  Black students were more likely to report that their friends wanted them to go to college, a majority of all black students personally plan to go to college, and by far the most common reason for not going was being unable to afford it.  Black people were even slightly more likely to consider high-achieving students ""cool"", and a greater proportion of black people said that their friends would be supportive if they received good grades than white people.  To quote the article:

&gt; For more than three decades, researchers have found that black students consistently exhibit more positive attitudes about education than white students, contrary to their lower levels of academic achievement.

This raises the question about why black academic achievement is lower.  One possibility is that schools in black neighborhoods have much less funding and larger class sizes that make individualized attention difficult.  Another could be a feeling of being unsafe, which, the linked article notes, is correlated with decreased academic achievement.  ""Stereotype threat"", a phenomenon noted by Claude Steele and discussed at length in his book *Whistling Vivaldi*, describes the way anxiety about confirming a stereotype can result in worse performance on a given task.  Whatever the reason(s), it is not ""black culture"".

Now, on to another argument of yours, OP:

&gt; The black community has yet to tackle black on black crime, yet it sees police brutality as more important. We HATE to be labeled as thugs, criminals, yet social media has only made our stereotypes more transparent.

Rates of violent crime are higher in black communities than white ones.  The problem is that viewing crime in the lens of ""personal responsibility"" or otherwise simply blaming criminals, punishing them, and calling it a day, is intellectually bankrupt and morally irresponsible.  And chalking it up to some vague ""black culture"" and then flooding the neighborhood with cops is certainly not a rational response.  Asking why black on black crime is a problem is a legitimate question, however.  Let's investigate.

First, most violent crimes are intraracial- white people are generally more likely to kill other white people, and black people are generally more likely to kill other black people.  You've likely heard this point before so I won't spend much time on it.

Of course, you can counter that black people still commit higher rates of violent crime, and you would be right.  However, the explanation is not as simple as ""black culture"".  [According to one study](http://ann.sagepub.com/content/623/1/93.short):

&gt; Using data from the National Neighborhood Crime Study to examine the racial-spatial dynamic of violence for neighborhoods in thirty-six U.S. cities, the authors demonstrate that along with the social and economic conditions that exist within neighborhoods, proximity to more disadvantaged and especially racially privileged (heavily white) areas is particularly critical in accounting for the large and visible differences in violence found across neighborhoods of different colors.

[Another study](http://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/law_review/v57/7.0-Peterson_Final.pdf) finds that ""gross rates of violence are two and a half to five times greater in the three types of non-white neighborhoods than in white areas (Figure 5), but these differences drop to a maximum of one and three quarters after critical community conditions are taken into account (Table 2).""  These critical community conditions?  Differences in access to external resources (such as home loans) and socioeconomic disadvantages.

[A different study](http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/76/1/93.short) finds that unemployment and underemployment are significantly correlated with willingness to commit crime.  [Black unemployment rates are consistently roughly twice white unemployment rates.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/21/through-good-times-and-bad-black-unemployment-is-consistently-double-that-of-whites/)  [A white criminal and a black person without a criminal record have roughly the same chance of being hired.](http://csgjusticecenter.org/reentry/posts/researchers-examine-effects-of-a-criminal-record-on-prospects-for-employment/)  It's nearly impossible for black people with criminal records to get jobs, and with the War on Drugs, large numbers of black people have been swept up into the criminal justice system as felons, and permanently denied access to the economy.  Between violent criminals and nonviolent drug offenders, 1/3 of black men will be incarcerated at some point in their lives, which means 1/3 of black men will be disadvantaged in finding employment, and more likely to commit crime as a result.

You say the black community needs to tackle black on black crime.  And I agree!  It needs to tackle black on black crime by addressing it at its sources- mass incarceration, poverty, lack of services, police brutality, and segregation.  But of course, we have movements dealing with those issues.  One such movement is #BlackLivesMatter.

Anyway, moving on:

&gt; The issue of police brutality for example seems to be marketed/targeted as a black-only issue. Again, creating polarizing opinions/slogans like ""All Lives Matter""

It is true that white people are often victims of police brutality and mass incarceration.  It's also true that black people are disproportionately victims of those things.  And another thing that is true: black people are more likely than white people to even acknowledge that a problem exists.  By calling attention to a problem white people largely don't want to realize exists, a problem born from post-civil rights movement racism masquerading as a concern for ""law and order"", of course BlackLivesMatter is going to be polarizing.  But it needs to be BlackLivesMatter because of the racist origins of our current system of mass incarceration, the disproportionate police brutality, and the havoc racism continues to inflict on black communities.  To ignore the racial aspects of our current police brutality problem is to fall short of being able to fix it and the system around it.",B,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"With the media covering police killings and the fact that United States Law enforcement kills a relatively large percent of its people every day I believe there should be more repercussions to an officer that kills a citizen.

The benefits to having a process like this includes:

1. No hypocrisy. All because someone has the title of a law enforcer doesn't mean that they shouldn't follow the same legal process as a citizen would. I mean, what if an officer showed up to the scene of a shooting (in which the shooter called 911 for help) and the shooter was there with the weapon and openly admitted to killing the victim in self-defense (which upon observation it was blatantly obvious it wad self-defense)? Surely the officer would draw his/ her weapon at the murderer and scream to get down. They would proceed to cuff them and bring them to the station for booking/ questioning. If an officer called in for back-up after killing someone (even if was obviously out of self defense) they would be approached with ""hey are you okay?"" and ""Let's get the paperwork out of the way so you can have your paid leave."" That to me is hypocritical. Take away the uniform and you have a person who just killed another person.

2. It would make officers think twice before drawing. If they knew they would be processed and charged with murder, I would argue that there would a significant decline in police shootings.

3. It gives the victim a fair chance at their side. Even if they are dead, treating an officer like a criminal discredits any story they come up with giving a better chance for the true series of events to surface. We have seen A LOT of cops make up shit that ""justifies"" the killing when later proved wrong by cameras. If people could just make up stories and be believed 100%, I could go outside right now, shoot someone in the head while no one is looking, plant a knife, claim they came at me with a knife, and get away with 2nd degree murder.

Even if an officer witnessed another officer kill a person when it was blatantly self-defense (eg the person had a gun pointed at the officer) they should still be cuffed and taken in. Just apply the same situation to 2 citizens, surely the one who lives would be charged with murder and only the results of an investigation would set them free.

I'm just frustrated with all the bull shit I hear about cops and would like to hear the logic of the other side because I feel I'm blinded from it. So CMV.

Edit: Okay, too many people are correcting me on minor technicalities which isn't helping. You **cannot** deny that there is an obvious bias when it comes to determining if an officer killing someone is justified or not, at least compared to a citizen killing another citizen. I just believe that bias should not exist.","The first thing you need to recognize is that a police officer isn't just another citizen. They have specialized training because their job puts them in a level of danger that other people don't face. The only comparable group is the military, and that justifies a special set of rules. If all you see is a few cases of unjustified homicide, and you completely ignore the danger that *millions* of officers confront and handle *daily*, then there is no hope to change your view.","The problem is that people want to make the jobs of police officers impossible and that is what you are doing. This of it this way. If you were a police officer and they made your idea into law would you continue to be a police officer? Hell no. 

If police were held to the same laws as other citizens while they were working the job would actually be impossible and no sane person would sign up to do it. How would you suggest a police officer give a speeding ticket without speeding to catch the guy? It would be impossible. Now extend this to a police officer that is called for a possible armed robbery. How could the police officer defuse the situation and possibly save someones life if they were worried about getting arrested for murder?

I'm not saying there isn't a problem with police in this country but there is clearly also a problem with the way this countries citizens view the law. People view the law as suggestions and often ignore them. In so many of these high profile police cases the citizen is blatantly refusing to cooperate this the officer. This is an issue on both sides of the law there. There is mistrust for the government and usually the officer uses too much force or is racially biased. Both things need to change.

The most famous case of police misuse of force (Michael Brown) still really bugs me. People got up in arms because the officer didn't get put in prison for murder. The thing is there clearly wasn't enough evidence to convict that officer of murder. It was always obvious. That officer went on trial for murder and a bunch of people filed conflicting police reports on what happened so any eye witness account was put into question. The people that filed police reports when they didn't know what they were doing fucked up that case and might have got a guilty man set free. THE CIZITIZENS NEED TO CHANGE MORE THAN THE POLICE",B,A,"I would say that reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a clear explanation of the unique challenges and dangers that police officers face in their line of work, which justifies why they may need to operate under different rules than regular citizens. It emphasizes the importance of considering the broader context of law enforcement work and the need for specialized training. On the other hand, reply B focuses more on criticizing the original poster's perspective and does not provide as strong of a counterargument."
predict-explain,"Every election year this is one of the most popular complaints against  candidates: lack of detailed policy prescriptions. 

* ""So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so far he hasn't offered any specifics.""  

* ""Hillary says she has a plan for restarting the Israel-Palestine peace process, but so far nobody has been able to nail her down on the details."" 

* Recently right here on one of the CMV posts about Bernie Sanders, /u/bayernownz1995 says that ""Sanders *does* have a solid page on racial injustice on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to O'Malley's page, Sanders has a lot of work to do.""

You hear these complaints all. The. Time. In newspapers, on blogs, on TV news, in debates, etc. Candidate X offers no details, they're evasive in answering questions, they're canny, they give bland lip service to a problem and make happy talk about solutions, but they never *actually say what it is they're going to do if elected*. It's like the default setting of oppo research, a ready-made criticism to hurl at a candidate if you don't have any meatier, muddier dirt to fling their way. 

But the thing is, there are very good reasons for candidates to be evasive. For one thing, if they were to offer actual policy details during a campaign, then they'd spend the entire rest of the campaign defending and arguing about those details. If someone found an error or mistake or potential pitfall, they might have to revise their plan -- revise a policy that doesn't even exist yet! Political opponents hire specialists in opposition research, and the more material those specialists have, the more they'll be able to distract and distort your candidate's plan in order to make them look bad. Giving them an entire piece of draft legislation, or an entire detailed budget document showing cuts and spending, etc. would be like a godsend to the oppo research people. And all for what? For an imaginary policy that doesn't even exist yet. No candidate in their right mind would open up so many vulnerabilities all for the sake of a policy that doesn't even exist outside of the candidate's website. 

Secondly, no political candidate is running for the office of dictator. Whether someone is running for President, Senate, Congress, Governor, state legislator, dog catcher, etc., the important thing to remember is that politicians have to work with other politicians, and agencies, bureaucracies, other constituents, etc. They have to work with other people to get anything accomplished. So if you get elected to office with a complete, massively detailed economic stimulus package combined with spending cuts and tax cuts, don't expect every other member of Congress to just roll over and rubber stamp your policy. Politics isn't beanbag, and you'd get crucified by the players in Washington (or any other capital). Oh, you promised you were going to cut the F-22 fighter? Well guess what, that's going to throw 60,000 people out of work in my district. And you want me to just vote for it because *your* supporters voted for you? How about f--k you?"" 

If you got elected with a detailed policy proposal, everyone in the government responsible for putting your policy into motion would have you over a barrel. Every change they make to your policy would threaten to make you a ""liar,"" a judas, a traitor, etc. to the people who supported you, as well of course as your political enemies. Your policy details would become a millstone around your neck and a gun to your head. Your friends and enemies alike would be able to use all of your detailed promises on the campaign trail in order to wrap you around their fingers.

So that's my view: politicians would be insane to offer detailed policy answers to any given question, and they are wise to stick to vague generalities, advertising language, happy talk, etc. Can you think of a good reason for politicians to spell out their promises in detail? 

**EDIT -- After 16 hours, most challengers haven't dug very deep into the issue or looked at it from different angles. For instance, what about examples of actual candidates who did in fact provide detailed proposals during an election? Did they pay for it or benefit from it? I got a lot of deltas burning a hole in my pocket here....**

predict-explain,"This CMV was inspired by this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3cfy8u/being_fat_is_not_a_disability/

I believe that being obese is a disability.  Now, before you rip me to pieces, hear me out.  It's a disability that a person does to themselves.  It's a disability that is completely avoidable, and I think for these reason people don't like to classify it as a disability.  However, I still think it's a disability because it makes it harder to perform every day tasks.

Here's a comparison that I use.  Imagine you cut off your leg with a hacksaw, for no good reason.  You're now missing a leg, and I would consider you to be disabled.  You did it to yourself, and you could have made different life choices to avoid becoming disabled, but you are disabled all the same.  You might argue that someone who cuts off their own leg obviously has some mental issues, but that could be said for a person who allows themself to become severely obese.  For example, depression leads to overeating for many people.

So why should obese people be denied some of the ""benefits"" of being disabled, just because they did it to themselves?

And I hate that I feel like I have to even say this, but no, I am not overweight, and I do not have any personal agenda.  I am honestly curious why people believe this, and I am willing to reconsider my views.

He may regret his decision but there's nothing he can do about it, his leg is still gone.  He can't get it back no matter how much he tries, it's just gone.

Being obese (in most cases) is not just a 'well they did it to themself' but rather the result of an ongoing series of self-destructive choices ('they are continuing to do it to themself').  The obese person (generally) only stays obese through a continued lifestyle of bad diet and low exercise.  This is a choice they make every time they pick up a McLardBurger.  If the obese person improved their diet and started exercising, their weight would improve and they would no longer be disabled.

Therefore, we can say that an obese person is *continually choosing to be disabled* and thus shouldn't be afforded the same benefits as someone who does not have a choice.

Let me make an analogy here- **let's say I tied a rope around my legs and handcuffed myself behind my back.  I then claim that I am disabled** and I need a wheelchair and someone to push me around and spoon feed me because I am unable to do these things.  **Would you support spending tens of thousands of dollars to pay for my wheelchair and an aide?**  
No of course not, because I am only 'disabled' by choice and I can choose to become un-disabled whenever I want.  Therefore while my present situation may require accommodations, *by choosing not to correct that situation I am also choosing to require those accommodations*.  This is little different than parking in a handicap spot because I'm too lazy to walk across the parking lot- handicap accommodations are for people who are handicapped by illness or injury, not people who choose to reduce their own capabilities.

The correct solution for someone like this not to spend $10k+ on wheelchairs and aides and whatnot, it's to give them the tools they need to improve their own situations-  a handcuff key and a pair of scissors will do nicely.  Or if you want to go REALLY hands on, un-handcuff them and then cut the rope for them.

-----

**Let's take a couple of similar analogies to illustrate.**

My job involves just talking on the phone, and I'm really really lazy.  I sit in bed all day talking on the phone, never moving an inch.  As a result my muscles atrophy and i'm now extremely weak.  Do I have the right to demand that self-closing doors have their tension reduced because I'm otherwise too weak to open them?  

It's the middle of summer, and I show up somewhere wearing a thick winter parka.  I complain that it's too hot and I demand the AC be turned up.  I refuse to take off my parka because it's my right to wear the parka, but my overheating will cause me medical problems therefore I need accommodation.  Is this reasonable?  No of course not because I'm creating a problem and demanding other people fix it (even when I can fix it for myself cheaper and faster).

If I drink too much at a party, and I'm still drunk or very hung over the next day and I can't do my job, should I be able to claim medical disability leave and get a paid day off?  No of course not, because the only reason I'm unable to work is because I made irresponsible bad choices the night before.

If I do a bunch of drugs and show up to work fucked up, and my manager fires me, should I be able to claim discrimination against a disabled person because my manager discriminated against my disability?  No of course not, because any 'disability' I have is the direct result of irresponsible bad choices.

If I get addicted and I have a continual habit of drug or alcohol abuse, should I demand special accommodation from my employer because of a disability?  No, because (while addiction is very real), it's still within my control.  My employer shouldn't be forced to pay for my bad life choices.

And food/weight is the same thing.  If I eat two McLardBurgers and a 128oz soda for lunch and again for dinner every day, pretty soon I'll be morbidly obese.  Should I demand that doors be made wider for me to fit through?  Should I demand a free scooter from the government due to 'disability'?  Should I demand airlines give me two seats instead of one (but without charging me extra)?  Why should I get these accommodations if someone who's 'disabled' due to drinking or drugs (also choices, just like food) does not get those accommodations?  

**Why should the drunk or the drug user be told to take responsibility, while the obese person gets a free pass?**

-----

Now this all said- there ARE legitimate medical conditions that directly cause obesity, and it's important to recognize their existence whenever on this subject.  Not everyone who's obese is just a fatass.  However it is the vast majority...","I have a couple different points to make, so this might not be very organized. But the context of when and how the discussion comes up matters.

1: Imagine you have a dude who doesn't have a leg because he carelessly cut is off with a hacksaw. Then you have an obese person who is too big to walk. They both go to a grocery store and there is one scooter. Well the amputee can't walk because he has one leg. The obese person could just stop eating so much, and maybe wouldn't be so big if they'd just walk. In fact, they probably SHOULD be walking. When people say obesity isn't a disability, I think it usually comes up in a context like this, where people try to use obesity as a way of getting out of basic activities of daily living or to get special accomodations. People generally don't like the idea of someone getting special treatment because they are too lazy to walk, or don't have the self-control to maintain their health. It's kind of more like someone who complains about being thirsty, but won't drink water.

2: Obesity can cause disabilities, but isn't a disability in and of itself. Again, people lose sympathy when it is something where people make a daily decision to stay that way. 

3: Sometimes people will blame their obesity on their health conditions, rather than their health conditions on their obesity. So when a person says they can't exercise because they have a bad back or bad knees or whatever else and that's why they're obese, the common sentiment is that ""no, you aren't disabled, you're just fat. Lose weight and you won't be 'disabled' anymore"".",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A presents a strong argument by highlighting the ongoing choices that lead to obesity and how individuals have the power to change their situation through healthier lifestyle choices. The analogy of tying oneself up and claiming disability is effective in illustrating the concept that individuals can choose to improve their situation. Additionally, the comparison to other scenarios like addiction and irresponsible behavior further strengthens the argument that obesity should not be classified as a disability.

On the other hand, Reply B also makes valid points, but it focuses more on the context in which the discussion of obesity as a disability arises. While it does address the issue of obesity causing disabilities, it does not delve as deeply into the responsibility individuals have in their own health choices. 

Overall, Reply A provides a more comprehensive and compelling argument that is likely to challenge the original poster's views on obesity as a disability."
predict-explain,"Let me start off by stating what I believe the reddit basic income theory is. From what I have read from /r/basicIncome, the idea is that in a future utopian society computers will take all of our jobs and there will be a huge number of people out of work. Basic income would be a government-issued wage that would act as a safety net for these newly underemployed/unemployed workers. 

I am not making this post to argue against future automation problems getting rid of jobs. Yes, jobs will require more skills and basic menial tasks may soon be replaced. But that is frictional unemployment, not structural. Its incorrect to say that because a McDonalds cashier got laid off because of a touchscreen order screen that said McDonald's worker will never work again. 

Many people on reddit would like to implement Basic Income today. They state that it would rid our problems with a complicated tax code, food stamps and other welfare programs. The huge issue is when you have a dead wage safety net you create a massive systematic disincentive to people to work. If people make a certain wage while working zero hours a week, why go get a job at the grocery store? The marginal value of a full time job becomes diluted. 

Next off, wages are considered elastic. Wages are often sticky, but they will still react to the market, especially new hires. If everyone is getting basic income, employers would simply cut costs and pay people less in wages because why not? Employees would be indifferent because they aren't netting less money, since basic income would make up the difference. Competitive wages would suffer.

A) Let the 10% work and earn huge wages and let the 90% starve unemployed because they can't find a job above minimum wage

B) Let the 10% work and earn huge wages while the 90% work at miserable jobs below minimum wage

C) Decrease work hours and educate the population so that everyone can perform some degree of high-qualified job and put 100% of the population with very few work-hours and earning a nice salary

D) Let the 10% work and earn huge wages while providing basic income for the 90%. Those with talent would rather work and earn huge wages than live with basic income, which is high enough to live but not high enough to afford luxuries, so if you want to have a plasma tv, two cars and a fancy computer, you'll better get a job!

Personally I prefer D, because there's still an incentive to work, but only if you're talented, so the 90% can get a comfortable but modest life without having to work nor starve on the streets, while the 10% can get a really fancy life which is so amazing it completely offsets the fact that they have to work.

We will never be able to see a large amount of entry-level jobs again, and because not everybody has incredible amounts of talent and even if they did there's simply no way our planet has enough resources to give the 7 billion people in this planet a fancy high-level job managing automated machines, then the only way is to distribute the labor. Either by C) massively decreasing work hours and spending immense amounts of resources in education, or by D) giving everyone a basic income for being alive and then providing an incentive to working by paying them huge salaries which because of the automation and technological enhancement would be a possibility.

TL;DR Basic income is not going to make people stop working because it only provides enough money to stay above the poverty line and most people would rather work and have a fancy life with large paychecks.","That's like saying ""Brain surgery is a terrible idea, everyone who has taken a first aid class knows that you should close a hole in your skull ASAP!"".

&gt;From what I have read from /r/basicIncome, the idea is that in a future utopian society computers will take all of our jobs and there will be a huge number of people out of work. Basic income would be a government-issued wage that would act as a safety net for these newly underemployed/unemployed workers. 

That's only a fraction of it. Basic income would serve as the basic means to redistribute resources, based on the idea that automation and organization which allows much of our current productivity is a common resource, not a private one. This would indeed serve to mitigate the consequences of automation and concentration of capital in the hands of ever fewer owners, but first and foremost it's a different way to organize resource distribution, since labor is no longer in chronic shortage, so it makes no sense to force people to provide it by threats of misery and starvation.

&gt;But that is frictional unemployment, not structural.

That's just your opinion.

&gt;The huge issue is when you have a dead wage safety net you create a massive systematic disincentive to people to work.

The current system punishes people who start working and stop being eligible for welfare, by taking away that welfare. A basic income would remain stable, and those people would get the full incentive to work instead of a punishment.

&gt;If people make a certain wage while working zero hours a week, why go get a job at the grocery store? The marginal value of a full time job becomes diluted. 

If unemployment is in the double digits, why expect everyone to work full time at all? The economy doesn't need that much labor anymore.

From another angle, why do people now often have several jobs accumulated? We can observe that income from one job does not stop them from getting another, *even* if it requires working from dusk till dawn. So I don't see why think people are going to be couch potatoes all day.

&gt;Next off, wages are considered elastic. Wages are often sticky, but they will still react to the market, especially new hires. If everyone is getting basic income, employers would simply cut costs and pay people less in wages because why not? Employees would be indifferent because they aren't netting less money, since basic income would make up the difference. Competitive wages would suffer. 

*Then* they would effectively reduce the added value of work for their employees, who would quit - because now they *do* have an alternative. So that would force employers to bid the price of labor back up again.",B,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

My school was great. We went on fun field trips, and even a trip to Europe.

Not all public schools are equal. Others have already made this point, but you'd learn a lot if you listened to [these](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) [two](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/563/the-problem-we-all-live-with-part-two) episodes of This American Life. Public schools are also subject to the prejudices of the society that surrounds them. In those episodes you'll ~~see~~ hear parents of white children protest, loudly and vocally, against the school's decision to accept black students from another neighbourhood, despite the fact that the black kids had to travel over an hour to get to the majority-white school. It's definitely an eye-opener.

So another concern: What about the money? Currently, about [4%](http://equipeducation.org/Downloads/HomeschoolPopulationReport2010.pdf) of K-12 students in the US are homeschooled. Where would the public schools find the money to accommodate all these people?

Not all homeschooling is bad either. If you'd take a look at [these](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ794828) [two](http://equipeducation.org/Downloads/HomeschoolPopulationReport2010.pdf) studies you'll see that homeschooled students perform at least just as well as students attending public schools. The second study is the most interesting since it shows that with good, structured homeschooling the children consistently outperformed public school students across several measures. Just as all public schools aren't equal, all homeschooling isn't equal. But it *can* do a very good job when used well.","As someone who loved being homeschooled, and was much better off for it, I can say that you should at least have an understanding of something before you try to make it illegal.

First, education takes up an extraordinarily large portion of children's lives and we should be careful when making significant changes. Because of this, you should realize that a all-inclusive legal mandate is probably not the best approach. Disregarding any issues of parental rights, it's generally more efficient and productive to allow for homeschooling. Parents are generally more in-tune to their children's needs and care more about the quality of education. Even though many academically challenged students are switched to homeschooling, homeschoolers consistently perform better on standardized testing.

&gt; Homeschooling your kid is just insurance that he/she will be socially awkward, and disadvantaged

You should research homeschooling more, instead of relying on stereotypes, if you actually think this is the case.

Second, it's evident from your post that you do not understand the US public school system (I'm assuming US from the context of your post). Most people would laugh at the naive belief that:

&gt; In public school you are exposed to many different views, opinions, and types of people. These problems would be solved if everyone had to go to public school. Everyone would have an equal education, and equal opportunity.

The most obvious issue with this is that public schools are already staggeringly unequal. Here's a great video about education and some of its issues:
http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_changing_education_paradigms

&gt; The kids who go to private schools are usually rich white kids that already have a socioenconomic advantage.

Again, it seems like you are basing your opinion off of ignorant stereotypes. Approach the issue from a perspective of assumed ignorance--try to learn about something before you form an opinion. 

&gt; I have never seen any benifit to private school. 

They usually teach spelling and communication which are important life skills.

&gt; My school was great. We went on fun field trips, and even a trip to Europe

While it's nice that your anecdotal experience went well for you, have the capacity to realize that it doesn't necessarily apply in all, or even the majority, of cases.

Finally, realize that ""I don't like X"" shouldn't always translate to ""X should be illegal""; X, in this case, is homeschooling. A recurring anthem for this forum full of  ""There should be a LAW"" posts:

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on defending homeschooling and criticizing the original poster's lack of understanding of the US public school system. While it does provide some valid points, it does not directly address the original poster's arguments as effectively as reply A does.

predict-explain,"I have recently been told that my pro-life position is ""forcing my ideas on others"".  I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary.  This "" forcing ideals on others"" is an argument I hear often and I just want to understand it better. I believe that a fetus is a human being. I confess, that is my view, not everyone's view. I believe an abortion is the murder of that child. This is still my view. Not everyone's. United States law entitles all humans to life. Passing legislation opposing abortion is simply following that idea in my way. I am not forcing anyone to agree with me. I am simply making sure the law is followed as I read it. 

For a hypothetical:

It's 1870 and there is a white who believes that black people are subhuman (not so uncommon at the time). If I say no they are not subhuman. They are human beings and I will prosecute you if you kill them am I "" forcing my ideals on them"" or am I simply protecting what I believe to be human life. And even if I am ""forcing my ideals"" on the man isn't it necessary to do so?  

The abortion debate is a matter of whether the fetus is indeed entitled to the rights of a living human. It has nothing to do with a group forcing it's ideas on another and such statements are only used to unjustly vilify the pro-life movement.","All laws, no matter how uncontroversial, involve using the state to force your ideas on others. If you need the government to put people in jail when they engage in a particular action, then you are by definition forcibly preventing individuals from doing something.

It has nothing to do with a group forcing it's ideas on another and such statements are only used to unjustly vilify the pro-life movement.

Your assessment of what ""forcing your ideas on others"" means at face value is completely fair. And I really liked your example with racism (of course there's a difference between being black and being a fetus, but that wasn't the point anyway).

A more charitable reading, however, goes as follows: the arguments for ""fetal right to life"" are extremely weak, and it is not reasonable to use them to undermine bodily autonomy.

It doesn't just mean that you're forcing your opinion: it means that your opinion is not backed up enough to fuck other people because of it.",A,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. If you have a nose that is 2 1/2 inches long and crushed in eye socket, then yes, you have an out. 

However, if you are not disfigured, and your facial syemetry is average, and you are still considered unattractive, well then it's your fault. 

Are you overweight? Your fault. 

Do you dress like a 35 year old male who still lives in his mom's basement, and wears black velcro shoes?  Your fault. 

Are you balding? Depending on the structure of your skull, this is debatable, but you can take steps to mitigate this that don't involve a comb over. Halfway your fault. 

Do you have acne? Take better care of your skin. There are some miracle acne drugs out there. Your fault. 

Do you only wear shit tier clothes every single day because their ""comfortable""? Your fault. 

Do you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you have no concept of fashion? Your fault. 

Do you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you can't afford decent clothes? Work harder, go back to school, still your fault. 

Ladies, do you not wear makeup because it takes too much effort to apply? Your fault. If makeup didn't work there wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar industry surrounding it. 

Do you smell like ass because you don't take a shower every day, use deodorant, and wear cologne/perfume? Your fault. 

Do you have a shit tier job because you have a degree in History? Your fault. 

Men, do you not shave your unibrow/nose hair? Your fault. 

Nearly any excuse you can give for why you are unattractive is something you can control for and therefore makes it your fault. I do not presume to say that taking all these steps will make someone a 10/10 but if you are a 2/10, I firmly believe you can go to a 7/10. Everyone can be a 7/10 out of ten. Again, this bars physical characteristics that you have no control over. If you're a 4'10 male, it's not your fault, you just have shitty height genetics.

Spare me the hateful pm's.","A lot of those things you mentioned (acne treatment, fashionable clothes, hair treatment, gym membership to lose weight) require money.

You might say ""they should work harder, go to school, and get a better job,"" but I don't think their looks will be the first thing they spend their new salary on.","you aren't 100% wrong, but the reasons you're wrong are significant, i think.

for now, i'm going to take it for granted that you meant people with average facial structures were entirely capable of making themselves more attractive at large. you seem to not quite take that seriously the idea of people with facial structures that are simply unattractive straight up and only talk about extreme cases, but i feel like taking this approach gets more to the spirit of your post.

what i think is the key is to discuss the the fact that you said ""it's largely your fault"". not ""the causes are attributable to your lifestyle or choices"", or ""you played a significant role in it"", but ""fault"" implying that there's some blame involved, and there's some sort of responsibility to make yourself look more attractive. am i misinterpreting what you were getting at here? because ""it's your fault"" doesn't really feel like neutral phrasing. there definitely feels like some kind of lot of blaming going on here. 

you don't seem to really take seriously however, the idea that a lot of these conditions, and whether or not someone acts on them, is not fully in the control of the person it applies to. you seem like the kind of person who'd say 'no matter your conditions, if you have a choice in the matter, and you don't take that choice, you are 100% responsible, and frankly, might be a pussy for not makign that choice', am i right?

for more clarification: do you think say, given any let's sat 3/10 person, and if you found the right clothes, exercise routines, hairstyles, maybe makeup routines and hygein practices, they could be generally attractive? do you think that would really hold up and that facial attractiveness that falls below average can really just be propped up by dressing up everything else?",B,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

This challenges the original poster's assertion that being unattractive is solely the individual's fault and introduces the idea that external factors can play a significant role.

predict-explain,"I believe this comic expresses the argument most cogently:

http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/

Now, to my wall of text:

I run a small software company that's reasonably successful. I've been doing this for the past 15 years.

I've been employing people for years that I have never met — and quite possibly never will meet.

Last time I met any of my developers face to face was maybe 6 years ago.

I perceive no value whatsoever in meeting face to face. None.

Working together in an office is an impediment to getting work done, and is a source of constant interruption.

Email is generally better for productivity than face to face contact, or instant messaging.

Both face to face contact, and instant messaging, are distractions, and are useful primarily in the situation that you cannot progress on anything without immediate input. Such situations are extraordinary.

The people I meet face to face in my life are my wife, my son, and our nanny. I don't have a social need for more.

I believe people who think they need face to face contact for work in software development are either confusing social needs with work — or possibly, I would fear, aren't competent to work on their own. Or maybe they're involved in some kind of work that involves extraordinary synchronization — the kind of which I do not know.

If someone can't work independently, and must constantly interrupt other developers, I would consider them a burden, rather than an asset. To be an asset, one must be able to get work done on one's own, and coordinate as necessary.

In fact, I would go so far as to say that, if you're not going to physically touch the other person, there is nothing you can do in a face to face meeting that you cannot do online.

There's literally no reason to meet unless you're going to kiss, or have sex, or give a person a massage.","Yes, the coding part of software development requires focus.  Sure.

But good engineers care deeply about the product - they fight for things they care about, they tend to help define and drive features.

Tell me then, how do you come to consensus &amp; divide work with purely asymmetrical communication? How do you motivate remote employees?  

More often than not, remote shops have very poor answers to those questions, and as a result what they have are a number of a remote employees or contractors that just kind of mail it in.  It might be profitable if you have a good business model and do custom/enterprise software, but it's hard to build *great* product that way.

Don't get me wrong, some companies have figured out how to do distributed correctly... but it's a very hard culture to build and maintain.

I'm curious as to how you do it.","This is a bit of a weird example, but Naughty Dog and Insomniac Games used to work in the same Universal Studios backlot. They pretty much worked in the same cubicles. The games they created, like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon, were better games because of the constant chatting between members of the two companies. Each of the two examined the other company's software and saw amazing new features they could add to themselves. It was a source of friendly competition, and everyone was involved. The softwares the two companies created proved to be some of the most top-selling and highly regarded Playstation titles at the time. None of this innovation would have happened if the employees of both worked online without physical contact with each other. Doesn't this show that sometimes, physical environments do help to make a better software in the first place?",B,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A raises valid points about the importance of consensus, division of work, and motivation in software development. It challenges the original poster's belief that face to face contact is unnecessary and highlights the potential drawbacks of purely remote communication. Reply A also acknowledges that some companies have successfully implemented distributed teams, but emphasizes the difficulty in building and maintaining a strong culture in such environments.

On the other hand, Reply B provides an anecdotal example of how physical environments can foster innovation and collaboration in software development. While the example is compelling, it may not be enough to sway the original poster's strong belief that face to face contact is unnecessary. Reply A's focus on practical challenges and the importance of teamwork in software development is more likely to prompt the original poster to reconsider their stance on the issue."

Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had? We cannot know. We should not force our ideas through time, expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers.

What I can't understand is why we are clinging to the past, to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today. We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs. We should update, revise, and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are. I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either. I am saying we should interpret it for today, update it, and use our revised version instead. Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed. It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws. It would take a lot of work, a lot would change, but I believe we would be better for it. CMV

---Edit---
Many responses seem to think I am saying scrap the whole thing and start over. No, I am saying we need an updated, reworded one that uses the meanings as we take them today. All men are equal shoule read all persons, prohibition and its repeal should just be removed, the 15th and 19th should be combined and all inclusive with restrictions put in after the fact. Those are examples of what I mean but not the whole of it.

To CMV you need to show me that having an old, poorly worded document is better than a revision of it in modern terms. It would be hard to do but it would be better for the nation and easier to work with than if we left it be. CMV

It would be a waste of tax payers money to go through the process you are describing. If it aint broke, don't fix it. I worked at the State Bar of California and can tell you that California has been trying to rewrite its Rules of Professional Conduct for 15 years. And they will never finish. It is a fruitless endeavor.

With that said, any time an ambiguity in the law comes up, usually through a landmark case that rises up through the judicial system into the Supreme Court, our Supreme Court justices make a ruling on it. Now, whenever that situation arises again, we can determine the right course of action.

Any time societal views change, like slavery or gay marriage, Congress passes amendments to the Constitution. An amendment is literally an update to a document, which is exactly what you are asking for.

There is nothing that is not current. No one is reading the Constitution and having trouble figuring out if slavery is still legal. It seems like you are suggesting that all layman have some sort of rule book for dummies that simplifies all of today's laws. Not gonna happen. There is way too much gray area for a simple rewording to cover. It is all decided by case law. That is what the justice system is for.","There are a few problems with this, but I'll address what I believe to be the main problem with the idea.

You suggested this be done every 100 years or so. There's nothing inherently wrong with that amount of time, but rather having a set date in general.

Think about if, in today's political climate, everyone knew that in, say, 15 years the Constitution would have to be redone. Most politics for the next 15 years would be totally centered around each political party trying to gain the upper hand for the next rewrite. It would be similar to a lame duck president, except it would have far more detrimental effects to the overall political process.

The Constitution was designed to allow for amendments when we as a nation see that something needs to be changed or updated. And the Supreme Court exists to interpret the Constitution and its amendments. Adding this countdown timer to its revision would distract from the day-to-day policy making that is, in reality, more important to our government.",B,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a practical perspective on the issue, highlighting the existing mechanisms in place to update and interpret the Constitution, such as through amendments and case law. The user also brings up the potential waste of resources and the complexity of trying to rewrite such a foundational document. Additionally, the user points out that societal changes are addressed through amendments, showing that the Constitution is adaptable to changing times.

On the other hand, Reply B raises valid concerns about the potential negative consequences of setting a specific timeline for revising the Constitution. However, it doesn't directly address the original poster's arguments about the need for modernization and simplification of the Constitution. It focuses more on the potential political implications of a set revision schedule.

Overall, Reply A provides a more thorough and direct response to the original poster's arguments, making it more likely to change their view."
predict-explain,"In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want to is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to things that are unacceptable to do to a person without his or her permission. Telling someone that they can't get a medical procedure done (or, likewise, telling that they HAVE to get a medical procedure done) is just as awful as is dictating how they were their hair or how they dress. In that same vein, what makes it okay in our society for your significant other to dictate who you sleep with? 

Sex in our society is a recreational activity enjoyed by most adults in at least some capacity. People dictating what their SOs do for fun in their free time seems rather controlling. Adults should feel free to do what their bodies what they wish as long as they aren't physically forcing another person to do something. Forcing another person to only have sex with you seems to me like an awfully controlling behavior and takes away the body autonomy that they should have. 

I can understand if a couple decides between the two of them that would like to sleep exclusively with each other. It's just surprising to me at times that it is the norm to be mad enough at your SO to break up with them if they have sex with someone outside of the relationship. I understand that people cheat all the time, but open relationships just seem to be the exception rather than the norm. 

If you want a monogamous relationship and your SO sleeps with someone else, then you shouldn't be mad at your SO. You should simply realize that you guys want different things out of a relationship and part ways. Getting angry would be controlling your SO and taking away his or her own control over his or her own body. 

And just for clarification: I am not saying that everyone should go out and cheat on their SOs. I am more stating that it *should* be normal and acceptable for people to have sex with people outside of a two person relationship for no other reason than that it is oddly controlling to insist that your SO sleep with no one besides you. 

Also, I wanted to point out that I am purposefully not using particular genders. It is just as bad to for a woman to tell a man he can't have sex outside the relationship as it would be if a man told a woman the same thing. 

So, please. Change my view! Why should it be the norm to have monogamous relationships?

Most people want an exclusive relationship so exclusive relationships are the norm. A person agrees not to have sex with others because they want their partner to do the same, there is no ""force"" involved. Only a mutual agreement where both parties abide by the same rule.

If someone wants a non monogamous relationship, they are obligated to inform any potential partners of that so the partner is not deceived.","Situation you describe is only possible for a few decades, in developed enough countries, and among people that do well enough for themselves. In any other circumstances, family is pretty much instrumental for survival (mostly when kids are involved of course). In most cases, family only works well with monogamy. So, other ways don't really work in majority of cases (and did not work at all until recently), and therefore can't be the norm.

For the people who are ""applicable"" to this, it's of course just a matter of their mutual agreement, not something dictated by economical needs. You don't want society to control them in the direction of being monogamous, but controlling in the opposite direction is really the same thing, just opposite. So more accurate, the ""norm"" should be understanding and honoring the agreement you enter in.",B,A,"I would say that Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a simple and straightforward explanation for why monogamous relationships are the norm - because most people want an exclusive relationship. It emphasizes the idea of mutual agreement and consent in a relationship, rather than control or force. It also addresses the importance of honesty and communication in relationships, highlighting the need for individuals to inform potential partners if they are seeking a non-monogamous relationship.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the historical and societal context of monogamous relationships, which may not directly address the original poster's concerns about control and autonomy in relationships. While it does mention the importance of mutual agreement, it also brings up economic factors and survival as reasons for why monogamy has been the norm in the past. This argument may not directly address the original poster's view about body autonomy and control in relationships."
predict-explain,"I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in top movie list rankings. I am a westerner who has had exposure mainly to western film but also enjoys many other film types and cultures including Japanese and anime film.

However, I don't much care for Studio Ghibli stuff. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I don't like it. Except for Hisaishi's music, which I think is beautiful. I don't know why everyone seems to like these films so much. 

It bothers me as lots of my other views in life are congruent with the norm, or I can see why they vary.

I've watched lots of Ghibli films in order to give them a chance. I've already heard lots of people arguing that the artwork is great (and I do agree it is) and that's what makes the film great, but that doesn't cut it for me; the same people who argue in this way don't seem to apply that logic to the other films they watch and so must be adapting their viewing style for Ghibli or just repeating something they heard somewhere else, not responding as they normally would (perhaps with reference to direction, plot, acting, action, scripting, etc) when asked why they like a film.

Any comments or thoughts (outside of 'the artwork is so good') would be appreciated.","I'm unaware of many people who rate movies based on specific criteria outside of movie critics themselves. And even then, most are willing to accept that a movie can be a gestalt, a sum greater than its parts. And even then, critics also accept the visual and spectacle of a movie as being part of whether it's good. Your analysis (or expectation of how someone else would analyze a movie) is almost all technical, which does not speak to the quality of a movie and how it can actually affect people.

So, here are a few things usually part of why Ghibili movies are considered great which also apply to western movies.

1. Visuals. Especially in an era of nearly-realistic CGI, the sheer awe of a visually stunning movie are part of what make it good. When people put Jurassic Park on their lists of best movies, it is in part because of how gorgeous the visuals were. And how that creates the important sense of wonder that drives the rest of the film. See also Gravity. Or the Lord of the Rings, which was lauded in large part for looking the way that movie should look.

2. Characterization. None of the characters are evil for the sake of evil, or lack convictions which are (at the very least) understandable. The Noh isn't malicious, just misunderstood. Now think about how often bad action movies are slammed for lacking good characterization beyond ""gritty tough hero"" and ""bad guy for no apparent reason."" That scarecrow from Howl's moving castle has more characterization without *speaking* than Tony Stark has gotten in five movies.

3. Cohesive, character-driven, plots. Benefits of having good characters is that the plots are not macguffin-driven or rely on happenstance or sins of convenience for resolution. 

4. Acting. Yep, even animated characters can act. First, they're damned expressive as characters. Second, the voice acting is top-notch.

5. Stories, both relatable to the audience and unique. Yes, it takes a bit of suspension of disbelief to believe in the world of Spirited Away, but not much more than the suspension of disbelief for the Avengers. And once that's taken care of, the story itself is relatable. A young child who irresponsibly acts, and needs to fix it? That's old-school Spielberg at his best. A man who has acted selfishly is confronted with the need to consider others (and love) and risks himself to protect others? Yes, some of them are silly, but the ones people consider among the best movies are ones which resonate.

6. Emotional impact. This comes from the characters being fleshed out and relatable, but there are none but the most hard-hearted who don't tear up at the goddamned scarecrow in Howl's moving castle. That's a more significant emotional impact *without* having to resort to ham-handed tear-jerking.","One thing you should know is that virtually every Studio Ghibli film revolves around a coming-of-age plot. The plot throws challenges and quick change at immature characters that are unprepared for it, they must adapt and must be brave and show what's inside, their internal struggle is often emphasized.

Also every character, good or bad, has motives and development. Yubaba the bathouse owner is not evil just because, she's got a business to run. The witch of the waste is heartbroken and proud, which leads to wrath. Lady Eboshi cared about her town, employing the marginalized lepers, starting nothing short of an industrial revolution, albeit forgetting the damage to the environment. 

The braveness of characters is also rarely your macho western protagonist willing to face and slice million monsters and then self-immolate. The braveness is often displayed by vulnerable characters that have much to lose and don't have the skills or the strength to chop their way to victory, they must be cunning, firm, and rely on their (often newly made) friends if they want to succeed. 

All this combined with the art and the music, like you mentioned, makes just about every Studio Ghibli film a masterpiece.",B,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a detailed analysis of why Studio Ghibli films are considered great, touching on various aspects such as visuals, characterization, plot, acting, storytelling, and emotional impact. It also draws parallels to Western films to help the original poster understand the appeal of Studio Ghibli films. 

On the other hand, while Reply B also offers some valuable insights into Studio Ghibli films, it focuses primarily on the coming-of-age plot and character development, which may not resonate as strongly with someone who is looking for a broader perspective on why these films are so highly regarded. 

Overall, Reply A provides a more comprehensive and well-rounded argument that addresses multiple aspects of Studio Ghibli films, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"Context: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA+ friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never gone to one myself (always find out about it a few days after it happens), but I'm planning on going to volunteer at next year's Boston parade, assuming I'm home from school in time.

I personally get a little uncomfortable when I see straight people partying hard at Pride parades. To me, the parades are supposed to celebrate marginalized social groups who are often shoved under wave after wave of oppression and hatred the other 364 days of the year and has this one day to fully let loose and celebrate in the face of a culture who still may not accept them in the way that they'd like. When straight people jump in, it almost feels like they're co-opting the one day in which non-straight people are finally in control. It seems to me to be similar to straight people putting a rainbow filter over their profile pictures - in theory, it might be OK, but in practice it shifts the attention from the LGBTQA+ people who deserve it onto the straight person who steps in. Almost like a ""Look at me, I'm celebrating pride! Look at how great I am!""

And, yeah, to a certain extent I think this display of solidarity is good. Gay/trans/queer rights won't move forward without the support of those already in power - straight people - and it's nice to see people united across gender and sexuality boundaries in order to celebrate how far we've come and prepare for how far we still have to go. That being said, though, I think there's a point at which a display of solidarity becomes less about the people for whom the solidarity is shown and more about the people who are ""showing"" the solidarity. I think that at a certain point, support for the LGBTQA+ community can transition into an exercise in self-promotion and narcissism, and I'm not super comfortable with that.

This is why I think that straight/cis people who participate in Pride parades should spend some of that participation on volunteering. The parades really run on volunteers, and if a straight/cis person spends time doing the thankless task of picking up trash, filling and lugging big containers of water everywhere, or making sure a first-aid tent is properly staffed, it helps show support for the LGBTQA+ community in a way that simply taking selfies with a shirtless parader will never be able to. I think it's a great way to be an ally to the community in a way that doesn't obnoxiously trumpet that allyship, and it might teach people more about what really makes the revelry run smoothly and give them a new appreciation for something many almost take for granted.

tl;dr Volunteering is a helpful form of allyship for straight/cis people in a way that just going to the parade and celebrating is not.

**EDIT:** Just a clarification - I believe that people shouldn't be *forced* to volunteer, and going to the parade at all is still preferable by far to not going. That said, I think that going and volunteering is far enough preferable to just going to participate that it should be pretty heavily suggested for people planning to go.

Reply A raises a valid point that volunteering does not inherently create modesty, and that there are plenty of narcissistic individuals who volunteer for various causes. The user acknowledges the importance of volunteering and doing good deeds, but also points out that it is possible to be smug and narcissistic while volunteering. This challenges the original poster's assertion that volunteering is a more humble form of allyship compared to just attending the parade.

predict-explain,"Hello CMV,

I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from your basic youth teams) and never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing it was simple as that. By losing and not being rewarded we understood we had to try harder as an individual and try harder as a team to win. This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team.  I really dont understand the idea of rewarding everyone for not winning, it's almost like saying ""hey, even if you dont try you still win"". I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize. To me that just teaches a kid that NOT giving your best will still result in a prize. What lesson does that teach you when you grow up? That your failure or lack of effort will be rewarded regardless of how you performed? Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up? Personally if I had a kid and he/she played a sport I wouldn't allow the coach or a parent to give them a trophy for simply participating, I would make them understand that a reward/trophy is earned by hard work and dedication. I know not all kids are athletic but I still dont understand the concept or idea. 
We all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? Again, I am not trying to sound cold but I just dont understand the concept of rewarding 
failure/losing, CMV......

Edit: thanks for all the answers, feedback and insight. Many of you helped CMV. Again, I hope I didn't come off as cold or inconsiderate. I have younger cousins and love to see them succeed in anything they do, especially sports. I was more interested in having a discussion as to ""why"" and the mentality behind it. Many of you made valid arguments and gave me some great insight. I'm happy to keep discussing if people are interested but please note I am not against the idea but was more interested in helping me change my view of it. If anything please continue to give your children positive feedback, effective communication, motivation and let them know that team work is a great thing. I recommend everyone put their kids in sports (dont push them into it but help and guide them into something they love doing or are very passionate about). It really does pay off when you get older and helps them build some self confidence and understand the dynamics of a social environment. Thanks again everyone! 

Edit 2: Since the discussion continues, I think children under 12 should only get participation Trophies. Once you hit that age you should be teaching your kids the fundamentals of structured team work, effort and the idea that life will not reward your for simply showing up. Giving participation trophies to kids 13 and above is not a good life lesson. If you care to continue CMV on that! 

Edit 3: Thanks everyone for the continued conversation, input, points of views and personal experiences. This sub is great for people who are curious as to get the other sides opinion and everyone should keep an open mind about changing their view on the matter. Now some last bit of advice for coaches and parents who put their kids in sports. PLEASE keep your eye out for the that one un-athletic kid who might not be the best on the team and make sure that his/her team mates understand this is a team event and that everyone is in this together. Some of these personal experiences shared with me shed some light on how people hated playing sports  and were being bulled because they were that kid and the other kids made them feel left out. Not all kids will be good athletes but you can teach your kids to respect one another, support one another and to ensure that they understand the unity of team work. If your kid is that ""all-star"" on the team then make them understand this most because the other kids will look to him/her to see how they treat the rest of the team. A good leader will understand this and this habit will grow with them, you just have to show them how and why. Thanks again for all the input, this is a great sub.","I did photography at a tennis event for some inner city 5th year kids. They're 10 years old and most of them had never heard of tennis. They all got a medal at the end regardless of placement because the idea was that playing tennis is fun, there's a tennis club near by and you should go because it'll help you keep fit. The model was to help solidify this message.","I'll start by saying that I agree with OP that a trophy for participating is absurd.  However, I think some form of acknowledgment for being in the league at all is cool.  I remember one  league I was in where every player received a patch with the league logo and the year.  It's fun to go back years later and see a physical reminder of the activities of your youth, especially if you're the type of kid who will never go on to play in a more competitive format.  I ended up playing college soccer, but I still like seeing my patches from when I was like 8 years old.

The one saving grace, I think, is that as long as there's a big, badass trophy for the winners and everyone else gets small, shitty trophies, any kid with even a little competition in his DNA will be pissed about the small trophy and want the big one, so I don't think it impacts the kids mentally as much as it impacts the parents who see the stupid symbolism.

I agree that it sets the wrong example, and I'd rather more parents had to have the conversation started by their kid saying, ""But why do *they* get a trophy?"" but it's probably not as bad as people like you and I think it is.",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a specific example of how giving all participants a medal at a tennis event for inner city kids helped reinforce the message that playing tennis is fun and can help keep them fit.

Reply A also emphasizes the importance of making sports enjoyable for kids, which may help the original poster see the value in participation trophies for younger children. On the other hand, Reply B agrees with the original poster that participation trophies are absurd, but also acknowledges the value of some form of acknowledgment for being in the league.

predict-explain,"growing up in america i was condition to believe women's breast are sexual organs do to the fact that we over sexualized them too much. it wasnt till recently that i came to conscious and started realizing that there is practically no way a woman's breast could be sexual organs. i mean obviously we men have breast too and our breast dont stimulate the opposite sex in any different way. and yes i'm well aware that during sex women could receive lots of stimulation through them in the act of foreplay. but so do other body parts, like the neck, the mouth, the foot, etc. lets also not forget that women do need their breast to breastfeed  their children, which this obviously screams out that they cant be sex organs.

anyways it seems like the more i try to believe this the more negative reactions i get from those around me. people here still insist that women's breast are sexual organs and the fact that women here in america, unlike women in africa or other countries in europe are still too afraid to go topless outside when its too hot kinda punctuates this believe. we also must forget that or government does believe they are sexual breast as it is against the law either way for women to go topless out in the streets. so i was wondering if this is correct that maybe you guys can then convince me that they are sexual organs. 

I also like to point out that i was watching that documentary [Free The Nipple](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2298394/) the other day on Netflix and it really touched me. i think it really is unfair that during heatwave days a man can take his shirt off in public yet women can't. i think we americans are too damn dramatic going judgmentally ballistic when we see boobs in public. at the same do to how we americans have been sexually conditioned since day one i'm actually amazed that there are women here who complain about not being able to go topless out in public. i thought that would of been the worst and most humiliating nightmare for an American woman.



ps= speaking of legal, not that i have anything against gay people or anything but i'm actually kinda surprised that today gay marriage is legal yet it's still illegal for women to go out topless in public.

Womens breasts act in a manner that a evolutionary biologist would call a fitness indicator. If you've ever noticed, all mammals have mammary glands (breasts), but in nearly all cases, the mammary glands are very small until pregnancy happens. Humans are different. Human men evolved to find women with larger breasts more attractive because they tend to be more fertile. This caused sexual selection in favor of larger breasts, which benefitted women with larger breasts, allowing genes for large breasts to spread throughout the population. This is why men are attracted to large breasts, and why women have them.

Then of course, you claim that they are not ""sexual organs."" The thing is, I don't know what that means. They sure as heck aren't genitals, but they definitely are secondary sex characteristics. A secondary sex characteristic is basically a trait that one gender possesses that the other sex doesn't, yet still doesn't benefit reproduction. For example: arm, body, leg, or facial hair in men, additional muscle in men, breasts in women.

Actually, muscle and athletic ability act as a fitness indicator for men in a similar way as breasts do in women, so why do we only sensor women's breasts?

Not trying to argue against you, just bring some extra info to the table :)","Women need a certain minimum amount of body fat in order to carry a pregnancy to term and then breastfeed the child. In fact, there is a hormonal regulation mechanism that pauses the menstrual cycle and makes the woman infertile if her body fat falls below a threshold.

In the environment of adaptation, people were more likely to be malnourished than fat, hence males evolved a sexual preference to avoid investing time and effort to mate with females that looked too skinny, and females evolved to ""advertise"" their body fat by storing it in places where it is most visible in an upright position: the breasts and the buttocks. Co-evolution between male sexual preferences and female body fat distribution created a feedback loop that reinforced these characteristics.

Therefore the vast majority of men are instinctively attracted to large breasts and round firm buttocks. It has nothing to do with ""over sexualization"", it's just biology. (Note that this is different than just being attracted to ""fat"" women, in fact men are generally not attracted to women with an excessive waist-to-hip ratio, which correlates with poor health).

As for the topless thing, social norms about clothing vary greatly between cultures: In some Islamic countries women often cover head to toe in large burqas, while in some Oceanian tribes people walk around almost naked, women wearing a simple skirt and men wearing only a penis sheath leaving their scrotum exposed.

Clearly, Western cultural norms about clothing are somewhere in between. If you want to argue for different norms then you need a stronger argument than just debating the ""sexualization"" of any given body part.",B,B,"I believe that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a detailed explanation rooted in evolutionary biology about the purpose of women's breasts and their role as a secondary sex characteristic. By explaining the biological reasons behind men's attraction to larger breasts and the evolutionary significance of body fat distribution, Reply B offers a compelling argument that challenges the original poster's belief that women's breasts are not sexual organs. 

Additionally, Reply B addresses the cultural aspect of clothing norms and the diversity of such norms across different societies, highlighting that societal views on nudity are not solely based on sexualization but are influenced by a variety of factors. This broader perspective on cultural norms and the biological basis of attraction adds depth to the discussion and provides a more nuanced understanding of the topic. 

Overall, Reply B's combination of biological explanations and cultural context makes it more likely to change the original poster's view by offering a comprehensive and well-supported argument."
predict-explain,"Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, is it looked down on and dismissed as anecdotal evidence for someone to share an experience of theirs? I quite enjoy listening to anecdotal evidence to get new perspectives I wouldn't have thought of or haven't heard before.

I understand that in an anecdotal case it is not scientific because it cannot be replicated and held to control standards, but I don't think this is grounds for dismissing the case as merely anecdotal and not worth mentioning. Am I wrong about this?

There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking anecdotal evidence into consideration, especially in a circumstance like asking someone you know their experience and opinion regarding a product that you are considering buying. There is absolutely valuable information that can be taken from anecdotal evidence.

The problem is when you come to an actual conclusion based on anecdotal evidence alone. We cannot logically come to any conclusions on something based on one observation. There is nothing to say that the results obtained were not outliers, or that they cannot be explained by something other than what we are looking at.

So, you aren't wrong in saying that we should not dismiss something because of anecdotal evidence, but if we are hoping to form a well thought out opinion on something, we really should require more than anecdotal evidence alone.

Most importantly, it should not be used to dismiss evidence that has been gathered scientifically, through numerous observations. There are exceptions to every rule, and we can't go around denying established rules or truths because we know of an exception. Your high functioning meth smoking cousin does not disprove the idea that meth is a destructive drug.

Now, that isn't to say that someone who wants to truly understand the effects of a drug like meth shouldn't take these individual cases into consideration, and attempt to understand what makes someone like your cousin (in this hypothetical case, obviously) able to function while most others cannot. It just means that they cannot use that lone case, or a few others like it, to disprove something that has been supported by far more evidence.","Anecdotal evidence is often associated with selection bias. I agree that in some cases, it is useful. Asking a user of the product what it's like doesn't introduce very much bias (although even then, you'd trust the average star rating of 1000 users over any individual review).

The problem is when you only hear about people who've had a certain type of experience. If you only listen to anecdotal accounts of whether prayer works, for example, then you'll get a very biased view, because nobody likes to talk about times when prayer didn't work.

There are ways to get around this, of course, but most of the time, if you're listening to anecdotal data, you're not trying to debias it, or weighing it properly; so it tends to have a disproportionate effect on your thinking.",A,A,"I would say Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A acknowledges the value of anecdotal evidence but also highlights the limitations of relying solely on anecdotal evidence to form conclusions. It emphasizes the importance of considering multiple sources of evidence and not dismissing scientific evidence in favor of anecdotal evidence. 

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the potential biases and limitations of anecdotal evidence, which may come across as more critical and less open to considering the value of anecdotal evidence. 

Overall, Reply A presents a more balanced and nuanced perspective on the issue, which may be more likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially change their view on the topic."
predict-explain,"First lets make a couple of things clear: I do not necessarily believe that government spying on its own citizens is ok, and thats not what this post is about. This post is about the following:

Often times someone might make the argument ""if you're not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about"" defending government collection of data. To counter people will bring up the ""bathroom lock"" analogy: We all lock the door when we go to the bathroom even though what we're doing is not inherently wrong.

My problem with this is that it is actually arguable that bathroom locks are an analogy in FAVOUR of ""government back doors"". Most bathroom locks are not designed to keep intruders out - they are designed to make sure someone doesn't accidentally walk in on you. But in fact it is common to see in bathroom locks a very simple unlocking mechanism - one that can be unlocked simply by pressing a bobby pin in the hole. This is put in place with safety in mind - if something happens to you while you're in the bathroom someone can get in and save you without breaking down the door. I don't know about you, but this is something that comforts me.

In the same way that no one wants to see me shit and would only actually use this ""backdoor"" through the bathroom lock in emergencies, the government doesn't care about my email to my mom about my sisters birthday, and only actually use collected data when it might be of some help fighting terrorism.


When I noticed this I couldn't think about any reason why what I have said above is wrong, so please, CMV.

Nobody really has a problem with targeted surveillance.  If the government has a warrant to search your house or listen to your phone calls, they can do so.  But getting a warrant requires individualized probable cause to believe that you have committed a crime.

In the analogy, using a pin to open the door is an action that is only taken in extremis to violate the privacy of the occupant for some more important purpose.  Likewise, the government should only use its surveillance powers to violate privacy when there is a strong reason to target the particular person(s) being surveilled.","If someone uses the ""backdoor"" to my bathroom lock, I both know about it when it happens, and have, presumably, consented to it, and it is being done for my best interests.

Government surveillance is done in secret. We can't review their behaviour to ensure it is in line with our values and interests. Nor is it done with consent, even in the larger sense of requiring a warrant granted in open and public court.

Most importantly, it is not done in our best interests. A bathroom may be breached if the occupant is having a heart attack, but there is absolutely no danger to me from my own communications.",B,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B effectively points out the key differences between using a ""backdoor"" in a bathroom lock and government surveillance. It highlights the importance of consent, transparency, and the potential for abuse in government surveillance, which are not present in the scenario of using a pin to open a bathroom lock in case of emergency. Additionally, Reply B emphasizes that government surveillance is not necessarily done in the best interests of the individual, unlike using a backdoor in a bathroom lock for emergency situations.

Overall, Reply B provides a more compelling argument against the original poster's comparison and raises important ethical and privacy concerns related to government surveillance."
predict-explain,"To say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental physiological differences between men and women that feminists appear to disregard. Now, in my opinion feminism seeks to advocate that anything that men can do, women can also but only when its convenient. To me it seems like feminists want to have their cake and eat it too. I will give a few examples that I always think about to illustrate my point.

1. The Ray Rice incident. What happened was unfortunate and of course he shouldn't have hit his wife. However, if this was Ray hanging out with another football player and knocked him out, this would not have been a story. Its because he punched a woman that this became a big deal. How can the feminist movement suggest ""Men should NEVER lay their hands on a woman"" but still say that men and women are equal. My answer is that its because men are generally stronger than women, but then that's my point. If you are going to advocate that they are equal then they should receive equal treatment. Again, CMV.

2. Rape cases. In college I have been required to watch numerous sexual harassment videos and attend mandatory training seminars on sexual assault. In these videos they always paint the male as a bad guy and its always targeted towards men. Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges. Why is this on the guy? People use the phrase ""Victim Blaming"" and say that its not on the girl regardless of the fact that she drunk. So what if she had gotten drunk and drove her car into a tree. Can she then say ""Maybe that wasn't a good idea"" and then get off the hook?

3. The draft. This one has also bothered me. According to the United States Selective Service Act, all men between ages 18-25 are required to register for the draft and may be picked for military service if the draft were to be implemented. Why are feminists all over the country not outraged about this? Shouldn't it be men AND women that are required to register for the draft? After all, men and women should be able to perform wartime duties equally right? It just seems like people pick and choose when its convenient for gender equality

Of course there are certain things that should be equal. Wages, education, etc. However I feel that a push for gender equality in every aspect of life is fundamentally wrong. CMV!

Imagine this scenario: You give two little kids ice cream cones. The first one drops theirs before getting to take a bite. To make it fair and equal, you decide to knock second kid's cone to the ground. WTF? Why would you do that? Why would you chose to make the situation worse for either kid?

Along that line of thinking, it makes zero sense to advocate for it being okay to hit women or for women needing to register for the draft or to try to revoke the idea that a woman being drunk does not allow for consent. The vast majority of feminists think the draft is wrong, that consent is mutual, and that it is wrong for anyone to hit anyone. But, being feminists, their focus is on womens issues and the issues you describe above are really mens issues - men should not be hit, men cannot consent while drunk, men should not have to register for the draft. That's not to say that feminists don't care about mens issues, but it isn't their main focus. Complaining about that is like complaining that because you support a local food pantry you don't care about starving children in third world countries. You can care about both problems.","To be honest, I don't think there is a good answer to this one that doesn't ultimately boil down to having the cake and eating it too. The only thing that really makes sense as a response to this is that feminism is, at it's core, about advancing women's issues. The logical framework for advancing that idea is that everyone should be equal, but it is about making progress on issues where women are disadvantaged in some way to men, so your 3rd point isn't all that relevant; feminists might agree, in theory, that there are some areas where men are disadvantaged but they are not going to advocate for those issues to any noticeable extent because that isn't what the movement is about. You have to remember that feminism has a very large political/agend-ized component to it and the ultimate goal isn't to be as ideologically consistent as possible with regards to ""equality"", which is why you don't see feminists going to bat for ""men's rights"" issues. There is a reason why many feminists prefer to be called feminist than egalitarian; the focus is on women's issues.",B,B,"I believe that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A effectively uses a simple analogy to explain the concept of equality without making things worse for one gender in order to make things equal. It addresses the concerns raised by the original poster and explains why feminism focuses on women's issues without neglecting men's issues entirely. The analogy of the ice cream cones helps to illustrate the point that advocating for gender equality does not mean making things worse for one gender to balance things out. 

On the other hand, Reply B acknowledges that feminism primarily focuses on advancing women's issues and may not advocate for men's issues to the same extent. While this is a valid point, it does not directly address the concerns raised by the original poster or provide a clear explanation of why feminism may not address certain men's issues. 

Overall, Reply A provides a more compelling argument and offers a more straightforward and relatable explanation of the concept of equality without making things worse for one gender."
predict-explain,"Greetings!

I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay.

However, as far as my understanding of History goes, Humanity kept uniting into bigger and bigger groups.

I'm not sure whether my order is correct, but it's merely to give an example of what I am seeing.

First, families started working together as it was easier to hunt that way  
Then, they started to form small tribal communities  
Then, these tribal communities united into alliances and ""great tribes""  
Then, the tribes became petty kingdoms  
Then, the petty kingdoms were either swallowed by a larger one, or swallowed the smaller ones.  
Then, the kingdoms they formed kept absorbing the smaller communities that were similar in culture

And then there are countries like the United States and Russia, both spanning almost entire continents or more. Likewise, they have the strongest presence as well. The United Kingdom had an equally great presence during its Imperial days, which it more or less managed to retain.

I feel Europe could easily raise its economy to the third power if each current country paid its tax to a single, central government that viewed each part of the union equally, at most... with different strategies, investiture focuses.

The main counter arguement I see against an united Europe is cultural decay or incompatibility, but I do not understand how it would get in the way too much. Culture won't disappear just because people answer to a single elected government, neither will it disappear due to people wandering within the borders.

you can't do the same for Europe where everything is completely different - money/currency, religions, general lifestyle.

it's also worth noting that having an EU passport means that you can go to those countries with no problems - so it is effectively like one large community anyway, and realistically, has no benefits in changing into an official 'mono-country' effectively.","It's worth mentioning that both USA and Russia were taken by force through an era of imperialism.  You are suggesting that countries opt in.  This method - while more civil and required by our modern day, global society - is unlikely to bear fruit.

&gt;  The main counter arguement I see against an united Europe is cultural decay or incompatibility, but I do not understand how it would get in the way too much. 

**Language**: [Europe has many languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe).  This is an especially large problem when dealing with the law where interpretation of a given case, statement or law is the difference between success and failure.  So if only for the most basic reasons, if you have one country, you need one language to be the primary one.  Which one would it be?  

**Social programs**: Any standard that any country currently set for their social programs is a carefully calibrated balance between what they're willing to spend and who they will spend it on. This means that once the countries are united, *everyone* needs to eliminate their social programs and start over with a much larger country in mind.  This will be *fantastic* for the poor countries that have little to no social safety net.  But this will mean that the bar will be significantly lowered for more lucrative countries.  

**Political Parties**: Each country has it's own political preference.  But more than that, the political systems are not even set up to mean the same things.  So to me, the French Socialist party might seem a lot like the Swedish Social Democrats, but they might be vastly different.  Or the current prime minister of Finland is of the National Coalition Party	, but outside of Finland, it doesn't really exist.  The point that I'm making is that there is no way for anyone to feel represented in government if they will almost certainly have to give up the type of leadership that they voted for and want.

I could go on, but the picture looks the same across the board.  Any country with something to lose wouldn't want to lose it.  Instead, a separate union similar to the European Union makes sense.  EU has their standards for grouping countries and after the third bailout with Greece, it's unlikely that they will be changing their minds.  So, a separate union for smaller countries would be an incredible point of financial leverage.

The two trends are that seem to be increasing relentlously are college tuition costs and percentage of people attending college, I blame the system for this, not the individuals, as the U.S. moves further away from manufacturing, the need for college educating people in our work force increases, there are less and less jobs available that *don't* require college.

(1) Life change substantially over the course of 18 years.  Specifically the 18 years between when a person becomes a parent and when their child is old enough to go to college tend to be the formative years of their career.  So while the average grad student cannot afford their child's college education *now* it doesn't mean that they will be unable to do so when the time comes.

(2) You've *falsely* equated college to success or financial independence.  At least speaking on behalf of the US, college is showing to be decreasingly useful in terms of providing a life of stability and financial prosperity.  Instead, the unfilled skilled labor jobs are now showing themselves to be the path to upward mobility.  This includes plumbing, mechanics, heating/cooling, etc.  Not to mention that even within the white collar world, entrepreneurs and programmers *often* look down on college grads as being lazy, entitled and unambitious.  


College is good for a person who's already in the middle class and wants to stay there without so much effort.  But that's not where most of America is today.  The middle class is quickly disappearing.","I think your Idea is flawed from the beginning.

1) College/University is an option not mandatory. Add to that, Post Secondary Education is becoming less and less important. I don't think that it will ever go away, but I think the way we look at College is going to change over the next few decades (this is obviously an opinion).

2) Paying for college should be the students responsibility. I did it on my own, just as millions of other have done it. With literally 0 help from my family, because they could not financially afford it. I worked 2 jobs, fixed iPhone's, and studied my ass off to graduate. But I did it. I was financially independent by the time I was 14. My parents haven't paid for anything except a home and food until I was 22 and moved out. I commend any parent that can help their child pay for a higher education. But it's not reasonable to expect a free ride.

The idea that your parents are responsible for paying for your education is misguided and selfish. You should work hard just like your parents did to pay for their educations and everything they have. Don't be lazy, don't expect hand outs, they don't come to you in the real life. If you want something, work for. Hustle, do what ever it takes to pay the bills. If your not willing to do that, you can't blame anyone but yourself.",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A addresses the original poster's concerns by pointing out that the value of a college education is not as clear-cut as it may seem. They provide examples of alternative paths to success and financial stability that do not require a college degree. This challenges the original poster's assumption that college is a necessary and essential investment for future success. Additionally, Reply A highlights the changing nature of work and the economy, suggesting that the traditional view of college as a ticket to success may not hold true in the future. 

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on personal responsibility and work ethic, which may not directly address the original poster's concerns about the increasing cost of college tuition and the pressure on future generations to go to college. While Reply B's message of personal responsibility is important, it may not be as effective in changing the original poster's view on the broader issues surrounding college education and its affordability."

First Amendment

Cops can tell you what to say, taze you for arguing with them, arrest journalists, and arrest you for filming them. They can break up peaceful protests by force. They bring assault weapons to memorial services and gay rights marches and anti-war demonstrations.

[Here](http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/tag/journalist-arrested) are some stories about arrests of journalists.

Second Amendment

Most states don't seem to have tried to take your guns away, but that won't stop them from arming the police with military weapons. If the police attack you, where can you go for help? Why are the (civilian) police forces authorized to carry weapons which are illegal in the states they police? Do police really get into gunfights with heavily armed drug dealers and save the lives of crowds of law abiding citizens, like something out of a 1980's cop thriller?

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarization_of_police) is the wiki about police militarization.

Fourth Amendment

Cops can seize your property without cause or warrant (civil forfeiture), and search your car, phone, or house without cause or warrant. Don't believe me? Look it up. Multiple recent court decisions defend an officer's wish to do whatever he wants with your things.

[Here](http://www.mintpressnews.com/supreme-court-rules-police-do-not-need-a-warrant-to-search-your-home/206199/) is an article about the most recent supreme court decision on searches.

[This](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;rlz=1C1ASUC_enUS632US632&amp;es_sm=93&amp;q=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;oq=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0j0i22i30l9.269565.274940.0.275095.27.25.0.0.0.0.299.3358.0j18j2.20.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..7.20.3353.s4Q1aX2iVQY) is just a google page, but how many of these wrong house, no knock searches are too many?

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States) is the wiki about civil forfeiture.

It appears the court has ruled that police -do- need a warrant to search your cell phone.

Fifth Amendment

Cops can arrest you on the spot for literally anything they see fit, and you will be held -at least- until your bail hearing, and you will be lucky if you can afford your bail. Also, they can compel you through whatever means they see fit (lying, threatening, depriving of basic needs, torture) to bear testimony against yourself, even if you are innocent (any testimony given under duress is admissible to the court, and usually leads to conviction regardless of proof-of-guilt). Also, they fund their own departments by issuing citations and stealing property (seriously, if you haven't looked up civil forfeiture, do it now).

[Here](https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1656) is a good video where a Virginia Beach officer explains criminal 'interviews.' If you have time to really watch this, please listen to what he says, and how he says it. His job is to look for wrongdoing, and he freely admits that if he wants to pull someone over, he can follow them until they do something he can pull them over for. [This](https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1881) is where he starts to describe interrogation specifically.

Sixth Amendment

You can be kept in jail for years before you are brought before a judge, and can expect no help or information from the prison guards. Guards are there to keep people in, not to save lives. Numerous cases are rising to the public view regarding prison conditions, and maybe we should start throwing the 'cruel and unusual' term around. Either way, in 2011, about 3 people died in American jails -every day- with countless others tortured or left off the books (think Chicago's interrogation fiasco this year, or Guantanamo).

[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site) is an article about Chicago's secret prison.

[Here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/08/how-many-police-shootings-a-year-no-one-knows/) is an article about police killings. Note the fact that they aren't even tracked very carefully.

[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/27/deaths-in-jails-885-inmates) is an article about deaths in prisons. Again, information is out of date, and possibly inaccurate.

Eighth Amendment

Some Judges set reasonable bail, others do not. Some of the Judges caught setting unreasonable bail are called out, or disciplined, most are not. Chances are very good you will not be able to afford bail if you go inside. Think about that next time you're tempted to flip off a police officer.

I'm having a hard time finding specifics about the time between an arrest and a bail hearing, but pages I visit says it varies state by state, with multiple lawyers giving anecdotes of people waiting up to a year in jail before being -acquitted- because they couldn't make bail. Personally, I have known more than one person to spend months in jail after being unable to afford bail. Whether or not someone is found guilty, shouldn't this be viewed as a violation of our right to a speedy trial? Not sure about that one.

[Here](http://www.bjs.gov/content/dcf/ptrpa.cfm) are some statistics on drug bail.

[Here](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/bailfail_executive_summary.pdf) is a document full of prison statistics, most relevantly, bail rates.

Bottom line:

You don't have rights anymore. Each of the constitutional rights we have were set forth by Americans to protect their families from overzealous government officials. These rights are not there to protect you from your neighbors. They aren't there to protect you from your employer. They were written specifically to protect you from the Government, and they have failed. Remember your history, read the constitution. Every one of the rights Americans hold dear is being violated by police, judges, and politicians every day. Every Day. EVERY DAY. Every bullshit arrest, every bullshit sentence, every bullshit traffic stop, every bullshit roadside search. If you try to exercise your right to free speech, you can be stopped for it. If you argue with the officer, he will pull you out of the car for an arrest and search without warrant. If you resist him in any way, or if you can't hear him, or if you step on the brake pedal by mistake, or if you just don't fall on your face quickly enough, he will shoot you. Those are the facts.

Every year, another generation of high-school students reads 1984, by Orwell. They tell us what to buy, and at what price (medicine, insurance). They tell us our wars are moral, or economically sound. They tell us who to love (media, soldiers, 'heros'). They tell us who to hate (war, media, socialists, WBC). We are in a constant state of war on at least one front (Germany, Vietnam, Korea, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, Russia, Mexico, and God only knows where else). They lie to us, and suppress anyone looking for the truth (media, arrest of journalists, denying the right to assemble or film officers). They tell us what to believe. They tell us how to behave. They will kill you if you do not fall in line exactly when and how they tell you.

It might not look like you live in a police state. After all, you can drive to work, do your job, buy your groceries, and go on vacation. However, if a police officer, a judge, or anyone else has the authority to ignore the Constitution of the United States of America, what else can you call it? Do I need to dare you to piss off a cop? If you know what will happen when you piss off a cop, how can you accept that? Why are police even authorized to use deadly force? You really want them to kill someone for speeding? Well what about stealing your car, can we kill them then? How many lives are saved through the use of deadly force? Is it worth it?

Well it isn't worth it to me. I'm going to keep my head down until I can afford to get the Hell out of here. I'd rather Live as a citizen of the World than Die as a citizen of this country.

If you think the constitution protects you (at all), think again. They are walking all over your rights, and you aren't going to notice until they arrest you, or kill your children. If they never do, you will live your life among the sheeple, waiting for the law to tell you how to live.

I'm sorry if this comes across as somewhat belligerent, but I believe the seriousness of the situation in this country isn't exactly sinking in for the general public. Am I wrong? Is it already getting better? Are citizens safer than they used to be? Is my information wrong or biased? I would love a discussion about what we are doing right, what we are doing wrong, and what we can do next.

Well there are several things wrong with your points.
1) Civil Forfeiture is still bound by the normal judiciary system. You can in fact get your money back, although most don't. Civil forfeiture is also only used in the case of individuals carrying large amounts of cash, and that of course is the asset most commonly linked to criminal activity. It would be harder to sizes and easier to win back non cash assets.
2) police have always broken up protests that don't have a permit or occur in non designated areas. This isn't characteristic of a police state by itself. This has gone on in New York since the 1800s, it's nothing new. While current restrictions of protests to limited areas may reduce the impacts protests may have, they are orders of magnitude less harsh than common measures in police states.
3) bail is as high as it is because it is the cost te state would have to pay a bounty hunter to bring you back. Obviously this is quite expensive, and disproportionately impacts poor people, but there's a quite logical reason why this system exists. This system was not implemented as part of some nefarious plot, it is just a holdover from the olden days, the very earliest days of the country. That also proves that bail requirements are constitutional, our founders approved of them and wrote them into las. Fact is poor people have never been able to afford bail for major crimes,the current situation is the same as it always was. 
4) testimony obtained under duress is not admissible in court. Also if an officer frequently arrests people without cause he will be disiplined by his department. 
5) officers are allowed to arrest and or search people without warrants, such are arrests or searches must be based on the officers reasonable suspecion that the person in question is a criminal. I mean if I was walking down the street in NYC smoking crack, if the cop had to go back and get a warrant he would never be able to find me again. Of course  many cases are less clear cut then this, especially the searches, but it's necessary for the police to have these powers in order for them to properly persecute criminals. 
5) I think your primary problem though is scale. Sure the United States might be more repressive then some other democracies, but is it a police state? Of course not, you hear varied political views on TV, we are allowed to discuss public policy on the internet or in the street, I can oppose the government without fear of being disappeared. If the US was a police state far more dissidents would disappear every year, and political freedoms would be da more restricted.","&gt;Cops can tell you what to say, taze you for arguing with them, arrest journalists, and arrest you for filming them. They can break up peaceful protests by force. They bring assault weapons to memorial services and gay rights marches and anti-war demonstrations.  
  
I don't know what you are referring to when you say cops can tell you what to say. Yes, the police are able to use non lethal techniques to protect themselves and others when people act belligerently and dangerously. I see no evidence of this being abused on a scale that would even sniff at the possibility of the US being considered a police state by any definition. Same for the peaceful protests, there might be a news article or two that I bet you could dig up about this happening. Police having weapons on hand during large gatherings is not at all unusual. Until they use them to point at people who are otherwise peaceful, you have no argument.  
  
Your argument under the heading ""Second Amendment"" is not an argument, just a few rhetorical questions. You even admit, rightfully, that there has been almost no major legislative action regarding guns in recent memory. The second amendment does not talk about what weapons the police or military should or should not have.

&gt;Cops can seize your property without cause or warrant (civil forfeiture), and search your car, phone, or house without cause or warrant. Don't believe me? Look it up. Multiple recent court decisions defend an officer's wish to do whatever he wants with your things.  
  
Civil forfeiture does require cause and a hearing in court. There are well recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement and if anything, court decisions are breaking against the state. Vehicle tracking devices and cell phone searches being chief among them. See: United States v Jones and Riley v California. If you have other cases in mind that support your point, please cite them.  
  
&gt;Cops can arrest you on the spot for literally anything they see fit, and you will be held -at least- until your bail hearing, and you will be lucky if you can afford your bail. Also, they can compel you through whatever means they see fit (lying, threatening, depriving of basic needs, torture) to bear testimony against yourself, even if you are innocent (any testimony given under duress is admissible to the court, and usually leads to conviction regardless of proof-of-guilt). Also, they fund their own departments by issuing citations and stealing property (seriously, if you haven't looked up civil forfeiture, do it now).  
  
Police officers are only legally authorized to execute an arrest if there has been a warrant issued or they have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and this person committed it. The bail hearing, or arraignment, typically happens within 24-48 hours of the arrest. The judge will hear about the facts and circumstances surrounding the arrest and has the power to set the defendant free if the state cannot produce sufficient evidence justifying the arrest. Then, this addresses your next section as well, sets bail. If bail is unreasonably high for the defendant, it can be reduced and commonly is. Judges don't want to keep people locked up if they don't have to, at least for the most part. State judges are elected officials after all. The bottom line is that cops and prosecutors don't have the time or resources to make bad arrests or bring bad cases to a jury. That's why most arrests are the result of a long investigative process where the evidence is in place and a judge signs an arrest warrant. Cops making an arrest on the street is usually because the crime happens right in front of them or several people tell them person A was running from the store that was just robbed.  
  
The true bottom line is that you are failing victim to the media you seem to want to warn everyone else about. Across the US, crime is at historically low levels and getting lower. Internationally, there are fewer wars involving less people than at any other time in world history. The modern media spends a inordinate amount of time reporting on violence and war that makes it seem like nothing else is going on. Yes, this year, 2015, has featured several national news stories involving allegations of police misconduct that resulted in people dying. They are all tragedies and I hope that police departments across the country learn from the mistakes made in those situations. What almost never gets reported is the boring, routine, everyday police work that accounts for 99% of the police/public interactions. Such stories don't sell. Yes there is abuse in the system. It is hopefully routed out and eliminated. This idea that we're going to someday find ourselves in a perfect world is a pipe dream.  
  
So to answer your final set of questions, yes, you are delusional. That's because you likely consume mostly main stream news media that lives and breathes on sensationalism. Your information has not been shared with us, however, so this is just my best guess. Citizens are safer now than we have ever been, violent crime is [down](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/10/us-usa-crime-fbi-idUSKCN0IU1UM20141110).",B,A,"I would say that reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more detailed and structured rebuttal to the original post, addressing each point made by the OP and providing counterarguments and explanations. The response also offers examples and references to support their points, showing a deeper understanding of the issues at hand. 

On the other hand, reply A seems to be more dismissive and lacks the same level of depth and explanation as reply B. It does not address each point made by the OP as thoroughly and does not provide as much evidence to support its arguments. 

Overall, reply B presents a more coherent and well-reasoned argument, making it more likely to change the OP's view."
predict-explain,"For the purpose of this post, I am defining ""capitalism"" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. ""Socialism"" is defined as a system in which the government owns the means of production, and distributes all things necessary for decent quality of life (food, water, shelter, education, health care, etc) for free to all minors and any adult either working, seeking work, or enrolled in school. I understand that this definition is more specific than the true definition of socialism, but I want to preempt any arguments suggesting that people won't look for work if everything is provided for them anyway; they won't be provided for unless they contribute. Also, please note that I am not advocating any specific system of governance; I don't want a debate about the merits of direct democracy. Assume that the system of governance is something effective and relatively democratic, unless there is a compelling reason why my definition of socialism ensures ineffective government.

With that out of the way, here is my justification. I believe that capitalism ensures exploitation of the lower-classes. The winners in a capitalist system are nearly always those who were born into relative wealth already. Even the rags-to-riches stories of our time, such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, they were all born into at least lower-middle class. Those trapped in poverty are normal people, who usually work much harder than the people at the top, and get nothing for it. I don't mean to put down high-ranking executives, or other wealthy individuals, but I think that if capitalism is designed to benefit those who work hard, it's doing a shoddy job. Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair.

And that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.

Not only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a ""Green!"" or ""Eco-Friendly"" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot). 

So, with those reasons put out for why capitalism is bad, here's why I think socialism is better. Socialism prevents needless death and suffering by ensuring that everyone who contributes gets everything they need for a healthy life. Socialism ends cyclical poverty by giving everyone a chance at education, without worries about putting food on the table. Socialism is better for rewarding the hard-workers and punishing the slackers, because without unfair head starts going to rich kids entering the workforce, the real cream will rise to the top (there would be variable wages and such; the government employers could offer raises and promotions to their best workers). Socialism is better for the environment, because the government could have direct control, and would have much more incentive to manage the environment in sustainable ways than short-term-minded corporations.

I guess I can go further in depth in my replies, if needed. I'm looking for a good debate, and maybe a change of heart. Change my view!

EDIT: OK all, so I have been persuaded by a combination of factors that socialism as I define it is not as good as capitalism with generous welfare policies and heavy regulations (think Nordic model). I'll be giving out deltas now. I will continue debating as well, but I think I'm done for now. I will resume later.

That sounds great in principle, but how do you determine whether someone deserves government support? There are so many loop-holes that closing all of them is nearly impossible without imposing unreasonable regulations on what is an acceptable life-style. 

I could easily enroll in a low-tier community college, pick low-work major, sign up for the minimum hours to be a full-time student, and pass all my classes without attending them and with no more than an hour or two or work a week. I could probably do this for 8 years before I graduated. Meanwhile, I could sit and browse reddit all day. Should I be getting all your socialist benefits?

Alternatively, suppose I want to go into some exotic profession like streaming video games. There are hundreds of people out there that end up making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year by streaming because they have built up a viewer-base of tens of thousands of people. But to get that viewerbase, you need to constantly be producing content, and the process of acquiring viewers is very slow and it took ages for many of the popular streamers to get above a dozen people tuning in. How do you differentiate between someone who sits and plays video games all day verses the next pro-gamer that will entertain a hundred thousand viewers a day?

What if I want to go out and make the new app that sells millions of copies? How long can I come out with unsuccessful flappy-birds until your system stops supporting me?

And about that person seeking work... they have a nice resume, went and got themselves a good degree, have some experience, but no one is hiring them. Their personality is simply terrible and no one wants to work with them. Then what? 

I do not believe that socialism is fundamentally wrong, but you can't just provide everyone's basic needs if they are ""productive members of society"" without some serious problems arising. 

People are very much inherently lazy and many already do the minimum they need to not get fired. When you give them a socialist safety blanket, they will continue to do the minimum they need to keep it. If you want to advocate such an extreme form of socialism (what you suggested is much more extreme than what any socialist country right now has), your system is doomed to fail until you find some way of closing pretty much every loophole of how you trick the system. How do you hope to do that?","*Note: I don't have a lot of information on your whole post, but on the economics side.

&gt;And that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve.

Acually global starvation levels have plummeted since China under Dang Xiapeng went through a capitalistic switch in economic thinking,  more than 500M chinness people have enterned the middle class while the rest are being lifted up.

&gt;Clical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.

Well what you see as faluires other countries see as success example look at China pre Deng Xiaoping and how 60m-70m people starved to death and this is a country that has a larger landmass than the US and has very good farm land, the government organized farmers in antempt to bring people out of poverty the end solution was 60m-70m died due to starvation.


This graph shows the best, in 1978/1979 China Privitized it's farms and they went to a market based system lifting 100s of millions of people out of poverty and into the middle class.(look at this graph: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Prc1952-2005gdp.gif)


Other countries have followed suit to achieve the same success and what is needed to fund this growth in the economy when you aren't as devolped........child labour every country did it from England, USA, to Canada
To say it's only capitalist flaw, that's wrong the Soviet Union had it, Anceint Egypt, North Korea, and many more none capitalistic countries, whenever you have quick growth starting from the bottom everyone works from 5 year olds to 80 year olds.


Capitalism has produced the richest ""People"" in the world record number of people are not starving to death more people are going to schools and are getting treated in hospitals, even some illness that killed millions a 100 hundred years ago has been cured due to capital in the market place.﻿

Theses countries are devolping just like we did 100 years ago and they are going to go through the same things and no one will be able to stop them, look at polls done in China in the 1990s about if their better off know the numbers were in the 90% agreeing they had a better life currently.

predict-explain,"Hey CMV, I'll keep this one simple. I believe that if someone is willing to forcefully take from another innocent person with the threatening use of a knife, gun, or other easily lethal weapon, they have no place in society and have a fundamental defect in their human brain chemistry (without even touching on the trauma and psychological damage the victims must suffer).
To me, this type of crime shows an extreme amount of depravity. You're brandishing a weapon, ready to kill a person you do not even know, for short term profit. This especially applies to home invasions and store robberies.
The reason I added the 'positively identified' caveat is that I don't want to leave any room for putting an innocent person to death, so for this case to kick in, I would need either CCTV confirming their identity, or multiple eye witnesses confirming their identity. 
I'm willing to admit this view may be on the extreme side, but I like to think I'm a reasonable person and I'm open to change. So reddit, please CMV.

**EDIT: I should have clarified, please assume LOADED weapons or a knife, and the offender is NOT a juvenile. To me, these are different cases and do not deserve the death penalty.**

There's not a correlation between crime rates dropping in areas where the severity of punishment is harsher. For example, in Texas, the death penalty is present, but it doesn't stop people from murdering other people. Another example: in the top 20 states with murders per 100,000 people, or rather, in the top 20 worst states for murder rates, only 5 do not have the death penalty. In the top 20 states with the LOWEST murder rates, 12/20 do NOT have the death penalty. It can be argued that punishment is not a detractor of criminal behavior.

2. As a personal anecdote, my apartment was broken into when I was just a year out of college. My girlfriend at the time came home to find the house had been broken into and apparently the people had just left. She went upstairs and found a knife from our kitchen, upstairs in our bedroom. So the robber had broken in, taken the knife from our kitchen and brought it upstairs with him in case he met anyone up there, I guess. But who is to say his intent? Was it scary as shit? YES. Did it make me feel very unsafe in my home? YES. But I also know that some robbers carry weapons solely for personal protection and not to actively harm people. Some robbers take them and use them to scare or intimidate people. Who is to say that it was ever their intention to use it on someone? Seems a pretty stiff penalty to give someone the death penalty when you could never truly know their intentions or if they would have gone through with it.

Edits made for spelling, punctuation and just generally awful flow of the paragraphs. Hopefully most have been caught and ~~killed~~ I mean, uh... fixed.","It doesn't seem like the moral arguments are changing your mind, so I'll try taking a different approach. The death penalty for armed robberies would be insanely, unrealistically expensive.  Death penalty cases cost way more than even life in prison, because we want to be really really sure we're right before we execute someone.

Last year, according to the FBI, there were about 345,454 armed robberies in the US.  The actual costs of a death penalty case vary, but somewhere around $1,000,000 seems like a pretty common estimate.  So, in a year, we're looking at about $345,454,000,000.  Is that really worth it?  Are the benefits (reduced crime rate, comfort to the victims...) really worth the 300 BILLION dollar price tag?  Who's paying for that?  Is that really the best use of the money?

Morality aside (and for the record, I'm very morally against it), death penalty for armed robbery would just be too expensive.

http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty",B,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because reply B brings up a practical and logistical concern regarding the implementation of the death penalty for armed robberies - the cost. By highlighting the exorbitant cost associated with death penalty cases and the sheer number of armed robberies that occur in the US, reply B effectively argues that the financial burden of implementing the death penalty in these cases would be unsustainable. This pragmatic argument may resonate more with the original poster and lead them to reconsider their stance on the issue."
predict-explain,"First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that even many of the violent criminals who are jailed don't need to be locked up for as long to prevent them from being an immediate or persistent threat. In fact, I believe that long term incarceration under harsh conditions is something which actually causes further social harm – directly to the person incarcerated and to the society which the prisoner will be released into after an extended period of incarceration. Also, if the person has dependents, they too might suffer more if their material needs are not adequately provided for.

Subsequently, if some sort of punishment is required for violating some sort of socially accepted institution, then I feel that some form of shaming, shunning, and exile are possibly effective alternatives to prevent crime before we decide to incarcerate someone for an extended period of time or issue fines which they may not be able to pay.

One advantage to this approach is that the punishment is more directly democratic. It's not a punishment which is wholly issued by a sitting judge who is appointed to represent the public and who arbitrarily decides a perpetrator's fate. Rather, the perpetrator, by agreeing to make public their offense, can still receive a certain degree of sympathy and forgiveness. And if they are shunned or exiled (for some indeterminate amount of time), then other members of the public can go along with that punishment to a degree they see fit.

Granted, with shunning or exile the punishment would work much better with social cohesion, but if it were the accepted form of punishment then shunning or exile might be more readily accepted and enforced by the general population of an area. Admittedly, this is an aspect of society which would probably have to be reformed or evolve if a society chose to move away from incarceration, corporal punishment, and excessive fines. But if society is incapable of changing in this way... then I'm not sure society would be able to change in other ways which would make it sustainable and tolerable to live within.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","The problem with both the prison-industrial complex and your proposed solution is that both are guitly of kicking the can down the road: the punitive encarceration of people who break the law often leads them to be *less* able to rejoin society and to change course from a life of criminality. This is caused by institutionalization, things like long-term isolation, being victimized sexually, physically, and mentally while an inmate, and especially the restrictions and difficulties which newly released ex-cons have to face.

It's very difficult for an ex-con to get a job and a place to live in, *especially* in an area that is reasonable and which doesn't have lots fo crime. So they get stuck in a shitty job working for the minimum wage, most likely living in a shitty neighborhood where they may be exposed to crime. It's basically a recipe for failure. If you got busted for drug dealing then you're stuck working in a factory making no money and being treated like shit, wouldn't you want to go back to selling drugs so that you could make a reasonable living in a n occupation that doesn't require a clean criminal history?

But you already know this.

The problem with your idea of public shaming and exile is similar. People are publicly humiliated for the crimes they commit, so *everybody* in the community knows about what they have done. They will essentially be outcast, just like an ex-con in the example above. This will lead to more criminality as well.

And as for exile? Well, if that ain't the worst kind of kicking the can down the road then I don't know what is. Pushing criminals out of your community into someone else's is terrible NIMBYism. Exiles will likely end up gravitating into what amounts to a social leper colony. There's no jobs, there's no way to contribute to society, there's only other criminals around you who are all just as down on their luck. That sounds like a college for criminal learning and a recipe for creating gangs.

So what are these two alternatives really missing? 

Well, I've already explained the problem of not having a rehabilitative goal for incarceration or exile. And that's a huge problem. Another problem is that there's no restorative justice &amp;mdash; a person burns down a building then gets kicked out of society. What good does that do for the person she is left with a smouldering foundation? It's better to put the guilty party to work *rebuilding* what they burned down because then they have to face the consequences of their actions and they have to face up to the building's owner and the hardships that their actions have visited on this person.

The other problem with exile is that &amp;mdash; and I truly believe this &amp;mdash; there are some people who are not capable of rehabilitation. It isn't many people, but there is some small slice of the population which are unrepentant psychopaths and child molesters. Basically they *need* to stay in a place where they can't cause more damage to society. That doesn't mean locking them up in a dungeon or in permanent solitary confinement, but by the same token exiling them would condemn another community to go through the same horrors as yours did.

*Edit*: also ""democratic punishment"" sounds a *lot* like mob justice. Look at what reddit did when they tried finding the Boston Marathon bomber. There needs to be someone/some people who are somewhat impartial or otherwise people will be found guilty before there's even a fair justice proceeding to establish who did it and why they did it. (I don't think that our current pay-per-justice system is the right approach to this, but I still believe that in many ways it's better than mob justice). P. S. Hello, comrade!","We already do exile people for certain offenses, namely sex offenses. That's the entire point of the sex offender registry. It ensures any individual on it will never own a home, live in a town of any significant population, or work a job ever again. It's publicly available and there are no shortage of websites dedicated to listing people on it.

Of course, being an ex-con in general exiles you from society to varying degrees. Many jobs become permanently off-limits to you, as does housing and education opportunities.

As for public shaming, we do that already too. Read your local newspaper. There's almost certainly a column dedicated to showing the pictures and details of everyone arrested that week. Courts are usually open to the public as well.

Shunning is inherent with all of these actions. Most people don't want to associate with a felon.

So since we already do these alternatives, we already know the results, and they're pretty bad. As it turns out, cutting people off from opportunities only makes them *more* likely to offend. After all, if you went to prison for dealing drugs, met a bunch of other drug dealers and suppliers there, then get out to find most jobs and learning institutions won't even look at you anymore, do you settle for a months long search to find a crappy minimum wage job, or do you use your prison connections to forge an even more lucrative drug dealing career than what you had before?

As for exile, like in the case of sex offenders, it's really bad. By giving these people nothing left to live for, you've removed all incentive to act on good behavior. There is going back to prison, but if you're homeless and off the grid how are they going to find you? With that ankle monitor you took off?

As for shaming, it can be psychologically traumatic (which will do anything but make a person less likely to offend). The founding fathers were expressly against it as a form of justice as they considered it cruel.

But what about deterrence? Studies have shown that the severity of punishments has rapidly diminishing returns on deterrence factor. In other words, you do need to make sure that the punishments aren't so trivial that people consider them nothing to be worried about, but beyond that it doesn't matter. Why? Criminals don't really consider the potential punishments when committing crime. Either because it's something down impulsively without much thought, or because they think they won't get caught so why worry about the punishments?

Finally, many of inmates in the US corrections system have severe psychiatric illnesses. These people aren't served by being in prison, and they wouldn't be served by other forms of punishment either. What they need is psychiatric treatment, or possibly long-term institutional care (ie living in an asylum).",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides a detailed explanation of the potential pitfalls and negative consequences of the proposed alternatives to incarceration, such as public shaming and exile. The user in Reply A also addresses the lack of rehabilitative goals in these alternatives, the importance of restorative justice, and the potential for certain individuals to be unrepentant and dangerous to society. Additionally, Reply A brings up the concept of democratic punishment potentially leading to mob justice, highlighting the importance of impartiality in the justice system. Overall, Reply A offers a more thorough and well-reasoned argument against the original poster's proposed alternatives."
predict-explain,"This stemmed from a discussion I had on another sub about the Greek economic crisis, and what people are saying should have been done in terms of policy by the EU and the Greek government, which dovetails with what I heard should have been done by the US government in 2008-2010 in the worst part of the Great Recession.

My understanding of Keynesian theory as applied to this kind of economic situation is that it prescribes the government to spend money by using public debt, getting that money to the worker and the spending class. This money, once spent, will require producers to produce more, meaning they need to hire more people, which will give those people more money to spend, creating a virtuous circle of economic growth.

Once recession is over and growth is good, the theory then says that the government should raise revenue out of the booming economy by taxing the producers, the saving class, and the wealthy so as to pay down the debt that it acquired in the previous step.

From that, I conclude that Keynesianism is always either for the working class, the spending class, and the generally poor; and/or against the capitalist, the saving class, and the generally rich. The activities of the former group are economically good and should be encouraged; the activities of the latter group are economically bad (albeit necessary) and should be discouraged, minimized to only what’s absolutely needed to support the activities of the former group.

At this point, I see five possibilities:

1.	Keynesian economics is pure class warfare. Keynes and his followers believe that the working class deserves more and the capitalist class deserves less, and developed a theory to fit that opinion. 
2.	Keynesian economics is *co-opted* by people with an agenda of pure class warfare. It’s perfectly valid under the theory to create the virtuous circle through government spending on Rolls-Royces and summer homes for the rich, and perfectly possible to pay down government debt by heavy taxes on working-class activities like buying groceries and holding personal debt. *How* we spend and tax isn’t the issue, just that we do.
3.	I have an incomplete understanding of Keynesian theory. There can arise economic situations where alternative actions are recommended. For instance, once the economy is growing and the debt is paid, does Keynesianism say to reduce both taxes and spending so as to “shake up the system” and achieve new growth? Or any other situation where good economic policy is to increase inequality and use the natural human jealousy, envy, and fear to spur people to produce more?
4.	I have an inaccurate understanding of Keynesian theory in general. 
5. My understanding is accurate, but my logic is faulty.

Right now my view is hovering between One and Two, but I’d really like to understand this theory better.

Most leftists have a tendency to view Keynesian economics as a left-centrist economic policy aimed toward distracting/appeasing the working class on behalf of the capitalist class.

By advocating for the state to spend money toward the working class as a means for resolving a recession, Keynesian economic shifts the focus of the debate away from critically examining the cycle of capitalism toward issues of taxation, public spending, and the national debt. At it's best, the redistributionary policies of Keynesian economic simply prolong or lessen the magnitudes of these recessionary periods.

To clarify, I am no expert on economics, and I don't feel qualified to debate the utility or success of Keynesian economics. However, ""class warfare"" is a powerful term used to describe the inherent conflict between the capitalist class and the proletariat, and while Keynesian economic may attempt to relatively improve the conditions of the working class, it does not seek to end the capitalist-worker relationship or the private ownership of the means of production.","&gt; From that, I conclude that Keynesianism is always either for the working class, the spending class, and the generally poor; and/or against the capitalist, the saving class, and the generally rich.

It's a little more complicated than that. You are partly-correct, but missing some key information. Keynesian economics is highly focused on unemployment, and during a recession unemployment does hit the working class very severely. Due to job loss, demand for goods and services declines and the profits of the ""capitalist"" manufacturers decline as well. Fiscal policy treats both as *vital* - it really isn't the case that one is more important than the other. Those who say so are talking politics. In economics, both supply and demand are essential. And Keynesian economics addresses this very directly.

I should add that every sensible economist would recommend a mix of Keynesian and monetarist policies. The battle b/w them is politics. I suppose I'm talking of points 2. and 4.",B,A,"I would say that reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more nuanced explanation of Keynesian economics, highlighting the importance of addressing both unemployment and declining demand during a recession. It also emphasizes the need for a mix of Keynesian and monetarist policies, showing that there are different approaches that can be taken. This response provides a more balanced and comprehensive view of Keynesian economics, which may help the original poster see the theory in a different light. 

Reply A, on the other hand, focuses more on the potential shortcomings of Keynesian economics and its relationship with the capitalist class. While it raises valid points, it may come across as more critical and less likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"This is a view I've read about from various pop psychology sources, and it has become conventional wisdom. I believe it contains some truth. Can you convince me it merely reflects the fact that every person has pretty much every trait in them in some form, so if someone says ""I hate X"" they're bound to have some of X in their personality.

An important distinction: I'm talking about ""hate"" that people regularly bring up, like a person who's known for having a hate or dislike of something in particular (something non-trivial, not broccoli or crap movies): **Things that people hate which they think about regularly.**

When people say they hate homosexuals, odds are pretty high they have closeted homosexual desires. This has become a running joke among gay acceptance (i.e. decent) people.

When people say they hate intolerance, you'll often find they're very intolerant of views that strike them as incorrect or un-PC.

Now, take something horrendously evil like pederasty/paedophilia. One of the most heinous, evil, horrible acts possible. Most people I know, however, when asked what they hate in people, don't really mention acts like that. They mention less horrifically evil things: I hate bullies, I hate hypocrisy, I hate rudeness. 

We may want to kill a convicted paedophile with our bare hands, but during our day to day lives we don't think about them often or say we ""hate"" them--we save our long-term hatreds for less evil things. (This may simply be because (say) pedos are so rare and don't show up in our lives very often, or, because people don't hate that which isn't in their own psychological repertoire, or a mixture of both.)

When I say ""I hate religious extremists"", I don't have to be religious to say it, but the underlying trait I hate may be closed-mindedness, which I may hate in myself and which I am afraid of exhibiting. I am 100% convinced I do not have a closed mind, but I cannot easily prove it. Do diehard atheists disprove the idea that what we hate most we hate in ourselves? I also hate animal cruelty, and I've never hurt an animal (knowingly) in my life and have absolutely zero secret or repressed desire to do so. But then again I don't really think about animal cruelty very often, but I do think about other things I hate: petty-mindedness, mean-spiritedness, etc.

Is it all just pop psych bs? I would like a good argument against the idea that our common/over-time objects of hate--particularly a character trait in other people--does not necessarily reflect a hatred of those traits in yourself and a fear that you will express them.

People don't talk about how much they hate paedophilia because it rarely comes up in day-to-day life, and because pretty much everyone hates it. If someone asks you what the worst qualities in a potential date are, you're not gonna say ""paedophilia"" because that kind of goes without saying. There's no reason to mention it. When someone complains about that arsehole Mike scratching their car, it's because they work with Mike every day and he consistently annoys them, not because they are a secret car-scratcher. 

It's true for certain things like homosexuality. I'm not a psychologist, but at a guess I'd say that's because homosexuality doesn't really affect you unless you're gay or someone you know is, so there's little reason to get angry about it otherwise. Again, that's just a guess.

A couple of examples do not prove a rule. You'd probably hate paedophiles a lot more if someone molested your kid. This does not mean you are also a paedophile.","You're already doing a lot of projecting. You're almost cold reading yourself.

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on questioning the original poster's assumptions and the connections they are making between different traits. While it raises valid points about the potential for projection and assumptions, it does not provide a strong counterargument to the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"If you genuinely have an interest in an European country or language, then that beats any reason to learn an East Asian one. However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is more valuable than learning any European language.


-Travel

It's easier for Europeans to learn English and harder for East Asians to learn English.
Most Europeans at the very least speak basic English, and most East Asians only know English words.
You can travel across Europe only knowing English, but in East Asia it helps more to know the language.
I don’t consider places like South America and China to be developed enough to travel through, other than tourist spots catering to English speakers.


-Media

When it comes to media, East Asian countries have their own isolated worlds. Going through their music, films, television and books can almost feel like visiting an alien world since so little reaches the west. 
Specifically Japan and South Korea are economic powerhouses and understand the importance of [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power), and as a means produce a lot more films, music, games, comics, literature and TV than any European or South American country.


-Availability

European languages have more speakers than East Asian languages, but most Europeans already speak English.

For an American there may be a lot Latin American immigrants, but there are Asian immigrants everywhere in the world.

East Asian languages might not be as widely available, but their populations are educated, travel a lot, and have [more native speakers than other European languages.](http://i.imgur.com/SDrGTr8.jpg)


-Difficulty

East Asian languages are said to be notoriously hard by Europeans, but with technology in just the recent years it has become a lot easier. Chinese characters, hangul and Japanese writing systems can now be learned on your smartphone by playing games with apps like memrise or anki.

A lot of European-language speakers complain about how complex European grammar tends to be, whereas East Asian grammar often is “logical” and straight to the point (with exceptions, as any language). 
If you disclude writing systems, East Asian languages would be easier to learn as a spoken language than European ones for someone who has experience with neither.


-Cultural benefits

It’s almost as if their worlds are isolated from ours.
Learning a widely different language helps us understand the structures of our own languages. Learning about a completely different culture helps us understand the uniqueness of our own culture. 

European cultures are often so similar that we only tend to think of simple things as being differentiating between countries, but what makes us unique as westerners becomes much more apparent when compared to a country at the other side of the world.

But I think you miss something very simple. There is value in learning a language that you can use, there is less value in learning a language that you won't use. 

In the case of an European, (I'm taking the Dutch as an example) 
Germany is our biggest trading partner, there is value in learning German for economic reasons. Germany is bordering to us, increasing the amount of times we meet, there is value in learning German for social reasons, like vacations or friendships. which isn't there for Asian languages, because the people aren't vacationing that often in Asian countries as they do in our neighbouring countries. People that we meet in Europe often can speak an european language, even the ones that have origins in Asia, so it is easier to just keep to learning European languages if you are planning to stay inside of Europe. 

One of the best ways to learn a new language is immersion. It is easier to do so in Europe as an European. We have English, French and German as language options on TV for example. And if TV isn't enough we can just travel a few hours and go to a country where the language is spoken. While there is barely any chance to immerse yourself in Asian languages the same way.","Here is the small problem. it is far easier for a Chinese person to learn fluent English than a western to learn any level of fluent Chinese. 

When those two meet, guess what the language will be?

English.

Reply A provides practical reasons for why learning European languages may be more valuable for Europeans, such as economic and social reasons. It also highlights the ease of immersion in European languages due to proximity and availability of resources. These points address the original poster's arguments about the value of learning East Asian languages and provide a different perspective that may make them reconsider their stance.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses on the prevalence of English as a global language and the potential disadvantage of Westerners trying to learn fluent Chinese compared to Chinese people learning fluent English.

Therefore, Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"When Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Tatooine, they encounter Watto, a junk dealer who owns two slaves, Anakin Skywalker and his mother Shmi. When Qui-Gon learns he cannot buy them from Watto, he gambles for Anakin's freedom. 

I believe that Qui-Gon should have removed both Anakin and Shmi from Watto's control, using force (or the Force^haha ) if necessary. 

Since the Jedi are ""guardians of peace and justice"", they are presumably called to right moral wrongs. While slavery is apparently not illegal on Tatooine, it is nevertheless immoral, and Qui-Gon seems to recognize this. 

I realize that gambling on the podrace was necessary, since it would be wrong to take Watto's (non-living) property by force, even if he was dead. But I believe that once the race was over, and Qui-Gon had obtained the parts for the ship under the arrangement he and Watto made, Qui-Gon should have freed Shmi Skywalker using any means necessary. 

Change my view.

EDIT: You guys are sending in some great responses, I'll try to get them all after I get to work. There's a couple that keep coming up that I have issue with, though. 

Watto was a good master - Yes, but she's still a slave. Being a slave sucks bantha balls. 

Anakin was the only one who needed to be freed - Yes, but Shmi shouldn't have to be a slave forever because she's not important enough to the story. 

Qui-Gon couldn't free all the slaves - Yes, but that doesn't mean he shouldn't free the ones he can. 

Anakin needed to sever his emotional connections - Yes, but it seems like he would be more attached to his mother if she was still a slave billions of miles away than if she was living somewhere safe and comfortable. 

The Force wouldn't work on Watto - Toydarians are immune to mind tricks, not being hurled around the room with the Force like a ragdoll. 

EDIT: /u/Makes_Poor_Decisions changed my mind. Anakin would most likely not have become a Jedi if he could have lived with his mother and been free. While it still blows for Shmi, I can see the necessity of her being a slave for Anakin to be willing to leave her behind and become a Jedi.

Part of the reason that the Jedi Council is wary of Anakin is the fact that he is as old as he is, and has such a familial attachment. Jedi are specifically not supposed to have families, to avoid clouding their judgement (Read: making them hard to indoctrinate). Qui-Gon is ultimately trying to make the Jedi order accept Anakin. Taking his mother with them would work against that goal, furthering Anakin's familial attachments. He tries, and ultimately fails, (though how much of that failure is his, and how much is Obi-Wan's, is up for debate) to separate him from his mother to make him a better Jedi by removing as much of his emotional attachments in order to make him into a more acceptable, emotionally neutral Jedi. Obviously, this ended up failing horrifically, but Qui-Gon had no way of knowing at the time. And admittedly, remember that it ends up being Obi-Wan, not Qui-Gon, that trains Anakin. We have know way of knowing how Qui-Gon had planned on training Anakin to remove his emotional attachments, because he dies and Obi-Wan has to take over to the best of his ability.

Removing Anakin from his mother is more closely in tune with his overall motives. If had rescued the mother, it almost certainly would have made it impossible for him to be a Jedi.","From a moral/practical standpoint, of course Qui-Gon should have freed both Anakin and Schmi - but you have to remember that the world that Qui-Gon lives in is not a practical world. Everyone he meets has a fate and a purpose in the eyes of this weird puppet-master called ""The Force"".

In Schmi's case she was a test for Anakin. Anakin is always overly attached to Schmi (and all the motherly figures in his life, like Padme). Eventually Schmi's death starts his real descent into the dark side. Qui-Gon didn't know this specifically, but his prophetic powers probably gave him enough information to know that Anakin's ability to overcome his attachment to his mother was vital and figured that sooner was better than later. Remember, Qui-Gon always knew the prophecy about Anakin and probably came to Tatooine under some kind of instruction from the force. Even if Qui-Gon had known that Schmi's death would have made Anakin go apeshit he probably would not have wanted to bring her along anyway. We see Anakin's obsessive need to control the lives of those around him based on his actions surrounding his visions of Padme's death. If Schmi had been around, in Qui-Gon's eyes at least, she would be another distraction. In fact she would have been on Coruscant during both the Battle of Coruscant when thousands of burning capital ships rained down on the planet and during the execution of order 66. If she wasn't dead by that point, Palpatine would have made sure some accident happened given his designs on Anakin.

So, to summarize - from a simple moral standpoint of jedi good, slavery bad - sure, Qui-Gon might have felt compelled to go vigilante on Watto - it certainly would not have been out of character. However, Qui-Gon was much more concerned with saving the force itself through the vessel of Anakin, so he decided that out of the way on Tatooine would be the best place for Schmi. Bringing her to Coruscant would probably not have saved her life or Anakin's soul.",A,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a deeper analysis of Qui-Gon's actions and motivations, taking into account the larger context of the Star Wars universe and the role of the Force. It explains how Qui-Gon's decision to leave Shmi behind was not just a moral choice, but also a strategic one in terms of Anakin's destiny and the prophecy surrounding him. The response also touches on the potential dangers Shmi would have faced if she had been taken off Tatooine, adding a practical element to the discussion.

In contrast, reply A focuses more on the Jedi philosophy and the detachment required of Jedi, which is a valid point but may not fully address the complex factors at play in Qui-Gon's decision-making process. Reply B provides a more comprehensive argument that takes into account the broader implications of freeing Shmi and the impact it would have had on Anakin's journey."
predict-explain,"I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately.  I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural.  If after death we experience what we experienced before birth which is nothingness, then isnt life meaningless?  Why should we continue to suffer when life is literally a constant suffering?  I personally believe life is meaningless.  When you are under the assumption that you experience nothingness when you are dead, what is the point of living?  
The only reason I can personally see for living is to not inflict additional emotional suffering on those that you know and care about you.  But if you do experience nothingness after life then why should it matter when you wont be able to conceive of this suffering.
Its been something I've been thinking a lot about lately... Change my view, please.
Also, this is not a cry for help and I will not be jumping off the golden gate bridge any time soon.","Life is meaningless. Yup, I agree, and everyone else should too - at least insofar that they can't prove that any meaning exists.

However, to start with let's just leave it at ""we should all commit suicide"" absolutely does not follow from ""life is meaningless"".","Why does anyone go to the park if they know they're going to have to leave soon? Why does anyone watch a movie if they know it's going to end? The meaning of life is to give life a meaning. No matter how shitty. We shouldn't commit suicide because there's too much instant gratification in this world to pass up. Music. Art. Film. Sex. Drugs. Human interaction. These are all things to make you feel alive and to indulge in. Like you said- if we expect nothingness after we die, then why give up the somethingness that you already have right now?

predict-explain,"Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of being in the main stream, I'm still not convinced that vaccines are all they are cracked up to be. 

Between whistle blowers (William Thomson, Scott Cooper, Andrew Wakefield etc) and corruption within the vaccine industry, it seems like something sinister is afoot. There are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest.

Now I'm not antivaccine (although I haven't been immunized yet) I'm just not pro vaccine. I haven't seen enough to discredit this dark side of things and show undoubtedly that vaccinations are the way to go.

Please change my view.","What are the main heath concerns that you have with vaccines? Are they worse than the potential medical issues that could arise from people not being vaccinated?

Aside from that, there are some people who can't get vaccinated because of certain medical issues. These people rely on heard immunity to protect themselves from the diseases that vaccinations are supposed to prevent. If more people who can get vaccinated don't, it puts those who can't get vaccinated at a greater risk to develop some of the issues that vaccines can prevent. If everyone who can get vaccinated does, it makes it much less likely that these medical issues develop on a large scale.","&gt; I haven't seen enough to discredit this dark side of things and show undoubtedly that vaccinations are the way to go.

Vaccines are one of the single greatest medical interventions that human beings have ever developed. I guess you know where I stand. This anti-vax hullabaloo is a bunch of nonsense, and is only present in developed countries. Parents have forgotten what Polio and Rubella do to children, or they wouldn't be so cocksure when denying their children vaccinations. I really don't care how someone raises their child (religion, homeschooling, etc.) but not vaccinating them is plain stupidity. Not malice, just ignorance.

If you want, I can debunk just about any conspiracy theory you could bring up regarding vaccines, but I don't think it'll be necessary. I'll just deal with the most pernicious point first, ask me for more if you need to. 

One of the biggest reasons for this panic is because people think that vaccines cause autism. They don't. The Lancet paper that started that has been thoroughly debunked. In the meantime, there have been multiple controlled studies that have demonstrated that there is no link b/w vaccines and autism: [Study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003140) and [an overview with even more available studies](http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4026.pdf)",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"Yesterday, there was this post in /r/futurology titled **[Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/17/technology-created-more-jobs-than-destroyed-140-years-data-census)**. In the comments, a lot of people concluded that this means that in the future, technology will keep creating more jobs than it destroys. **I disagree**. 

At the moment, a five year old kid can beat a computer in a lot of things. For example, having a conversation is very hard for AI. So there are still lots of simple jobs that cannot be done by technology. 

As long as our civilization does not collapse, technology and AI will keep getting better. In the near future, self-driving cars will replace a lot of jobs. This kind of stuff will keep happening until mechanical brains outperform human brains, at a similar or lower cost. When that happens, human labor will become as redundant as horse labor. **Change my view!**

**[Obligatory ""Humans Need Not Apply link""](https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU?t=3m31s)**","I agree that most unskilled labor jobs will be made redundant. But it won't be as bad as most people think, here's why:

Almost everyone forgets about competition. There will be multiple companies in the future automating food production / delivery / sales. These companies will compete on price. As they both save costs by automating they will lower their prices (if you don't lower your prices no one will shop with you and you'll go out of business). Eventually this will drive the cost of food to almost zero. 

Similar events will unfold in housing, clothing and other markets. 

Once this happens it will be fairly easy for people to have their basic needs met at almost zero cost and the government will provide this for them (else they'll be riots, that's what happens when people get hungry). 

Now skilled labor in research and technology won't go away for a long, long time (at least until they invent real AI). There is literally infinite technology we can invent and create and almost infinite medical problems to solve. We could have all 7 billion people in the world working in technology and medicine and we still wouldn't have anywhere near enough. For anyone that wants to work and puts in the effort to get into these fields there will be an endless supply of things to do.","I actually agree with you, but there's a couple of things that I think might be able to prevent this for occurring.

Nanobot implants inserted into the brain could help cure degenerative diseases in the future. Beyond that, they could go on to boost human capabilities to machine like levels.

It's possible that humans may be able to compete with machines for jobs in the future because of this. It wouldn't be an ideal scenario, but it would maintain the status quo. That could be a dangerously powerful effect. A structure that forces people into strengthening that structure could persist long after it has become redundant. 


The other thing is a bit simpler. The dream is that machines do all the work while humans live a life of leisure, right? But, maybe a life of leisure wouldn't be all that enjoyable. Human desire to build something for themselves or be remembered could keep people working. Maybe not in a way that you'd call ""labour"" but on personal and collaborative projects or works that they share with others.",B,A,"I would say Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a practical and optimistic outlook on the future, highlighting the potential for automation to drive down costs and make basic needs more accessible to everyone. The idea of an endless supply of opportunities in research and technology also presents a positive perspective on the potential impact of automation on the job market.

On the other hand, Reply B introduces interesting concepts like nanobot implants and the potential for humans to compete with machines in the future. While these ideas are intriguing, they may not be as immediately convincing or applicable to the current discussion about the impact of technology on job creation and destruction.

Overall, Reply A presents a more grounded and compelling argument that addresses the original poster's concerns about the future of work in the face of advancing technology."
predict-explain,"Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible.  There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as the worst pizza you can find in a restaurant.

I have searched for years trying to find frozen pizza that's half as good as even Little Caesar's, but to no avail.  I've come to terms with the fact that every variety has low-quality sauce and not enough cheese.  What I can't stand, however, and definitely the most common flaw, is the terrible, *terrible* crust, which ends up either undercooked or bone dry, without fail.

I understand that pizza can only be properly cooked using a pizza stone, but it completely baffles me that this is the best we can do without one in 2015.","I will agree that frozen pizza can never compare to fresh pizza, but such is the case with any food.

I happen to like red Barron frozen pizza. In order to bring out its full potential you have to add to the pizza, if you do not add to you will not get a good result. I will add fresh onions, peppers, and some kind of meat(ham, sausage, pepperoni, etc.) I will also add sirachi applied in a circle over the pizza. I will also keep garlic sauce in the fridge, from a pizza place, if I have any I will put a little of this on the top. I also add a light layer of cheese, whatever's in the fridge, then bake.

I would say that the delissio rising crust when cooked properly and fresh out of the oven is superior to the lower tier of little ceasers hot and ready pizzas. Mainly because of the immediacy you can eat the pizza from the oven.

predict-explain,"I realise that this is a meme one itself nowadays, but as a black man I have absolutely no sympathy for any redditor who was on coontown. These people hate me, and I hate them, plain and simple, and I am happy it made their lives even slightly worse.

People have said that it is the issue of how to define what a hate subreddit is, but I just think that this is a diversionary argument of semantics. The difference between, say Coontown, and Shitredditsays is light and day, and anyone who says different needs to walk a mile in other peoples shoes. 

The final argument against seems to be that the banning of coontown was for reasons of brigading, and that this was wrong. If this is the case, then Shitredditsays should be banned too, and I certainly wouldn't miss it, but I really wouldn't argue that Coontown should be brought back.

Ultimately, they were banned for their content, and that makes quite a few people uncomfortable. In effect, no one knows what the rules concerning acceptable content are anymore. More troublingly, it marks an immense change in reddit's policy; just a few years ago, during spez's last time in charge, he unequivocally stated that content would never be banned. Now? That's quite obviously changed.

I'm really struggling with this one, CMV. This is my first post here. Reading through threads concerning this issue here on Reddit has made me wonder if I'm just a heartless jackass or not since it appears most of Reddit goes against the grain with me on this issue here. 

I don't feel like it's wrong to drug test welfare recipients. I agree somewhat with the view that if I am required to pass a drug test to even have a shot at a job, a welfare recipient should have to do the same to receive assistance which they're not required to work for. I've heard that a 30 day rehabilitation option is offered in some states for people who test positive, and benefits are cut off for those who refuse that option. I don't agree with punishing someone for addiction and not offering help, but if the drug testing states implemented this policy, I don't think I'd see any problems with it at all. 

I feel this way because I've been in a lot of situations where this has been a relevant issue. Cashiering for a small town grocery store growing up, knowing the people using food stamps at the counter, and also knowing that the majority if them are using drugs (small town) helped me form an opinion early on. I didn't think it was fair that at 16, my tax money was being used to help someone pay for food when they spent their money on drugs. If they wanted food, why not by it instead of drugs? Of course, now that I'm older I realize that not everything is so black and white, and that this goes deeper than my 16 year old opinion. 

I'm a home health nurse that works with pediatric patients in their homes. My patients are almost always in very poor, run down neighborhoods. All of these families are on food stamps and government assistance (my nursing contract is paid through their Medicaid) and literally, out of the last 10 families I've worked with, 4 of the parents used some kind of drug in front of me, and at least 3 more parents were very obviously using drugs. I'm not counting alcohol or tobacco use either, just what's actually being tested for. 

I have compassion and empathy for people, and I'm very left-leaning on most issues. I'm 100% for human rights, and I try to imagine myself in other's shoes before forming an opinion, but this is something that I just don't see a problem with, especially if rehabilitation is an offered option. I've also struggled with my own habits and addictions to alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana. I realize not all people are the same, but any time I've needed a job badly enough, I've been able to kick the weed and nicotine long enough to pass a pre employment screening. I feel like that's my responsibility, and that plays into why I've formed the opinion that I have.

So help me out, CMV. Change my view.

Edit: I should also probably note that I understand the low statistics on how many people actually do end up popping positive in these tests, and I realize that it's costing a lot of tax money to do so. I don't think it's a waste of tax payer money if these people are being offered an option to be rehabilitated.",The main reason I am against drug testing welfare recipients is because to me it violates the 4th ammendment which protects people from unreasonable search and seizure. I fall on the side that because you need welfare is not a good enough reason to be subject to a search of drug use through a drug test. It is a tough moral issue either way though. You also need to remember that it isn't difficult to cheat on a drug test and that many of these people aren't actually using drugs. There will always be a percentage that takes advantage of welfare but it is usually small. By drug testing it does end up costing the taxpayer more and doesn't really resolve the issue of getting these people off drugs and into a lifestyle they can be successful in. All it really seems to do is make it harder to pull themselves back up.,"Most drug users aren't addicts.  Most addicts are still good parents.

There is a pretty big intersection in the ""bad-parent/drug-addict"" venn diagram, but one still doesn't imply the other.

It sounds like you're more upset that these people are wasting taxpayer money.

What, really, is the difference?",B,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A focuses on the constitutional issue of violating the 4th amendment rights of welfare recipients through drug testing.

By highlighting these concerns, Reply A presents a more comprehensive argument against drug testing welfare recipients, which may prompt the original poster to reconsider their stance."
predict-explain,"It is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. We already have it! It’s the trains! If public transport such as railways are expanded and given priority over road vehicles in infrastructure, then we can achieve the goals that the automotive industry is trying to achieve very quickly.

We should divert the resources that we spend on making smarter cars (finances and human capital) to making smarter, faster, safer, public transport and expand the rail network. If we just expand the rail network then people will automatically shift from driving a car to riding on a train as their preferred choice of daily commute.

Some of the points I have against road transport for individuals.


•	Environmental impact- A vast majority of cars are running on fuels that emit pollutants in the environment.


•	Safety- Road injury was one of the top 10 causes of death in the world. According to WHO, road injury took lives of 1.3 Million people in the last decade.


•	Stress– While driving for enjoyment is really fun on your off days, daily commute hardly is. We are spending a nice chunk of our day that we can spend relaxing, reading or working to complete the last minute project on a rather stressful, and repetitive driving route facing traffic jams and asshole drivers.


•	Energy efficiency – A car owner takes a Ton of metal with him just to get from point A to B. Fuel efficiency of trains is superior to that of cars.


•	Maintenance – a car requires frequent upkeep and maintenance of its parts and components.


•	Economy – Transportation is lot more expensive in cars.
Here are some points that I have for expansion of public transport.


•	Bonus free time – When I’m in a train I can browse my phone, read a news paper work on my presentation without the fear of killing someone. This is something driverless cars are trying to achieve and are still years away from it.


•	Potty Breaks – trains can be modified to have them, cars don’t. I’d have to pause my driving, find a gas station and then resume it again, why do that when you can go on the go.


•	Fuel Efficiency.


•	Noise reduction.


•	Skill Transfer- People who graduate in engineering and were thinking of joining an automotive manufacturer can just as easily join a locomotive manufacturer.


I am not arguing for an absolute ban on using cars, I just think if we focus on public transport more than we would solve a lot of problems that automotive market is trying to eliminate. Problems such as energy efficiency, pollution, and vehicle automation can be achieved with technology that we have **today.**

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","One major point that I think you need to consider is personal preference.  Like it or not, most people prefer the freedom to leave when exactly when they want, directly from their current location, and directly to their destination.  These are things that public transportation requires compromises on, often quite significant compromises in the type of environment that most Americans live in.

With that in mind, even if you were somehow able to fund and construct the *perfect* public transportation system, I don't think you'd get anywhere near 100% adoption by the public.

I live in a fairly public transportation ""friendly"" city, by most standards, and while our system is far from perfect, it is fairly extensive.  I find it personally more pleasant to take the bus when going downtown, rather than dealing with traffic.

By the way, while we have a relatively good public transit system, we have a really poor infrastructure for driving.  Everyone here complains about the traffic, and it's only continuing to get worse.  I only point this out to say that my city is probably close to a best case scenario for giving people incentive to use public transit.

However, most people here don't make that same calculation.  Either the slight time loss waiting for the bus on both legs of a journey, or the time lost stopping to pick up passengers, or the inconvenience of buying tickets, or the loss of freedom, or something else causes most people around here to continue to drive.

If a relatively good public transit system loses out in peoples minds to a relatively poor private vehicle system, then I don't think our time is best spent making a good public transit system marginally better.

There's a parallel argument that might make this point better.  A lot of people choose to drive large trucks or SUVs either because they use the hauling capacity for work or leisure, or honestly, sometimes just because they want to.  Some environmental activists would prefer we oppose trucks at all costs, pushing everyone towards smaller and more efficient vehicles, even hybrids if we can.

The problem with that is that we've had limited success so far.  Trucks are still a hugely disproportionate part of the total auto sales in the US.

With that in mind, is it still worth the effort and trouble to continue to fight against human nature and the incentives that push people into buying trucks, or is it better to limit the impact of the trucks that are going to be sold anyway?

We've finally started to do the latter, with new trucks starting to come out with much more fuel efficient engines, lighter construction, and better aerodynamics.  It's to the point that some full size trucks are talking about getting 30 mpg in the near future, which is better than my small hatchback.

I see your argument as something similar.  In ideal world, no one would buy a truck unless they actually truly *needed* it.  In an ideal world, everyone would take advantage of a perfect public transit system should we provide one.

In the real world, people just want what they want for a variety of complicated reasons.  Ignoring that leads to solutions for ideal world problems which totally fail to do anything for real world problems.","I will be addressing this situation in the US, where public transit is generally not highly regarded and there is vast infrastructure for personal vehicles. I will also try to avoid cultural biases.
I agree with your sentiment, However I don't view the two as alternatives to one another, nor is either one a complete solution to all transportation problems.
most major US cities would benefit from better and cleaner public transportation. This is held back in large part by the fact that the US is heavily invested in the massive personal transport infrastructure it already has, and attempts to reform the entire system could be very disruptive to public life.
There are also inherent limitations to public transportation. Traditional mass transit is not a good model for the widely-spaced, diffuse populations in a lot of the middle of the country. It is also an imperfect solution for people with disabilities: a member of my family is unable to drive due to visual impairment, and cannot walk very well due to partial paralysis in the leg. Even if suburban public transit provided a direct route from our town to where she works, it would be very difficult for her to make It to and from the station. A self driving vehicle could allow for a greater degree of mobility and autonomy for handicapped people.",B,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A brings up the important point of personal preference and the freedom that individuals value when it comes to transportation. It acknowledges that even with a perfect public transportation system, not everyone would choose to use it due to various reasons such as time constraints, convenience, and personal preferences. By highlighting the challenges and limitations of public transportation, Reply A effectively argues that focusing solely on public transport may not be the most practical or feasible solution in the real world.

On the other hand, while Reply B also brings up valid points about the limitations of public transportation in the US and the need for a balance between public transport and personal vehicles, it does not directly address the original poster's arguments and does not provide as strong of a counter-argument as Reply A. Reply A effectively challenges the original poster's view by emphasizing the importance of considering individual preferences and the complexities of human behavior when it comes to transportation choices."
predict-explain,"A few points clarifying my view:

* By primary language, I mean either *official* language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that country (i.e. English in America)

* I don't expect fluency. My mother has lived in Canada for almost twenty years now and she still has trouble sometimes. My view is that all immigrants should strive for at the very least an [intermediate](http://www.londonschool.com/level-scale/) mastery. 

* My one exception would be if an immigrant does not have the financial capability to pay for lessons in the language of the country they've moved to. However, in Canada at least, free English lessons are offered to new immigrants, so I wouldn't see any reason to not learn the language here. 

Not learning the primary language of the country they've moved to encourages segregation and often leads to racial or cultural tension. By refusing to learn the primary language to an acceptable extent, they're showing a blatant refusal to adapt even a little to their new country's culture. Even if you're living in an area where you could live your entire life speaking your mother tongue, it doesn't make sense to not at least do the bare minimum to adapt. What's the point of coming all the way to another country if you're not going to respect it? Multiculturalism is wonderful and should be valued, but refusing to learn the country's language and creating enclaves is *preventing* multiculturalism.

First of all,  for the past 200 years, older people immigrating have very often kept their original language.

Now, virtually all of their children became fluent English speakers.  And many of these are the most ""patriotic"" (whatever that means) people, who no doubt respect their country.

But their parents formed enclaves - Little Italy, Chinatown, the Lower East Side, and on and on.  Today, in Minnesota, we have groups of Somali and Hmong where all of the kids (at least those who have been here a while) are fluent in English, but the older community members still speak their native language.

They learn about the country, pay taxes, are thankful to be here.  But it's damned hard to up and move to a new place.  The food, customs, living spaces, jobs- all different.  Now, of course the first ones to come need to learn the language, because they don't yet have a community.  But the rest tend to go where there are others already like them.

Why add the burden of learning a new language (which is difficult at an older age)?  Their kids will know it, and can help them when translations are needed.

Considering that this was the case for centuries, are you really arguing that Italians, Jews, Germans, Chinese, Japanese, Russians, etc,etc never became part of the culture?  That we haven't swirled their customs into the melting pot?","I can understand how it appears this way, but I think you are misunderstanding people's intentions and realities. I grew up among immigrant communities in Queens, NYC and worked a decent amount providing social services to immigrants.

The immigrants that you're talking about, that don't learn English, generally don't move to America because they love American culture and want multiculturalism. They do it for practical and survival-oriented reasons. They keep their heads down and work hard and try to make money so that they can help their children have a less crappy life, or so that they can send money to their impoverished families. Or, they flee here because shit is godawful in their home country and they just want to mind their own business and live with a modicum of stability and do better.

A lot of these people are really poor. Sometimes, they have degrees from their home countries that don't count for anything in America. So they work long hours 6 days a week in entry-level shitty paying jobs in restaurants or nail salons or driving cabs. They are often financially exploited. After all that work, they just get by paying expensive rent and try to save enough to send money to their families. Some community-based organizations and libraries do offer English language classes. But when would they squeeze that in? They are busy working and scraping by - they often don't have the time or the energy to take classes. If you ask if they want to learn English, many of them will say yes. They may insist that their children learn English and worry that their kids won't speak perfect English. But I think Maslow's hierarchy of needs applies here. If they are living in an enclave where English isn't part of the essential skills necessary for success, and they are working hard to keep afloat, English is going to drop by the wayside. It's not about respect; it's about survival.",A,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B provides a more empathetic and nuanced perspective on why some immigrants may not prioritize learning the primary language of their new country. It highlights the practical and survival-oriented reasons why some immigrants may struggle to learn a new language, such as financial constraints, long work hours, and the need to support their families. This reply also emphasizes the challenges and hardships that many immigrants face, which may not always align with the original poster's assumptions about immigrants refusing to adapt or respect their new country. Overall, Reply B offers a more comprehensive and compassionate view that could potentially lead the original poster to reconsider their stance on this issue."
predict-explain,"Today marks the 10th anniversary of the 7/7 bombings in London. To commemorate this there has been a supposedly nation wide minute silence. While I wouldn't interrupt a minute silence I do think that they are arbitrary and not a good way of ""showing respect"".

Usually they are touted as a way of remembering victims of tragedies, however as someone who lives across the country, I do not know the victims or any of their family and as a result other than the circumstances in which it happened, their deaths have little to no effect on my life. Because of this, I think it is disingenuous and borderline offensive to those close to the victims for me to pretend that I am actively upset by their deaths.

In addition to this I said that minute silences are arbitrary; millions of people have died in  the ten years since, some of them in similar circumstances even yet 99.9% of those will go "" unremembered "". Surely by not holding a minute silence for at least the people who died in terror attacks we are tacitly implying disrespect? One could argue that it should be something carried out only in the home country of the victims which would not explain why the whole world continues to hold minute silences to commemorate 9/11.

I am not saying that there should be a blanket ban on minute silences however. For example it recently made the news that there was a minute silence in the stadium before a football game to acknowledge the death of a fan. I wholeheartedly support that as it shows a community (either his literal, local community or the community of football fans) coming together to show solidarity for someone who's death may well have personally affected many of them. 

I apologise for the wall of text and any spelling mistakes due to mobile typing. Please change my view as it makes me feel like a cold and disrespectful person.

In this case, much like the 7/7 bombings as well as the 9/11 attacks, it is a tragedy that informs the cultural identity of an entire nation. I think it is more about showing solidarity with a collective rather than for the comfort of those directly affected, and I think that can be quite beautiful.

That said, there's an unfortunate political opportunity in these kind of things. I'm uneasy in moments like these, knowing that this solidarity is often exploited to achieve some unsavory political goals. Politicians in Israel, the UK, and the US are guilty of this. Politicians everywhere are guilty of this.

So yes, while these moments are easily tainted by a select group of people, I believe there's an undeniable beauty to them. I think there's an insincerity to this moment commemorating the holocaust--it's no secret that Israel doesn't have the best track record on human rights and Israel's past has been used to justify those actions--but even if the moment is leveraged for political gain, there's still something hauntingly sacred about it. That might make it worth experiencing.","So you support it to create/reinforce a sense of community, but to an extent, the entire nation (and increasingly the globe) is a coherent community. Droughts and fires in California don't affect those on the east coast, but does keep people aware of the larger situation.

Similarly, the closeness doesn't matter. In your example, almost no one in the stadium knew about the fan or who they were or were going home to a different social environment due to loss. Even worse, those who instigated the moment of silence knew the victim as a *revenue stream* and not much more. They were seeking to reinforce loyalty to their still existing revenue streams.

Meanwhile, I have the same rationale as you to not desire participating in a moment of silence if someone in my own town dies if I don't know them well. ""But I might know those affected!"" Sure, and you might know people dealing with Canadian fires, or those who have relatives that went on an unfortunate vacation and we're attacked by extremists, or people whose family are trying to extend help to their relatives in Greece. Hell, you might even just be a person that wants to plan a vacation. Maybe I won't go to Canada while it's burning. Maybe I want to go somewhere I can lend support (morally, emotionally, or fiscally) while in an foreign state/country.

Is it arbitrary? Yes, but it doesn't matter because (1) I don't think there is an objective way do pay respect; and (2) it doesn't matter what you are doing- what matters is that the event is in your mind. Hell, it doesn't matter if your mind is thinking ""This damn 7/7 shit is bullshit"" because that thought keeps the event in your mind. Maybe you *do* visit London, for whatever reason. If you see more stringent security in action than you might have expected, or a memorial, you won't look like a fool when you act in ignorance of the circumstances behind these things.",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This reply provides a perspective on the importance of moments of silence in showing solidarity with a collective and how it can be seen as a beautiful gesture. The user acknowledges the potential for these moments to be exploited for political gain but still finds value in the sense of unity they can bring. Additionally, the user brings up the example of the Holocaust to illustrate the point that even if these moments are leveraged for political purposes, there is still something sacred about them. This nuanced perspective may help the original poster see the value in participating in moments of silence, even if they do not personally know the victims."
predict-explain,"The general consensus with frame rates greater than 24 or 30 fps in live action work is that it sucks. The illusion of a flickery alternate world breaks down when the motion is as smooth as reality. The viewer more readily perceives actors in makeup on sets. It all just looks... fake. Any film in HFR, either filmed at 48 or interpolated on a TV, looks like a cheap soap opera.

I recently bought a PS4. GTA V looks WORSE than it did on the PS3. The draw distance is better, there are less pop-ins, but the frame rate is too high. Everything looks smooth and fake and video gamey. Flying over the city reminds me of playing N64, because I can't see Los Santos. I just see a bunch of polygons and textures and shaders. Actors in makeup on sets. *EDIT: GTA5 runs at 30fps on PS4. Why does it look worse? Why does it feel more fake? Is the falseness of everything just... clearer?*

I just wish there was a way to limit the frame rate to 24 or 30. It would look fantastic.

But I keep hearing people say they NEED 60fps! I don't know why this is but I have some guesses:

1. Gamers want that hyper reality. Video games and live action film are two completely different mediums, so games are expected to (or at least allowed to) look different. There is something about that false smoothness that is appealing to a gamer. It makes something look ""video gamey"".

2. Is it more of a PC thing? As a way to show off? A high frame rate means the computer is powerful/expensive. It gives the user a feeling that their machine is worth the money? I don't know.

3. It increases gamer performance? Does it have something to do with getting the slightest advantage when playing other people? Do gamers with the highest refresh rates perform better? Does getting the most headshots mean more than enjoying an immersive experience?

I suppose that's the sticking point: immersion. A high frame rate does not immerse me in a video game. It does the opposite.

(NB This is my view of games on a rectangular screen; I've never tried a modern VR like Oculus. HFR is probably critical with that.)","&gt; Does it have something to do with getting the slightest advantage when playing other people? Do gamers with the highest refresh rates perform better? Does getting the most headshots mean more than enjoying an immersive experience?

Short answer: yes. Long answer: not every video game is story-driven. If you're playing multiplayer CoD, LoL, or WoW, you're going to want the high FPS in order to be able to react better. Not everybody wants to be told a story in games (especially not triple-A games - I haven't enjoyed a triple-A story since Portal, which was also only arguably triple-A), and for those people, anything much less than 60 FPS - especially something as low as 25-30 - is very, very bad.

&gt; I just wish there was a way to limit the frame rate to 24 or 30. It would look fantastic.

Many games nowadays (especially PC games) have FPS caps you can adjust. They usually slide all over, from very low to 120 and up. Look into GTA - it's possible there's a mod that would help install it. This is probably the best solution - lower FPS isn't for everyone, but some people - like you - enjoy it and would prefer an easy way to limit it.

&gt; I suppose that's the sticking point: immersion. A high frame rate does not immerse me in a video game. It does the opposite.

I guess this is the crux of the matter: not everyone feels this way. Personally, I see very little difference whether the game is 25 FPS or 60 - if the story is engaging, I'll like the game. Persona 4 Golden is one of my favorite games story-wise, and IIRC it's got an FPS of 60 - that doesn't affect the story IMO. I find it hard to really get immersed in a game unless the writing is good, regardless of graphics (although sometimes graphics will be a turn-off) - even though To The Moon isn't the prettiest pixel art I've seen, I got totally engrossed in it and played it through in one sitting. To me, high frame rate isn't a bad thing - bad storytelling, grammatical errors, and graphical glitches are what will turn me off in terms of immersion.

For you, is 60FPS bad for games' storytelling? Sure, why not. For absolutely everyone else, is this also true? Not in the slightest.","Part of the issues depend on what game you're playing, as well as what you're used to.

For the first: a really twitch-based shooter like Counter-Strike is going to be more dependent on a high frame rate than a turn-based strategy game like Civilization. Generally, the faster paced the game is the more dependent on framerate your experience.

Secondly: I play on PC. I've only ever played on PC. I started looking at games at 60FPS, so that's what I'm used to as a *bare minimum*. I'll turn down settings to keep that frame rate. 30 just looks jerky and bad to me. In much the same way, since it appears that 30 is what you're used to, 60 seems ""off"" or ""wrong""

Yes, it generally is a PC thing but that's because PC is more able to push 60FPS on more games, since usually having things like tesselation and high quality textures at high resolution is a trade-off with frame rate, most consoles elect to go with 30FPS and turn their graphics settings up, rather than turn their graphics settings down and hit 60FPS",A,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news ([x](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/hilary-clinton-the-sight-black-man-hoodie-scary-open-minded-whites/), [x](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/hilary-clinton-the-sight-black-man-hoodie-scary-open-minded-whites/)) after delivering a speech in which she said that ""for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear."" Publications from across the political spectrum tore her a new one for this comment in perceived poor taste. The article from the Federalist was spread on tumblr, and eventually popular user katara [reblogged with the full context](http://hunty.us/post/125041947641/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) of the quote, and people started criticizing the people passing around the articles for taking things out of context / not doing their research.    

(Here's where my opinion comes in.) I think that tumblr's reputation of false alarm and out-of-context sound bites isn't unique to tumblr at all, it's the way popular American media has operated for the last few decades- if not more. [Many](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/09/18/just-the-scandal-of-the-week-or-a-turning-point/the-news-media-and-its-soundbite-culture) [people](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/our-sound-bite-culture-sh_b_93720.html) have discussed the ""sound-bit culture"" that becomes especially popular in presidential election cycles. Given that this is the norm for modern day news, I think politicians have a responsibility to avoid creating problematic soundbites.   

Specifically, I think Clinton doesn't deserve the sympathy she's getting from [people](http://bleecake.tumblr.com/post/125130165347/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) who feel as though the media took her quote out of context. Clinton has been a politician for DECADES, she's got more experience than practically anybody- she's gone through 2 successful presidential election campaign as a candidate's spouse and this is her second presidential campaign as a candidate herself. She's been in more controversy over the years than anybody can keep track of. She's got almost unanimous support from the Democratic party, and lord knows she can afford good speechwriters and campaign managers. So why in the hell would she deliver a speech with the sentiment of basically ""Black people are scary... is what a racist would say. Racism is bad."" Surely, she knows people are only gonna take the first bit of that clip, and they're gonna run with it.    

To me, the fact that this ""quotable"" passed through all the levels of Clinton's campaign team is just an indicator of how little anyone working for Clinton (including herself) really gives a shit. She could wake up tomorrow and say she intends on starting a nuclear war with Iran, and she'd still get the Democratic nomination. Because of that, I think the media has the right (and responsibility) to challenge Clinton. A good candidate is a candidate who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context.    

We (the American people) are not getting the candidate we want or deserve, because we keep tripping over ourselves to help out Clinton.

Any meaningful discourse about real, workable solutions to these complex problems will necessarily need descriptions that defy brief, quotable sound bytes.  You say ""a good candidate is one who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context""-- in other words, you are asking for a candidate whose speeches consist only of empty platitudes, and ignore all issues that are sufficiently complex as to require some ""setup lines"" in order to explain.  


While it is true that the media prefers to focus on out-of-context sound-bytes (because this allows them to engage in low-effort, high-reward ""gaffe journalism""), we the American people should push back on this tendency if we are ever to have any hope of a public discourse that is actually constructive.  You may be so cynical as to believe that no politician will ever be willing to take up these problems meaningfully; nonetheless, that's how our system is designed, and if they don't, no one else can.  Part of our responsibility as citizens is to demand accountability not just from our elected officials, but from the news media who cover them.  The Internet has actually revolutionized fact-checking, and made it very difficult for erroneous or misleading news stories like the one you describe to survive very long before being called out.  This, in my opinion, is a good thing for democracy.


As a final note, I want to make a particular comment on your statement that ""we keep tripping over ourselves to help out Clinton.""  I'm not sure who the ""we"" in this statement is meant to refer to, but the [news media has a famously frosty relationship with the Clintons](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/10/after-two-decades-of-hostility-can-hillary-clinton-change-the-dynamic-between-her-and-the-press/) and certainly is not looking to do Hillary any favors if they can help it.","The ability to never misspeak or have such hollow speeches that nothing can be taken out of context is not a good indicator of someone who will be a good legislator or executive.

Who are the types of people who have no skeletons in their closet (or paid to cover them up) and do research to figure out how people will react to every word you say?

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the practical implications of expecting politicians to always speak perfectly, arguing that this would limit the pool of qualified individuals willing to enter politics.

predict-explain,"I believe that people have a **moral obligation** to donate money they do not need. Full stop.

But the government (specifically that of America) is not in the business of moralizing. The government is established to protect inalienable rights and to allow for fair competition. There are many cases where the government is not doing its job in allowing for fair competition, but I am not speaking about these cases. I'm going to give a few scenarios, and I'd love if someone who disagrees could criticize the conclusions I make.

- There are two pizza delivery companies. One of the company owners, Pablo, spent every night for the past 6 months figuring out how to optimize his business. He found better ways to incubate pizzas, better ways to stack pizzas in his pizza-mobile, and also found better ways to pizza his pizza. Because of this, more people are buying his pizzas. In the next year, Pablo earned three times as much as his competitor. Pablo sends his kids to public school, and has the same amount of kids as his competitor; he goes to the doctor when he is ill, and goes the same amount of times as his competitor; he's an American just like his competitor, and benefits from military defense in the same way; *why on Earth would Pablo have to spend multiple times as much money on these things than his competitor?* I really don't get it, I'm sorry. They utilize the same services in the same exact way, why is Pablo in essence *subsidizing* his competitor's payments just because Pablo is a smarter, more efficient businessman?

- There's a marathon going on in Vermont. Two hundred participants compete for the $1,000 given to first, second, and third place. Each participant puts down $20, which goes toward prize money and ensuring the event is run well. Each winner splits the prize money. At the end of the race, the three winners of first, second, and third place are shocked to find out that they are only taking home $120. The event organizers apparently decided that the winners, despite working harder and simply being better at their craft, and despite equally paying for the organization of the event, should have to pay the other participants for simply existing.

I just don't get it. If I drive to work and pass a bridge, I need to pay the toll because bridges cost money. Great. And perhaps I should pay in proportion to how much I drive, that seems like a good idea as well. But if I make a successful website that utilizes none of the services, and in fact very few services at all, is it not plainly *theft* that a bureaucrat decides where my EARNED money goes? I'd rather donate the money I don't need to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, to environmental causes, to the cure for cancer, but the government seems to be stealing it from me so they can play live-action Battlefield 5: Real Life Edition. 

Someone please explain what I am missing.

The short answer is sustainability.  The government is not in the business of moralizing but it is in the business of survival.

Lets take Uber's request for the first 500K self driving Google cars as an example.  Here we have a company run by *relatively* few people.  With this acquisition alone, it will remove 500K jobs from the job market.  Those people will go on unemployment while they *attempt* to look for more work.  

On the flip side, all of the people working at Uber will make more money and will pay *a little* more in taxes.  But only incrementally so.  Without a progressive tax system, the amount of money generated by the additional tax is not nearly enough to offset the loss from unemployment alone.

That is one example within an entire generation of change.  We're seeing a shift in wealth faster than ever before and without progressive taxation, there just won't be enough money to run the country.  It's not about morality or fairness.  It has nothing to do with anything the politicians say to pander to one side or the other.  It's just survival.","I think you're fundamentally misunderstanding the progressive income tax system.

Everyone pays the exact same amount in taxes per dollar earned.  You're just taxed more on your millionth dollar earned than you are on your first dollar earned.  Thus billionaires and people working at McDonalds pay the same tax rates on their earnings.  It's just that McDonalds workers never get hit the higher brackets, so their average tax rate is lower as a result.  But make no mistake that both people are taxed equally and fairly.

As for your other point about only paying taxes for services you consume, I think you're completely missing the point of government.  Instead of a pizza place where you pay for the pizza you eat, you should think of government more like an insurance company where money is pooled.  **Insurance would be pointless if you only paid for damage to your property.**  Similarly government is pointless if everyone is just covering their individual costs or needs case by case.

Like it or not, we live in a society.  Pooling resources is the best way to pay for the costs of living in a society.",A,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a clear explanation of the progressive income tax system, emphasizing that everyone pays the same amount in taxes per dollar earned and that billionaires and lower-income individuals are taxed equally and fairly. This explanation helps to address the original poster's concerns about fairness in taxation.

Additionally, Reply B uses the analogy of government being like an insurance company where money is pooled, highlighting the importance of pooling resources to pay for the costs of living in a society.

predict-explain,"In the argument against gay marriage, people often use the ‘slippery slope’ argument that it’s legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I’m not interested in arguing whether or not this *will* happen, but why it would be a bad thing if it did. This would be within the context of people being allowed to have multiple marriages, you would not automatically be married to your spouse’s other spouse, although you could choose to do this.

While I personally am not interested in polygamy, what's wrong with it? 

It's natural for humans to live in groups. 'Tribes' or 'family' whatever you would like to call it. I don't see anything wrong with families that have several adults to act as role models for children. I just can't see why it would be detrimental to children to be raised in that environment.

To be allowed to marry you need to be a consenting adult and in being one people can make their own relationship decisions. As long as there isn't a sex bias (e.g. men can have many wives but not the other way around), then I think that people can make their own decision about whether a polygamous relationship is something they want. They retain the right to get divorced if their spouse marries someone else when they want a monogamous marriage, just like people retain the right to get a divorce if their spouse cheats on them.

People sometimes argue against polygamous marriages saying that people are already legally allowed to have polygamous relationships, why get married? Because of the legal privileges associated with it? When I get married the legal benefits of being married are going to be way down on the list of reasons. Getting married is a way to show your love for someone. 

A big argument going against it is that the legality of it would be very complex. I don’t think that’s necessarily the case. If you died your possessions would be divided up amongst your spouses. Your children would either go to their other parent or be claimed by a next of kin who wants them, with fitness to look after them being determined by a court of law. As is the case currently with children whose parents die without leaving a will e.g. should they go to uncle A or uncle B? There are lots of examples of legal contracts which are binding to groups of people, why couldn’t this be applied to marriage? It could be encouraged, or even possibly mandatory, to have pre-nuptial agreements which define legal aspects of the marriage relating to property ownership, etc. prior to getting married if you’re married to more than one person. With current spouses also signing this document.

I’m not really that interested in ethical arguments. Why should one person’s ethics determine how other people live their lives? For example, I don’t think I would ever have an abortion for my own personal ethical reasons. That doesn’t mean that I’m against other people having the option.

I'm really interested to know if anyone has any good arguments against polygamous marriages. I think a lot of people are against them for their own personal ethical reasons, because they don’t want one themselves, rather than for an actually good, justifiable reason.

So please try to CMV! I’m going to try to reply to every direct response to me. I get really p***ed off when people cherry-pick arguments and ignore the ones that don't suit them. If there are a lot of responses it may take a while though so please be patient! But in saying that if you reply purely because I’ve committed to responding; if you put forth a low-effort comment you will get a low-effort answer.

Edit: I'm getting a bit tired so off to bed for me before anyone else comments &amp; I feel obliged to stay up and discuss this some more! I will definitely be back so please keep the discussion going! 

Edit2: Right, there's a fair few replies so I will be going through them. Although a lot of later comments are using arguments that have been used before I'm still determined to reply to all of them. It may take me a while as I unfortunately have other things that I need to be doing, such is life, so I will get to you eventually!

Edit3: I have finally awarded a delta! Apologies to anyone whose comment I missed, but thank you all for being part of the conversation. It was very entertaining and I definitely feel a lot more informed. So you don't have to scroll down &amp; find the explanation for my delta, I'll give it here: 
""While I still think there is nothing wrong with polygamous relationships &amp; the concept of some sort of legal commitment, this couldn't be marriage. You could have some kind of legally binding partnership with multiple partners which has some of the benefits of marriage, such as recognition of the partnership affecting things like visitation rights and a legal claim to be next of kin, but this wouldn't be the same as marriage as we have it now. It's not so much about when people in the marriage are living together, but if things later needed to be taken apart. There is just no way to predict every possibility for a pre-nuptial agreement, and the situation could get so complex that you couldn't have a standard that could be fallen back on every time.""

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","""Wrong"" is a word that pertains to morality. So it's odd that you don't want a moral argument. 

But anyway:

* Is everybody equal in such a marriage? Does it vary depending on the time they've been married?
* Can new people be added?
* How is it structured? Is it 3 women married to a man, do they form a ring, or a mesh?
* Related to the above, how does divorce work? Can it fail due to disagreement?
* Is there a size limit? What if a whole town decides to get married, imagine the work untangling that will be.
* What if one person is in the hospital and there are two others that can make a life or death decision, and disagree?
* There are practical social issues. Eg, rich man gets himself 20 wives. Enough of that will skew the ratio in the community, resulting in some really pissed off people.
* Who do the children belong to?
* The court system will probably need an upgrade. We're talking about dramatically increasing complexity and opportunity for conflict.

I don't oppose the idea in principle, but the practical issues seem to be tough to solve, and I doubt they're about to get worked out tomorrow. Maybe as a society in a decade or two we'll reach some sort of general agreement about what such a thing is supposed to look and work like, but today it doesn't seem like we're there.","The best arguments against polygamy aren't moral-there isn't anything morally wrong with multiple spouses if everyone agrees-they're practical. Marriage is a major status change that you choose to enter with another person. It means the law acknowledges who can visit you in the hospital, make decisions for you if you're sick, raise your kids if you die or make decisions for them if you're absent, who can share your bank account and affect your credit rating, and who gets half your stuff in divorce. Marriage is a major change in your rights and responsibilities towards specific other people. 

When you can only be married to one person at a time, both people have to consent to it. That changes with polygamy. I agree to marry my wife, but what if later she wants to also marry her boyfriend or girlfriend? Can this third partner make decisions for the children I had with my original wife? Does the third partner get part of the property my wife and I accumulated together if they divorce out? Does their debt affect my credit score? With polygamy, your rights and responsibilities towards specific people can change *without* your consent, if one spouse chooses to marry someone else. And what if the new spouse is also married?. You might end up with a lot of people you don't know/didn't choose having the ability to majorly impact your life.

Edit: I see that you respond to these kinds of arguments by suggesting people contract around it, but this isn't a workable solution for marriage. 1) Ideally, marriages last for the rest of your life. 50+ years. There is just no way to foresee and contract for every situation where you will have the opportunity to impact your spouses over that kind of time span. Marriage is fundamentally accepting the risk of future uncertainties with another person, of having to deal with the unforeseen together. That's why it's so important that people explicitly agree to the person they take that risk with. They can't effectively contract for all the unknowns and separate risks, and they might not want to be bound by the exact terms of an agreement they signed 20 years ago anyway. Love lives are not great places for contracts. 2) Even in the seemingly simple areas where you would think you can contract, you can't. Like with property, income doesn't stay separated once it comes in  to the household, and in divorce judges try to compensate people who sacrificed career opportunities in service of the family unit. There is no neat way to divide it into fractions or to give that paper fraction actual meaning out of your household property and bank account, and it will inevitably impact the spouse who did not marry the third spouse. Prenups between relatively simple two-spouse marriages are overturned, redrafted, or declared void all the time; the sense of predictability they offer is illusive, especially if you move states (every state has its own divorce laws). They wouldn't help much at all with polygamous marriages.

Things can go wrong with your spouse, but you consented to the risk by marrying them.
Things can go wrong with your children, but you accepted that risk by having and keeping children.
Things go wrong with your spouse's spouse, and you didn't have to sign up for it to ruin your credit or garnish your wages or otherwise massively impact your life. That's an issue, and it can't be easily solved by introducing more contracts into personal relationships.",B,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a detailed explanation of the practical issues that can arise with polygamous marriages, focusing on the potential for changes in rights and responsibilities without consent, the complexity of managing multiple relationships over time, and the challenges of contractually addressing all potential scenarios. This response highlights the potential pitfalls and complications that can arise in polygamous marriages, which may give the original poster pause and prompt them to reconsider their stance.

On the other hand, Reply A also raises practical concerns about polygamous marriages, but it does not delve as deeply into the specific challenges and implications as Reply B does. Reply A focuses more on the logistical issues that can arise with polygamous marriages, such as decision-making, child custody, and legal complexities, without providing as much depth in the analysis.

Overall, Reply B presents a more thorough and compelling argument against polygamous marriages, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."

Gender dysphoria is often visible in an fMRI as those with it will have the same brain structure of their chosen gender but the sex organs of the other gender.","Well when it comes to gender dysphoria, gender is used to mean something more like ""how i perceive myself/how i think i should be"", rather than like ""masculinity and femininity"", which is how its usually used. These are sometimes split up into ""gender identity"" and ""gender roles"". (Most of the time,) when someone wants to transition, it's not about wanting to fit in with the more masculine/feminine gender role, its about being uncomfortable with their biological sex, and wanting to fix that. Transsexual has obvious connotations with sexual orientations like homosexual though, and people use the term transgender to avoid that.

Theres some evidence that gender identity is rooted in the brain, and assuming that's true, it exists in a fairly definable way. Gender roles and masculinity/femininity exist more as a concept, and can vary greatly between cultures. In that way ""gender"" doesn't really exist in any absolute, definable way.",B,B,"I believe Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides scientific evidence and explanations of the biological basis of gender, specifically mentioning brain structure differences between genders and how gender dysphoria can be seen in fMRIs. This scientific evidence may help the original poster understand that gender identity is not just about societal norms or roles, but also has a biological component. This may help the original poster see gender dysphoria in a different light and potentially change their view on the topic."

In fact, given my regional location (the South or Southeast United States) it has probably hurt me personally more than anything.

I have not read Ayn Rand, nor do I ever intend to, as I consider her philosophy to be frankly immoral.  Moral people should look out for their fellow humans.

However, I believe that I would be better served by pursuing my own rational self-interest rather than spending even an ounce of my resources on the betterment of others who will just attribute my good deed to their god anyway most likely.

holy fucking shit the bugs aaaaaaaaa

#In the country, everything is high maintenance.

Since just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.","&gt;there is a greater range of things to do

I would greatly dispute this.  Few cities have any decent opportunities for hiking, kayaking, sailing, hunting, trapping, fishing, birding, shooting, or a great deal of other activities.  When I find myself in a city for whatever reasons, I find myself quickly getting bored due to the lack of interesting things to do.

&gt;There are theatres

Small towns have those too.

&gt;large public events

This is a negative to me.  I can only think of one large public event that I enjoy, and it involves camping.

&gt;strip clubs

Don't need or want them.

&gt;meetings of like-minded people and clubs

These are pretty easy to find out in the country.

&gt;just about anything to do if you ever get bored

Like I stated before, cities have a severe lack of most of the sorts of things I like doing.

&gt;Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity

This can also effectively be achieved by having a mile or so in between your house and your neighbour's.  You never have to see another human if you don't want to.  Cities are just so crowded and there are people everywhere.  In a city, I feel like I can't snese without accidentally invading someone's space, and I certainly have no hope of having no one invade mine.  In the right place country, I could set off a bomb and no one would give a shit.

&gt;bugs

&gt;holy fucking shit the bugs

This is actually a major plus to me.  In the city, I'm lucky to see a single Black Saddlebags, but in the country I can see a wide range of different insects.  As someone with a fascination for entomology, this is a fantastic experience to me.  The only bugs I don't like are things like gnats and mosquitoes, but you get those in cities just as much as you do in the country.  Maybe even more so, depending on the place.

&gt;In the country, everything is high maintenance.

&gt;Since just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.

Sounds like you are making stuff up.  I have not experienced any appliances having significantly shorter lives in the country.  It is pretty easy to keep things clean even living far from other people.  Living in the country is not the same as camping.

Overall, I can't imagine ever being able to live in a city.  Most cities I measure how long I can stand to be in them in hours (the best cities rate days).  A few cities I would only be able to stand a few minutes and at least one I found so terrible that I refuse to ever go there again.

Edit:  I forgot to point out the most important one: ""Everything is closer in the city"".  I love having space and having things further apart means more space.  Having things closer together is a big negative to me and is the main reason that I would not be able to ever stand living in the city.","&gt;I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone.

Honestly, this just shows a lack of maturity and a fundamental lack of knowledge about the human condition. 

&gt;Cities have bigger and better libraries

OK... but I don't need a big library. I just need a kiosk that is part of the intra-library loan program. When I want to read a book, I do it from home.

&gt;schools

This is rather obviously not the case. Public schools in major cities are cesspools, and achieve worse results with more funding than suburban or rural schools. 

&gt;police/fire departments

I don't know of any way to measure this, other than to say that my sheriff's office has cleared 100% of the homicides in my county in the last 10 years... how's your city doing in that regard?

&gt;hospitals

Sure

&gt;gas

I've got some bad news for you, there, bucko. Gas, both of the gasoline and natural varieties, is cheaper in the country. 

&gt;internet

I'm at the edge of a small city, so I get to partake of their municipal broadband. I pay $34.99 a month for 50/5. No caps or bullshit or trying to sell my information to the highest bidder either. When I have an issue, I call a local phone number than is answered by a local tech. The one time I've had to have a tech come out to my house, I called at noon and he was there by 1:30. 

I mean this in the nicest possible way, but I'm kicking your ass in this regard. Might want to try again. 

&gt;As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first.

I've had 4G LTE since 2012. And it's fast. Much faster than yours, as a matter of fact, since I have significantly less traffic congestion. 

&gt;A really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops.

OK... and? You telling me that Amazon has geographic cutoffs?

&gt;Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties.

I haven't been to an indoor mall in damn near a decade, and I see no reason to change this. A mall is one of the last things I'd consider a positive. 

One of the best restaurants I've ever been to was the Old Miner's Inn in Alba, MO, population 555. Michelin 3 star French cuisine. Phenomenal. 

Another personal favorite is the Craftwood Inn in Manitou Springs, Colorado, population 5,245.

&gt;There are theatres

There are theatres everywhere. Even in small towns. Those movin' pictures sure are cool!

&gt; large public events

We have those too, but I have to tell you, I hate crowds, and have less than zero interest in going to a large public event. 

&gt;strip clubs

You're seriously listing this as a positive? *Come to Metropolis, we have more strip clubs per capita than any other city in the US!*

&gt;meetings of like-minded people

I've got some more news for you. You have meetings of like-minded people everywhere. All that's required for said meeting is for several like-minded people to locate one another. 

&gt;clubs 

Please see my previous comment about crowds

&gt;just about anything to do if you ever get bored

I've lived in the country for more than 15 years now, and I can't say that I've ever been bored. I'd guess that one big difference between myself and a denzien of, say, NYC, is that the activities I choose to entertain myself mainly occur outside.

&gt;There's a convenience store on just about every corner.

It saddens me that you view this as a good thing. I personally find this worse than the previous comment about strip clubs. 

&gt;If you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares.

Well, the co-op board sure does. And the nosy neighbors that I am now forced to share a wall with do. 

&gt;If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a new neighbor that they wanna get to know and everything.

Heaven forbid that people want to be friendly, as opposed to smacking the ceiling with a broom handle and telling you to turn down your music. 

&gt;Even if you abstain from social interaction, you become ""that weird neighbor that abstains from social interaction."" 

As opposed to the weirdo in 4C that has his groceries delivered and hasn't left his apartment in 2 years? And have you walked by there lately? The SMELL!

&gt;This tends to temper individualism, and it's not like you can ""just spend time with the people you like,"" because rumors and all travel fast with a community that small.

predict-explain,"There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is that the vote should be your own, informed choice, rather than letting someone else make the decision for you.


Point 1 - http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-verification-without-id-documents.aspx
The ncsl site details some terribly inefficient and time consuming ways to verify someone's identity without an ID. Time needs to be used to look up data and then more time needs to be spent comparing data. And then more time after that when things dont match up and you have to fix / argue your want through.

Point 2 - I have trouble understanding the argument about how requiring IDs to vote is discriminatory in a bad way. The argument is that requiring an ID would discourage poor people from voting. Even the poorest citizens engage smoking and drinking, which are activities that they probably have been asked for an ID for. I find it inconceivable that someone without an ID would be someone capable of making an informed vote. If you couldn't find the time out of all the years in your life and maybe 10 dollars to get an ID, then I believe that you are the exact type of irresponsible person who should not be voting at all.

Point 3 - There are long lines at voting and requiring IDs would cut it down. The government requires employers to pay workers while they take off to go vote. I can think of many employers who will tell you to take the whole day off rather than pay you a full day for half a day's work. This is a partially broken law which only works for full time employees. Part time employees, which generally make less money, often cannot take advantage of this. I'd make the argument that by not requiring ID's to vote, they are discriminating against people whose time is more valuable than voting. I believe the best way to encourage voting is to make voting easier and less time consuming. 

Point 4 - Perhaps instead of trying to tackle enormously expensive projects like free healthcare and free college, we can start with the easy and low cost / high benefit ones like free ID cards.","This only exists to screen out voters. You yourself admit in points 2 and 3 that you're not only trying to reduce the total number of voters, but prevent the wrong kind of person from voting. This is a blatantly undemocratic point of view. Citizens should not have their basic rights revoked just for not carrying a small piece of plastic with them. It seems obvious, but it needed to be said. 

There are zero upsides to requiring ID. You know why illegal immigrants won't vote in the 2016 elections? Because they're not registered with the government as eligible voters. We already have a system to prevent voter fraud, and putting up bouncers at polls is just redundant. 

And on top of being redundant, ID law wouldn't solve the ways that voter fraud currently is perpetrated. Voting machine tampering, vote buying, and fraudulent absentee ballots are a problem in our system, and would never be addressed by voter ID. The only thing that would is ""voter impersonation"". If you've never heard of it that's because it occurs at a [rate next to zero](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2014/08/06/a-comprehensive-investigation-of-voter-impersonation-finds-31-credible-incidents-out-of-one-billion-ballots-cast/). According to politifact, for every instances of voter impersonation, there are [207 cases of other forms of voter fraud.](http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/sep/19/naacp/-person-voter-fraud-very-rare-phenomenon/) Using voter ID to try to stop voter fraud is like turning on a dehumidifier on the Titanic. 

The downsides obviously outweigh the upsides. Voter ID compromises our democratic tenets and adds unnecessary and incompetent bureaucracy to voting stations.","It's worth noting that many elderly African Americans were born outside of hospitals due to Segregation, and were never given birth certificates.  Many African Americans also have names misspelled or birthdays wrongly listed on birth certificates.  The ""separate"" black hospitals back in the 50's and 60's weren't quite ""equal"" to the white hospitals at this paperwork.  It seems particularly cruel that a group that's only been able to vote for 50 years will now have to jump through hoops, bureaucracy, and complicated paperwork to exercise this right. 

I disagree that free ID cards is a low cost/high benefit solution.  Hundreds of millions of dollars spent to combat a non-existent voter fraud problem seems like a high cost for no benefit.  Furthermore, it doesn't solve the early voting/absentee voting fraud potential, which probably is a much easier and safer way to commit voter fraud.  

Finally, lines at voting stations could be fixed by hiring more employees or opening more stations.  These long lines are often blamed on partisan decisions to intentionally suppress low income and minority votes, and this problem wouldn't necessarily go away with more IDs.",B,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a thorough argument against the original poster's points, highlighting the undemocratic nature of voter ID laws, the redundancy of such laws in preventing voter fraud, and the potential negative impacts on voter turnout. The reply also provides evidence to support their claims and effectively counters the original poster's arguments. Reply A's argument is well-reasoned and logical, making it more likely to sway the original poster's opinion."
predict-explain,"People who have no interest in politics, and are not interested in learning about the candidates and issues should not be encouraged to vote under the pretense that it its their ""patriotic duty"" or that they are ""supposed to"". I believe it is the duty of all citizens eligible for voting to do so, but only as informed citizens. If they are unwilling to become informed, they should not be encouraged to vote. Please note that this does not mean that their right to vote should be infringed, simply that other people should not encourage them to do so.
EDIT: to clarify what I would consider the standard to be for a low information voter: Someone who has watched none of the various political debates leading up to the election, and cannot differentiate what major policies/beliefs are traditionally associated with which party.","I think, as with all views on issues with democracy, that it helps to understand what the purpose of democracy is: It's not to get a good form of government that synthesizes all of the best ideas of all of the people to result in an optimal outcome.

A competent, benevolent dictator can be more or less proven to be a better way to achieve the ""best"" government. The problem is that dictatorial systems always eventually lead to a bad dictator, and a big reason for this is lack of checks and balances.

The purpose of democracy is to prevent bad dictators. It's to be a check and balance on oppressive and terrible government. That's all. It's pretty terrible at anything else, but luckily that seems to be enough.

People should vote whenever they feel that it's important to vote, for whatever reason, because that's how we execute the checks and balances on government that democracy enshrines. 

You can be the stupidest, most ignorant person in the world, but if you're offended by something the government does, and you want to replace it (even with an random choice), then you are serving the purpose of democracy by voting: preventing bad dictators.","It seems like you're saying two different things here. I agree that the argument that someone should vote purely because it's their patriotic duty is a pretty poor one. 

But people that have little interest in politics shouldn't be discouraged from voting, they should be simultaneously encouraged to vote and to educate themselves about the candidates before doing so. 

There are numerous quizzes online so that even the incredibly lazy can best match their views to a candidate that shares them by answering questions on key issues. There's no reason why someone should be discouraged from voting due to lack of knowledge or interest when the option exists to help them cultivate knowledge or interest.",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view.

Speaking of which,* ***[downvotes don't change views](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/guidelines#wiki_upvoting.2Fdownvoting)****!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","Let me start by saying I'm a fan of Win *8.1* (the .1 being the key there).  And still appreciate what Win8 was trying to do.  So my arguments more or less here are to understand why there are a lot of people who hate it.  I think it's also worth mentioning that Win8 brings a lot of great things to the table (new explorer, new task manager, better under the hood performance, etc) but depending on the person, they probably don't care.

&gt; The main complaint seems to be the start screen replacing the start menu.

The problem is that it's considered a really jarring experience for a lot of people, and they don't like that.  So in order to access your programs in Win7 if they weren't pinned to the bar you could just open up the menu while still having a complete view of the desktop.  With Win8 however, going into the Start Screen completely tears you out of your working environment so you can access your programs not pinned to the bar.  So for some that only have a handful of programs pinned to their Start it's incredibly annoying to have an *entire* screen fill up your desktop rather than a small menu on the side.

Another issue (which I still kinda have with it, even though it doesn't happen often) is when you accidentally hit the Win key it pulls you out of whatever you're working on and into a completely different screen.  In Win7 if this happened all you'd see is the menu pop up and you'd just click off it to get back to work.  In Win8 you have to find the Desktop tile and click that, or strike the key again.  The process is non-ideal.

I also feel that it could have been executed a lot better as far as tile organization goes.  You can do two sizes, and stack them in a column.  I think they should have taken the ""snap to grid"" approach for icons on the desktop to allow you to stick tiles anywhere on the Start screen rather than just form columns and hope they align with your OCD.

&gt;  if you really hate it you can install something like classic shell to bring back to the start menu

I'm an advocate of this, however you have to remember that the majority of PC users are *not* incredibly bright.  So for instance if my father wanted to get a new laptop then he's got to figure all that stuff out on his own (not likely), I need to babysit him through the process on the phone, or I need to just do it myself.  And since it's a third party software, it's possible that it'll break for one reason or another in which case either he's got to fix it (not likely) or I need to fix it (annoying).

&gt; To change my view here you should tell me if there's something worse than the start screen in Windows 8 that makes it that bad. Or if the start screen really is that bad.

So depends on who you are.  I don't mind the Start screen but there are a lot of people who absolutely *loathe* it.

Other things wrong with Win8:

 - Charms menu.  Every time my cursor wanders over to a corner I get an annoying Charms menu pop up.  If I have a multi monitor setup (which I do now) if I *do* want to get to the Charms I have to balance my cursor between screens, making it nearly impossible to get on a single try.  It's also kinda useless.  I've nearly forgotten it's there on my desktop since all of its functionality is available elsewhere (at least from what I've used).
 - Lack of Start button (fixed with 8.1).  In Win8 there was no Start button, so the only way to get to the Start menu was hitting the Win key or going all the way to the corner with the cursor.  Annoying.
 - Shut down (fixed in 8.1, kinda).  In Win8 if you want to restart/shut down/sleep it's a several key/click process.  You need to get to the start menu, then open the charms bar, then select settings, then power options, then select what you wanna do.  It's a kind of hidden process, and really annoying if you don't know how to do it.  Once you do know, you think ""why is this a several step process when it should be like Win7?"".  Win 8.1 *kinda* fixes this by allowing you direct access with a right click of the Start button, or directly on the Start Screen.  I say *kinda* because a right click is non-ideal and non-obvious and putting it on the Start screen means you still need to use the Start Screen.
 - Direct to Start Screen on boot (fixed in 8.1, with a settings change).  Booting up goes right to the Start Screen rather than the desktop.  Annoying.  Fixed with a settings option in 8.1, but it should be default.
 - Full screen apps (kinda fixed with 8.1).  Full screen apps on a desktop (or even laptop) are a terrible idea.  Win 8.1 kinda fixes this by docking them on the taskbar, but full screen apps are still a terrible idea.  They need to be windowed or the option to have them windowed, period.  For someone who wants to look at more than one thing (laptop and desktop users) having Mail taking up your entire screen is a drag.
 - General hidden features.  Things that should be obvious are hidden.  You need to hunt a corner to pop a menu out, accessing ""all apps"" from the Start Screen there's a *hidden* arrow button, right clicking contextually to find things (like the shut down point before) etc.  Not to mention all the stuff buried in the Charms bar.  There's too much hidden stuff that's only nice if you already know where it is.
 - General touch-oriented approach.  A lot of stuff is designed with touch in mind, like the Tiles.  Great if you have a touchscreen, and janky looking if you don't. 
 - Too much tied in with MS.  They really try to get you to make an MS account, and tie your login with said account.  I absolutely hate that.  It makes things like Onedrive on the desktop inaccessible because of this integration, as opposed to just having the application take whatever credentials it needs.  If you chose to shirk making and signing in with an MS account, you lose some of the perks Win8 brings to the table.
 - Multiple PC settings areas.  So you've got the standard Control Panel, then you've got this ""Settings"" area that has some repetition from Control Panel, then some other stuff not in Control Panel that should be integrated into just Control Panel.  It's also a full screen app...ughhhh.  So if you wanna set something, you have to hunt through an already kinda cryptic Control Panel, but also through this new Settings app.
 - Repetition of functionality.  There's a lot of different ways to do one thing.  Shut down is yet again an example of this.  Device management is another (Control Panel, Settings app, Charms bar).  Search is another (Win+S, Start menu then type something, Charms bar).  There is way too much repetition.

So all in all, if you're not a savvy user (like most) then updating is a real pain in the ass.  8.1 does fix a lot of flaws 8 had, and Win10 supposedly brings a lot of that stuff even closer to Win7 (Start menu).  Win10 is what Win8 should have been.

And in reality, there's ways around just about every nit up there.  Problem is, that if you have to find a way around something in order to get to experience the better things and improvements Win8 has to offer then that's a bad thing and deserving of a lot of the hate that Win8 has garnered.","In 1994-1995, there were a bunch of ""alternative shell"" programs launched for Windows 3.1. Most prominent among them were Microsoft Bob and Packard Bell Navigator.

They were intended to make computers simpler, friendlier, easier to use thanks to more familiar UI elements.

They were a massive failure, in part because their supposedly-intuitive UIs were anything but, and in part because they were so limited—a lot of functionality was buried, you had no idea what you could or couldn't interact with or what anything would do, and you just couldn't do certain things without exiting the ""friendly"" UI and returning to the real OS.

Windows 8 is that, but worse. It's grafted into the OS, rather than merely overlaying it. It's mostly ignorable, but there's just enough designed-for-touchscreen elements (which are explained... once... the first time the computer ever turns on while running that version of Windows) that are vital to day-to-day life that you can't just pretend it doesn't exist. Like the Charms menu in order to reboot or power down, or tying the native web browser and SkyDrive to the new ""modern"" UI, or the nightmare that is trying to sort the start screen. Even if you like the new start screen—I personally think it looks pretty nifty—it's not really very *good.* (I always preferred Launchy to the Start Menu, so that wasn't a problem for me, but it's certainly a problem for a lot of other people.)

And that half-baked, Frankenstein's monster of a solution was really a shame. I liked Windows 8. I still like Windows 8, and I'm looking forward to Windows 10—the improvements to network file sharing code, file move/copy, the task manager, and overall RAM use are all really good benefits, and bumping my work computer from 7 to 10 is going to be a delight. But 8 was badly-designed software, even if you could ignore most of the bad parts if you knew what you were doing.",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides a detailed explanation of the specific issues with Windows 8, such as the jarring experience of the Start screen, the difficulty in accessing programs, and the various hidden features that can be frustrating for users. The reply also addresses potential solutions, such as installing third-party software like classic shell, but also acknowledges the challenges that less tech-savvy users may face in doing so. Overall, Reply A presents a comprehensive and well-reasoned argument against Windows 8, which is more likely to convince the original poster to reconsider their view."
predict-explain,"Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by rational means, rather than a mixture of reason, emotion, tradition, religion, evolutionary instinct etc. I will use one clear example, for the sake of focus, while knowing that there are other examples of this as well. I will talk about producing off-spring.

In my experience, people against procreating articulate 3-4 arguments against having children. Firstly, that having children will detrimentally affect the environment (1). New humans means more consumers of the Earth's resources and more producers of waste. The long term viability of the earth with exponentially more consumers and producers is uncertain.  Secondly, the cost of having children can be astronomical (2). Thirdly, you become isolated to your social circle and to your spouse due to the time need to take care of your child. 

I present these arguments not because they uniquely matter, but because they seem valid. They are, shall we say for the sake of argument, true.  However, in the pursuit of being rational, these arguments have contradicted one of the most basic and scientific principles of life, namely that animals produce off-spring to survive. It is basic evolutionary biology. We observe this in every known creature; we observe our own instincts to sexual activity and pleasure; we observe people's special fondness to babies (3). Yet, despite this obvious teology of humans, the rational arguments are given preference. This seems to play out on the societal level. Education levels and industrialization (a proxy for culture/rationality) correlate with lower birth rates (4). 

In conclusion, this is but one of many examples where hyper-rationality creates a social pressure that contradicts human instinct.

For example, are humans even remotely rational when it comes to voting? Most seem to vote for whoever seems to be ""of their tribe"" (intellectuals, or go-getters, or soldiers or southerners, etc.) with very little analysis of policy. Or heck, just vote for whoever is tall and has a convincing smile, a nice suit, and a slogan with a couple feel-good words.

Or how is watching dreck on TV ""hyper-rational""? Or spending money on an impressive car or handbag, or doing drugs, or arguing with people on the internet, etc.?

To get back to the birth example, I think it can be explained perfectly well witjout ""hyper rationality"" - people respond to incentives, and the incentive in the modern world (especially in a city) are very different from those of most of our more fertile ancestors. Put in our shoes, they would probably also choose to have less kids, for the same reasons we do: contraception is available; living space is very expensive; education is expensive; women work; there are many more other things on which one is tempted to spend money; hardly anybody has a job at which kids can be of any help, etc.","There is a different between someone's proposed reasons for doing something and their actual reasons for doing something. A person who doesn't want to have a child might justify their decision with all the things you mentioned, but due to social pressure might fail to mention that they dislike children and that's why they're choosing not to have them. The other considerations like finances are just a plus. So, when you say that people have a special fondness for babies, you are not taking into account the fact that many people don't, or that there are other things they value far more highly (like a commitment to the environment that brings them fulfillment and purpose).

&gt;Technically kids and babies are allowed on /r/aww, but they generally get downvoted to hell which I find kind of amusing. Once in a while kids can be cute or do cute things, but the newborn baby pictures are kind of gross.

...


I also suggest r/childfree for a celebration of people who are following their instincts by NOT having children. They are bucking a strong societal pressure to live their lives like they actually want to. Is this due to an increasingly rational society? Possibly. But they are not fighting their animal nature.

There is still a strong social pressure to procreate even if your circumstances make it an irrational choice, and you'll find examples of that on the subreddit. To say that higher education and industrialization (your rationality proxy) results in a lower birthrate because people are making a rational decision to not have children despite their desire to doesn't make much sense in light of Sweden. They put a lot of effort as a country into supporting parents and children http://www.oecd.org/els/family/swedenssupportforparentswithchildreniscomprehensiveandeffectivebutexpensive.htm

yet they still have a birthrate comparable to developed nations that supply far less support to parents. http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN

...

Rationality doesn't seem to be causing people to completely dismiss their emotional desire to have children in most cases. All of the other factors of emotion, tradition, religion, etc are still very much at play. Perhaps more people now value the environment more highly than religious doctrine in their decision to have children, but to say that people all people who choose not to have children for an environmental reason are contradicting their instinct to do so is demonstrably false.",A,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more nuanced and detailed response, highlighting the fact that there may be underlying reasons for not wanting to have children that go beyond just rational arguments. By bringing up the subreddit r/childfree and discussing how some individuals simply do not have a fondness for babies, Reply B challenges the original poster's assertion that human instinct always drives people to procreate. Additionally, Reply B brings up the example of Sweden and how their high level of support for parents does not necessarily result in a higher birth rate, suggesting that rationality alone may not be the sole factor influencing decisions about having children.

Overall, Reply B's response takes into account a wider range of factors and provides specific examples to support their argument, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"Currently, [it is a crime to lie to any federal officer.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001)  It is an astoundingly severe crime too, carrying a maximum sentence up to *five years in prison.*  Under the current law, it is a very serious felony to make any materially false statement to any federal agent.

This law is routinely abused by the government to give them leverage over defendants.  [Ken White at Popehat describes how:](http://popehat.com/2011/12/01/reminder-oh-wont-you-please-shut-up/)

&gt;Here's how it works. The feds identify some fact that they can prove. It need not be inherently incriminating; it might be whether you were at a particular meeting, or whether you talked to someone about the existence of the investigation. They determine that they have irrefutable proof of this fact. Then, when they interview you, they ask you a question about the fact, hoping that you will lie. Often they employ professional questioning tactics to make it more likely you will lie — for instance, by phrasing the question or employing a tone of voice to make the fact sound sinister. You — having already been foolhardy enough to talk to them without a lawyer — obligingly lie about this fact. Then, even though there was never any question about the fact, even though your lie did not deter the federal government for a microsecond, they have you nailed for a false statement to a government agent in violation of 18 USC 1001. To be a crime under Section 1001, a statement must be material — but the federal courts have generally supported the government's position that the question is not whether a false statement actually did influence the government, but whether it was the sort of false statement that could have influenced the government.

&gt;Hence, the government's chickenshit false statement trap works — even though the government agents set it up from the start. Now, however weak or strong their evidence is of the issue they are investigating, they've got you on a Section 1001 charge — a federal felony. In effect, they are manufacturing felonies in the course of investigations.

I think there should be no crime here unless it can be proven that the falsehood actually impeded an investigation in a meaningful manner.  Also, I think the penalty should be much less severe, more like a misdemeanor.

What I found is a large body of case law annotating § 1001 and reversing convictions for lack of materiality.  Upon a reading of these cases I do not believe that your example here: 

&gt; They ask questions which they know the answers to, can prove are lies, **and which the only purpose of asking is to get a 1001 charge.**

particularly because of the bolded portion, would support a conviction.  In other words, I believe the materiality requirement is taken quite seriously by the courts and acts as a safeguard which in most cases would prevent the abuse you are concerned about.  

There are an awful lot of cases dealing with this issue, published and unpublished, but here are a few quotes I thought most relevant and concise:

&gt; [T]he purpose of the materiality requirement of section 1001 is to exclude trivial falsehoods from the purview of the statute, since false statements that lack the capacity to influence a determination required to be made [by the agency] are too trivial to violate the statute.

&gt; From the statutory history, it is evident that section 1001 was not intended to reach all false statements made to governmental agencies and departments, but only those false statements that might support fraudulent claims against the Government, or that might pervert or corrupt the authorized functions of those agencies to whom the statements were made. Typical of the kind of statements that are within the purview of section 1001 are false reports of crime made to federal law enforcement agencies that may engender groundless federal investigations.  The statute was not intended to embrace oral, unsworn statements, unrelated to any claim of the declarant to a privilege from the United States or to a claim against the United States, given in response to inquiries initiated by a federal agency or department, except, perhaps, where such a statement will substantially impair the basic functions entrusted by law to that agency.

*United States v. Bedore*, 455 F.2d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir. 1972)

&gt; Deciding whether a statement is ""material"" requires the determination of at least two subsidiary questions of purely historical fact: (a) ""what statement was made?"" and (b) ""what decision was the agency trying to make?""

*United States v. Gaudin*, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (U.S. 1995)

So if the FBI is asking you a question ""which the only purpose of asking is to get a 1001 charge,"" then a false response could not be material.  The state would need to prove that they were required to make some determination (in the case of the FBI, the resolution of a criminal investigation), that they asked you something in furtherance of the investigation, and that you knowingly gave a false response calculated to deceive them in a manner that would influence the outcome of the investigation.

Lots of legalese in there but I'm happy to discuss or post more!","IANAL but I think this is already included in the law. The law makes a misrepresentation of a **material** fact illegal. This means that the prosecutor has to demonstrate that the statement was false and that the false statement mattered to the investigation in a meaningful way. 

So I don't think lying to the FBI is a crime in the case where the lie does not matter.",A,A,Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides specific examples and quotes from case law that support the argument that the materiality requirement in the law acts as a safeguard against abuse. The user also explains how the courts take the materiality requirement seriously and provides a clear explanation of what needs to be proven for a conviction under § 1001. Reply A addresses the concerns raised by the original poster and provides a strong argument based on legal precedent.
predict-explain,"First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and I can admit when I am wrong.

I do not buy into the whole argument of 'just because our parents brought us into the world, we owe them our lives.' Whether a child was brought into the world by choice or not, I don't think that being born should impose a debt of respect on the child. 

Furthermore, I think that this respect needs to be earned. I define respect in this context as 'regard for another person's rational ability, trusting that they can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out.'

This is why I think that giving the reason 'because I said so' is a total cop out. If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect. 

Don't get me wrong, I think it is crucial for a child to be told when they are wrong so that they don't grow up into narcissistic asshats. However, I think that they deserve a logical conversation with a parent until one side admits, of his own accord, that he is in the wrong.

But there are several aspects that I'd like to comment on.

First of all, your parents changed your diapers and by the time you're even just 5, they've invested a whole lot of time and money in you. That is enough to deserve some respect and gratitude. That doesn't mean they can't lose it because they do crappy things, but it is worth quite a bit in itself, and it does deserve respect.

In the case of arguments, there's two points that I think are important. First of all, you'll have found that there are many situations in life where ""because I said so"" is something you'll have to submit to if you want to achieve certain goals. Ever had a job? Ever had a boss who told you what to do? Did they always talk you through the reasons for the required actions step by step? It would be nice if they did, because even in a job I'd quite like to know why I'm doing what I'm doing, but they're not required to because they give you money.

If your parents say you can't wear a cap at the table because they said so, then that's fair enough. They're feeding you. You're free to get up and move out and buy your own food, but as long as they're providing for you, they can make rules, even if the rules are stupid and arbitrary and you don't agree with them. I personally don't think that's a very good attitude and I hope I won't be that kind of parent, but I can't really argue with it.

Also, I've had similar conversations with parents because, as I said, I do in principle agree with you, and I'd very much like to be a parent who explains things to their children and encourages them not to take things for granted or as given without questioning them. But I've been told that this just gets tedious sometimes. Maybe you spend 15 hours a day actively dealing with your child. Children ask all the questions and want to do all the things, and if you at some point run out of patience and don't want to explain something for the nth time, I think saying ""because I said so"" is still not ideal, but perfectly understandable. 

With your last statement, I'm not sure which age you have in mind. But people of any age really sometimes suck at logic, and children even more so, so there are arguments that can't be solved this way because no side will admit out of their own accord that they're wrong. And in some cases there isn't even necessarily wrong or right, because it depends on how much you care about certain things. You can't drag arguments out forever. You need to get on with your life at some point.","&gt; This is why I think that giving the reason 'because I said so' is a total cop out. If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect.

I think you will find that as a parent, this would be an impossible situation. You say that ""respect needs to be earned"", but isn't this a two way street? Maybe you think the parent who says ""because I said so"" hasn't done enough to earn the child's respect. But has the child done anything to earn respect either? If the parent tried to rationally explain why they're right to the child, how confident are you that the child will understand and ""can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out"". If they can't, then a rational two-way discussion just isn't going to happen.

And if such a discussion can't happen yet, what now? Should the parent and child just ""agree to disagree""? Of course not. I wouldn't frame it as some kind of ""debt"" that arises out of giving birth, but I think its pretty widely acknowledged that parents are responsible for their child's behavior, even before the child is wise enough to understand complicated reasoning. As a third part, I *expect* other parents to keep their children in line, even if their children aren't smart enough to understand why certain behavioral expectations exist.

And similar phenomena happen for all positions of authority. If a police officer is directing traffic, he doesn't have to explain to you the details of what's going on. You have to listen to him anyway. ""Because I said so"" would be a perfectly reasonable thing for him to say when him explaining what's going on in more detail would hold up traffic (especially if you then decide for whatever reason that you disagree). Similarly, there are many employer-employee relationships where ""because I said so"" should be good enough for you. One hopes that there is a good reason behind the requests, but the employee is in no way entitled to a full breakdown of exactly why everything works the way it does, especially when time is of the essence. Its embedded into the nature of these relationships that you follow orders.",B,A,"I would say that Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a more nuanced perspective on the issue, acknowledging the importance of the parent-child relationship and the responsibilities that come with it. The user also brings up valid points about the practicalities of parenting and the necessity of setting boundaries and rules, even if they may seem arbitrary to the child. This response also addresses the idea of respect being earned and the challenges of constantly explaining decisions to children.

On the other hand, while Reply B makes some valid points about the nature of authority and the practicality of certain situations, it does not delve as deeply into the complexities of the parent-child relationship and the nuances of earning respect. It focuses more on the practical aspects of authority and obedience, which may not resonate as much with someone who is questioning the traditional notion of parental authority."
predict-explain,"The only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. If you have a nose that is 2 1/2 inches long and crushed in eye socket, then yes, you have an out. 

However, if you are not disfigured, and your facial syemetry is average, and you are still considered unattractive, well then it's your fault. 

Are you overweight? Your fault. 

Do you dress like a 35 year old male who still lives in his mom's basement, and wears black velcro shoes?  Your fault. 

Are you balding? Depending on the structure of your skull, this is debatable, but you can take steps to mitigate this that don't involve a comb over. Halfway your fault. 

Do you have acne? Take better care of your skin. There are some miracle acne drugs out there. Your fault. 

Do you only wear shit tier clothes every single day because their ""comfortable""? Your fault. 

Do you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you have no concept of fashion? Your fault. 

Do you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you can't afford decent clothes? Work harder, go back to school, still your fault. 

Ladies, do you not wear makeup because it takes too much effort to apply? Your fault. If makeup didn't work there wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar industry surrounding it. 

Do you smell like ass because you don't take a shower every day, use deodorant, and wear cologne/perfume? Your fault. 

Do you have a shit tier job because you have a degree in History? Your fault. 

Men, do you not shave your unibrow/nose hair? Your fault. 

Nearly any excuse you can give for why you are unattractive is something you can control for and therefore makes it your fault. I do not presume to say that taking all these steps will make someone a 10/10 but if you are a 2/10, I firmly believe you can go to a 7/10. Everyone can be a 7/10 out of ten. Again, this bars physical characteristics that you have no control over. If you're a 4'10 male, it's not your fault, you just have shitty height genetics. 

Also I am not saying being attractive is easy. It takes a lot of work and a lot of self improvement. 

Finally, this post isn't supposed to make anyone feel good. I am fully aware of how douchy it sounds. Spare me the hateful pm's.","A lot of those things you mentioned (acne treatment, fashionable clothes, hair treatment, gym membership to lose weight) require money. Since being poor isn't the poor person's fault (in most situations), I'd say being ""unattractive"" because you can't afford things that would make you ""attractive"" isn't your fault. You might say ""they should work harder, go to school, and get a better job,"" but I don't think their looks will be the first thing they spend their new salary on.","This article will support your premise that few people if any are beyond looking attractive -- given the right treatments.http://www.themysteryworld.com/2012/04/there-are-no-ugly-women-only-poor-ones.html?m=1

However, your stipulation that it's ""their fault"" if they are ugly is where you trip up. The experiment in the article provided these women with all the beauty treatments known to man, regardless of cost. Cost, and time, are important factors. Not everyone makes enough to afford the beauty treatments and fashionable clothing needed to make them at least a 7 out of 10. 

Are you arguing that it's their fault if they are poor, or just middle class? 

Also, a lot of people are allergic to makeup -- I am. (And don't day there are hypoallergenic kind of makeup. That's more about marketing and much less about reality. And it's all expensive.) 

And flattering clothes are not cheap. Even if you can find them at thrift stores, it will take a long time. If you are raising children and working and perhaps caring for an elderly relative, you don't have time to comb through tons of items at Goodwill. 

It might be a person's choice to take care of dependents rather than doll themselves up. But it's hardly their ""fault"" for not being able to look good without reneging on their responsibilities to others. 

You're right that a large part of attractiveness is time and effort rather than genetics. But you are wrong to blame the people who don't have the time or money to make themselves attractive.",B,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more nuanced perspective on the original poster's argument, acknowledging that factors such as cost and time play a significant role in one's ability to make themselves more attractive. The reply also brings up valid points about the challenges that individuals may face in terms of affording beauty treatments, fashionable clothing, and taking the time to prioritize self-care over other responsibilities. Additionally, the mention of allergies to makeup and the limited availability of affordable, hypoallergenic options adds another layer to the argument. Overall, Reply B effectively challenges the original poster's viewpoint by highlighting the complexities and barriers that individuals may face in their pursuit of attractiveness."
predict-explain,"Most social progressives, love democracy, and so it is of relatively little surprise to me that as they have achieved a majority (in Reddit and the West), that they want to exercise their new-found power over reactionary groups.  I would offer, however, that at one point in time they were a minority, and with the advent of freedom of speech, their voices were allowed to shine in free, open, democratic discourse.  I find it very disturbing that people who claim to be supporting ""social progress"" in society want to begin delimiting and banning thinkers who already exist as a minority that rests outside the norm of consensual decency.  

You cannot use a principle of liberal social democracy, and then turn around and illiberally and antisocially try to close the door behind you.   This understanding that freedom of speech is ""good while it benefits us, but bad when it doesn't"" is exactly the reason why it must exist, and was the very mechanism that gave us social progress: to allow individuals or minority groups to challenge the group-think of the masses.

I'm sure that if you'd have one person who wants to turn a country into a USSR-style totalitarian communism, and another person who wants to turn a country into Nazism, they would both view their own ideas as ""progress"".

predict-explain,"New here, so please correct me if I am doing anything wrong.

Before I begin I want to point out that this is strictly opinionated and based off of personal observations. Also my grammar isn't the best so please forgive any errors.
 
The main issue I have with marriage is the consequences of ending it. I do understand that this can be avoided to a degree with prenuptial agreements however, they are generally frowned upon. The idea of penalizing someone for ending a failing relationship seems counterproductive to me. This creates a sense of security to those who have refrained from showing or disclosing certain habits or personality traits to their spouse. It also encourages many to ""let themselves go."" By that I mean things such as weight gain, poor hygiene, addictions, etc. 

Secondly, I have seen in many cases where there is just no repairing the relationship, yet the couple remains together due to the financial repercussions of ending their failed marriage. This ultimately leads to a very uncomfortable situation at home, especially for children. It also in many cases leads to infidelity which brings a plethora of problems itself.

All of that said, my opinion is probably a bit biased due to my now divorced parents' marriage, but I am open to hear other arguments on the issue.

Edit: First off, I'd like to thank everyone for their responses. I'd just like to clear up some things I didn't communicate well in my post.

1. By penalizing I wasn't just referring to spousal support and alimony but the legal fees as well.

2. The argument I made was not meant to necessarily knock the institution of marriage because I do think it can work but there does exist many problems with how a failed marriage is dealt with...at least here in the US. My issue is mainly with society's expectation that long term relationships must eventually lead to marriage when it is not for everyone.

Lastly, a few of you pointed out the issues that arise when one spouse stays at home with the children and the other wants out of the marriage down the line. I do now see more of a purpose for it when the intention is to start a family.","Marriages ending aren't attempting to penalize people, most of the typical ""downsides"" are actually benefits if you look at them in context. Yes, it sucks that you sometimes need to use the legal system to split your properties in half, but on the plus side, you have a system to ensure you can at least get half of the things the two of you owned as a couple. There are way's that this can be done without marriage at this point of course, but they still hold the same ""drawbacks"". another huge benefit is custody rights.

The argument of ""letting yourself go"" has nothing to do with actually getting married. it has to do with being around someone and not having feeling a strong pressure to find someone to be with. This happens with or without marriage, and its really down to the couple to handle that.

&gt; Secondly, I have seen in many cases where there is just no repairing the relationship, yet the couple remains together due to the financial repercussions of ending their failed marriage. This ultimately leads to a very uncomfortable situation at home, especially for children. It also in many cases leads to infidelity which brings a plethora of problems itself.

The big issue here is that the alternative is much worse. This is usually about the person who has a larger income feeling they deserve more of the assets after the divorce, and not wanting to give that up. Yes, it can really suck, but imagine if assets were not split? Especially if there are children involved, things can get very complicated. Imagine a situation with one stay at home parent, and one employed parent. The couple made this decision because it made sense at the time, but now they are unhappy and wish to divorce. The stay at home parent has very few technical skills from not being a part of the work force, is the primary caretaker of the child and would likely have custody, and if they were not entitled to any of the assets that the employed parent had, they would really have nothing, despite that they were operating and working as a team.

And yes, I am aware that legal fee's are quite high, and that's really the biggest issue. That being said, the legal protection is what makes a marriage a risk more safe. I would be less willing to share a bank account, and all of my possessions with another person if there was not any form of legal protection in place to help deal with that.","Sorry about your parents. That really sucks, and I hope you're able to maintain a healthy relationship with them both. 

About your CMV, I'm not sure I understand what you mean by ""penalizing someone for ending a failing relationship."" When two people divorce, generally the state divides their income &amp; assets in half, and every effort is made to ensure that neither party gets to walk away with everything and leave their spouse with bupkis. Basically the whole point of divorce law is to ensure a fair division of property. This includes alimony &amp; child support if one of the spouses has no ready way to make their own income.

The problem is that it's cheaper for two working adults to share a household, so when they have to go back to living in a single-income household, finances can get tight. There's nothing courts can do about this: it simply flat out costs more to maintain two houses than to maintain just one. I don't think this is a ""penalty"" for divorce so much as it means simply losing the financial benefit of being married (or civil union'd or what have you).",A,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a more thorough explanation of the benefits and reasons behind certain aspects of marriage and divorce, such as property division and custody rights.

The user in reply A presents a more nuanced and detailed argument, which may help the original poster better understand the complexities of marriage and divorce."
predict-explain,"I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually rich white kids that already have a socioenconomic advantage. I was a regular upper-middle class guy who went to public school. I loved it. My school was great. We went on fun field trips, and even a trip to Europe. Homeschooling your kid is just insurance that he/she will be socially awkward, and disadvantaged. Lots of homeschooling involves religious indoctrination, and very one-sided opinions. In public school you are exposed to many different views, opinions, and types of people. These problems would be solved if everyone had to go to public school. Everyone would have an equal education, and equal opportunity.

Everyone would have an equal education"".  There is huge disparity between public schools.  The top rival the finest private schools.  The bottom simply hope to keep the kids off the streets for a few hours per week.

* ""I have never seen any benefit to private school.""  Benefit for whom?  For the students who attend them, they can offer caliber teaching, smaller classes,  better facilities, a safer environment and a peer group with similar academic skills and aspirations.  You can question whether they are beneficial for society, but there's no question that they benefit their students.

* ""The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start.""  For the kids who are already rich, the inequality was already there.  Without the private  schools, they'd still be in the elite school districts with other rich white kids.  However, most private schools also have robust scholarship programs which allow promising low-income students to attend.  In many states, they wouldn't be allowed into the elite public school districts.  So, which one creates social inequality?

* ""Homeschooling your kid is just insurance that he/she will be socially awkward, and disadvantaged"".  True in some cases, but if you look at some of the truly shining stars, they have been home schooled.  If you are in the top .01% of students, the public schools simply can't meet your needs.

But beyond all of this, where do you decide that parents can't choose a different option than the one you personally think is the best one for them?  As a society we grant parents discretion in deciding what's best for their kids within reason.

Why would be ban activities that DO benefit their children?","Here's something I can attest to as a guy who spent a good bit of his younger years in a private school.
A lot of good teachers quit from the public schools due to red tape and excessive amounts of paperwork involved. These teachers, the ones of talked to (who are some of the best I've ever had) argue that they much prefer teaching where they have more freedom to be creative and instill real knowledge and fun activities, not run through a curriculum as quickly as possible to meet state standards. I worked an internship last year with a teacher at a smaller private school and he was able to have his students do debates, projects, plays, and art. He was able to make them love and respect him, and they all learned a lot-Even the at-risk kids. I can tell you it's a lot more effective than handing out a blue diamond book every week and teaching to the test. 

If that doesn't get you, here's another point-The public school near my house was massive and I was barely even a number to them. Private schools are much smaller and more personal. Don't you think a lot of at-risk kids would benefit from having their teacher know them as more than just a name on a list of grades with 500-1000 other names on it? They don't have as much opportunity to sit in the back of the class and get away with murder. It also helps foster discussion, as smaller class sizes are easier to work with than massive ones. 

Also, in regards to bullying. Oftentimes, draconian state laws basically prohibit anything resembling coherent thought on that topic. I'm sure if you've been on reddit as long as I have, you've heard plenty of ""No tolerance policy"" stories. I've met people in real life that have had that happen to them. It's not the least bit uncommon. Private schools are allowed to make their own rules and can handle bullying in a rational way (It also helps that you would probably personally know the administration official you go to for it, whereas that wouldn't be as common in a large public school).",B,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a more comprehensive and well-rounded argument, addressing various aspects of the original poster's points and offering counterarguments with examples. It also brings up the idea of parental choice and the benefits that private schools can offer to students. Reply B focuses more on personal experiences and anecdotes, which may not be as convincing to someone who is looking for a more analytical and evidence-based argument."
predict-explain,"If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available. On a nationwide scale, decreasing population means available work. Natural resources of food, water, fuel, and other materials are becoming scarcer everyday. On a global scale, less population means more available goods to all. What result(s) of an increasing population size could surpass these benefits? If we were hypothetically at the growth cap for the human population, would everybody still get frantic like when it's is brought up that the U.S. born citizen population is reproducing below replacement?

Edit: it seems a lot of the response pertain to economy. I suppose I was wrong in respect to a declining population being beneficial in this aspect. However, I still seem to feel that a shrinking population would benefit us as a species. Our survival, and that of our environment, would be better off with less people. But still, I'm open to changing my view.","Shrinking populations are actually really disruptive and dangerous things.  There are many reasons for this but it all basically boils down to less economic activity is bad.

First lets consider the direct effects.  Property prices would plunge.  If there are 100 houses and 100 families to fill them you need to build a new house to accommodate the 101st family.  The material supplies, land value, and profit margin set the cost of that house.  The value of the land is based on what the last piece of land in the area sold for.  This is a nice stable system and allows every one of the 100 families who already owns a house to have a house worth hundreds of thousands of dollars (as thats what a new house costs).  If however you have 99 families and 100 houses that 100th house is worthless.  No one wants it, so no one buys it, no one uses it, AND more importantly, if that house is worth $0.00 all of the other houses are worth $0.00 as well.  We instantly destroyed the entire community's home values.  Detroit has a shrinking population and you can buy houses there for less than a cheese burger.

Next the stock market.  Stock prices are based, to a large degree, on anticipated future growth of the companies.  Publicly traded companies tend to sell for 12X their annual earnings.  Privately traded companies tend to sell for 7X their annual earnings.  This is because of the difference in growth prospects.  With a declining population and thus declining business activity the stock market would take a huge hit wiping out huge amounts of savings (from people who already lost all the equity in their homes).

Next comes government debts.  Right now government services in all of the western world are financed by deficit spending.  Lenders lend money because they feel the country will be able to pay it back eventually.  If however the GDP starts to go down investors won't lend and governments will fall into the trap that snared Greece.

I could go on and on and on.  But population decline is really bad news.","I'm an evolutionary ecologist by profession and I can provide a little perspective here that may change your view.   
   
If you happen to be a person attempting to change OP's view that is.   
    
Population growth is one of those things that's pretty well understood. There are a few ways for populations to change in numbers and the most basic is exponential growth. That's how human population is changing.   
But, when that's how populations change, they will hit what OP called a 'growth cap'. We call this 'carrying capacity' and mathematically it's represented as K.   
           
What follows here will potentially get a little farther than necessary into  the ecology of the issue, but I think it's necessary to fully explain the situation our species faces in the next few hundred years.    

_________________    
     
        
Carrying capacity and population growth (r/K selection):     

Check out Fig. 5 in [this link](http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/an-introduction-to-population-growth-84225544)    
    
On that graph there is a place on the x-axis marked K.   
   
That graph is a line that represents how a population would grow under normal conditions. Meaning that it isn't growing exponentially, it's growing logistically.    
K is the carrying capacity of the habitat. It's the number of individuals of a species that can be supported by the habitat.   
   
K-selected animals would have a population around K. They have stable populations and relatively low mortality and will generally hover right around where they should be.     
     
They are called K-selected because they are selected for populations right around the carrying capacity.    
     
r-selected species are 'rate-selected'. So they are selected to be growing at a maximal rate. That's because they are usually something like mice that will have huge mortality, so the individuals are all pumping out as many offspring as possible.     
    
r-selected organisms will generally have a population right around K/2. That's because that's where the slope of that line is steepest, so that's where it's growing fastest.      
     
(Edit: To clarify, each species would have a different graph. So the mouse would have a different graph from the cat. The mouse population would be at K/2 for the mice, not K/2 for the cats.)
     
**Now check out Fig 8.**   
That's human population since the advent of agriculture. Notice it's not a logistic growth curve. Our population is growing exponentially. That's because we're K-selected, but we haven't reached K yet.     
When we reach K what's going to happen is that we'll exceed it. When a population is growing like ours it will exceed K, then there will be famine, disease, death, real apocalyptic shit. That will drop the population well below K. The population will then start to rebound and go towards K again. The it will exceed it again and fall again. But this time the rise above K will be smaller and when it falls again it won't fall as far below K. It will sort-of oscillate about K for a while then level out and hover around K.     
     
Problem with human population growth is that we are destroying all of the habitat that would define K. So we're not just exponentially going for K, we're also dragging K towards us. And in the end, when we reach K, we may well have lowered that bar far further than 7 billion.   
   
At least one well known researcher has predicted that our species will not last long enough for sea level rise to be any kind of issue. This person is in part responsible for wiping out small-pox and [he gives](http://phys.org/news/2010-06-humans-extinct-years-eminent-scientist.html) our species no more than 100 years until we are extinct.",A,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a detailed explanation of population growth and carrying capacity, using graphs and examples to illustrate the concept. It also discusses the potential consequences of exceeding carrying capacity, such as famine and disease. This response offers a scientific perspective on the issue and highlights the long-term implications of unchecked population growth. Reply A, on the other hand, focuses more on the immediate economic effects of a shrinking population. While these effects are valid, Reply B delves deeper into the ecological and evolutionary aspects of the issue, which may have a greater impact on changing the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"So I saw someone link to [this column](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/want-to-be-president-show-us-how-youd-handle-a-disaster/2015/07/30/00fa4d8e-315c-11e5-97ae-30a30cca95d7_story.html) and thought it was really clever.

I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates.  If you want hard questioning, or to know their stand on the issues, interviews from journalists can do that.  Debates are just grandstanding and ""gotchas.""  

A crisis simulation on the other hand would be really useful for getting information about how candidates would do the job of President.  We would see how they asses a situation, how they handle disagreeing advisors, and how deep their knowledge of government runs.

This is also a technique used in a lot of other situations to train and evaluate people who will hold a lot of responsibility.  If you want to be an astronaut, you're going to be doing a lot of simulations.

As far as getting candidates to do it, I could see this being something that a somewhat more obscure candidate does as a way to generate publicity, and which might catch on.   Probably not for the major party candidates for this election cycle, but maybe in the future.

The likelihood of a serious crisis happening is low.

Instead, I propose a political simulator. Even a game like ""Democracy"" would work. It would show what kind of policies the candidate would implement, balancing the budget, how they would react to certain political situations that arise, and if they would focus more on getting re-elected or doing the right thing.","Crisis simulations for astronauts or pilots involve re-enacting situations where methodical, definitive actions solve the simulated problems. However, a crisis simulation for a politician or presidential candidate would be far more difficult to carry out. It would involve social situations where an action could have a very wide variety of outcomes, based on subtle and complicated factors that a simulation could never truly mimic.

 I'd imagine that a candidate simulation would be like playing a text based game, where every decision leads to consequences which arguably would not have happened in a real life situation. Hence, there would probably be loads of arguments about whether the simulation were realistic or not.

Edit: shortened a sentence",B,A,"I would say Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A offers a practical alternative to crisis simulations by suggesting a political simulator like the game ""Democracy."" This suggestion addresses the original poster's idea of using simulations to evaluate candidates' policies and decision-making abilities, but in a more feasible and controlled manner. Additionally, Reply A provides specific examples of what a political simulator could entail, making it more convincing and actionable. On the other hand, Reply B raises valid concerns about the limitations of crisis simulations for politicians, but it doesn't offer a concrete alternative solution like Reply A does."
predict-explain,"**Edit:** I've been fairly convinced it's not sexist. Still maintain invasive as all heck. Carry on, thanks for getting passionate about it!

**Edit 2:** 7 hours and only a few personal insults later... I've heard a lot of great things I agree with but I still feel it's invasive by nature to ask that much of submitters to a general gw subreddit. 

**Final Edit:** [It's been done.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3djk9x/cmv_its_both_invasive_and_sexist_for/ct6796p) I still think it's an invasive thing to ask of someone sharing their nude body but I'm glad a community member could shed light on the creation of the subreddit. 

---

Browsing naked bodies casually when I noticed that over at /r/ladybonersgw they require at least half of a guys face to be shown with every submission. Here's the rule with the line that made me go 'wait, that doesn't make any sense...' in bold.

&gt;  All posts must contain at least half your face. We must clearly be able to see some of your features! I.e. mouth and nose/eyes and nose. If this minimum requirement is not met, a face picture must be posted in the comments. **This means that we DO NOT allow text-only posts.** All posts must contain at least one image which fulfils rule two.

It looks like it's enforced very often.

Reasons I think this is shocking and inappropriate:

* Sharing yourself nude on the internet is super taboo and the vast majority of people who do, for safety and privacy, would never show part or all of their face.

* It seems like a really silly and irrelevant way to accomplish no text posts. 

* If this was a rule on a female gonewild, I feel like there'd be some sort of outrage at the invasiveness. Kinda like 'I'm sharing how much of myself, now everyone feels entitled to my face too?'

* As someone who wants to start enjoying the posts, it limits who is going to be posting which is disappointing. 

* If the point was to avoid 'floating dicks' everywhere, which makes more sense than the reasoning they give, then the amount of body shown should be the requirement. 

I don't think anyone should have to compromise their identity or do something many would be really uncomfortable with to be allowed to post on a subreddit. What am I missing that this rule is embraced?


*Disclaimer: Not an angry submitter or anything. I want to enjoy an overflowing of peen.*

The reason being that every submission in ladybonersgw (and indeed every subreddit), is just that, a submission. Men are presenting pictures of themselves because they are getting something out of the experience. No one can be required to show their face on the internet,  they can be required to show their face to meet the criteria of the subreddit *if they want to submit to it*.

I'm going to use an exaggerated example to demonstrate the idea. Say we have a subreddit called r/sexyelbowsgw that is a community for hot young ladies to post pictures of their bare elbows. A requirement for submissions to that subreddit would probably include that at least one elbow be visible. This would likely not be challenged by anyone, because obviously, that's what that subreddit is for. People who like seeing elbows, and people interested in posting the sort of pictures that include elbows. The subreddit exists for people who want to see pics that meet that criteria, and those who are uncomfortable sharing their naked elbows with us would surely not post there. No one is requiring, or even asking them to, it's just that the sub exists for the kinds of pics that involve elbows.

Ladybonersgw isn't any different, it's just a community for people who like or want to post sexy pictures of men that include faces, instead of elbows.","&gt;  CMV: It's both invasive and sexist for /r/ladybonersgw to require submitters post their face


Your assumption is that someone who was going to post on /r/ladybonersgw without a face was then coerced into posting while showing a face.  

Let's consider the alternative.  What if only the men who are comfortable sharing their face share and everyone else is filtered out?  Those people then go elsewhere if they need to share their body.  In what way would that be invasive or sexist?

Also, I think it comes down to supply and demand.  In every dating site, I have heard female friends say that they receive pictures of guy's dicks.  Disembodied dicks have flooded the market and they are just not very much of an offering for a subreddit.  In contrast, women don't send pictures of themselves as often.  So /r/gonewild can be alluring without having the same demands.  

Yes, the sexes are treated differently, but I don't see how it is sexist.  The difference in treatment comes as a response from a contextual behavior, not as an oppression.",B,A,"I would say that reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a clear explanation of why the rule exists on r/ladybonersgw and compares it to a hypothetical scenario with a similar rule on a different subreddit. The user argues that the requirement for a face photo is not invasive or sexist because it is a criteria specific to that particular subreddit, similar to how a subreddit about elbows would require photos of elbows. This argument helps to contextualize the rule and show that it is not meant to be invasive or sexist, but rather a specific requirement for the type of content the subreddit is meant to showcase.

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the practical reasons for the rule and how it helps to filter out submissions from individuals who are not comfortable showing their face. While this is a valid point, it does not address the original poster's concerns about invasiveness and sexism in the same depth as reply A. Additionally, reply B's argument about supply and demand and the differences in behavior between men and women may not directly address the original poster's concerns about the rule being invasive or sexist. 

Overall, reply A provides a more thorough and contextualized argument that is likely to be more persuasive in changing the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"First I'm not a prude and I'm completely fine with nudity. I honestly wouldn't care if they abolished all public decency laws and everyone walked around naked. However, that doesn't change the fact that the laws exist, and are the basis of my argument. For the people who do get uncomfortable around nude breasts, a single father with his adolescent daughter, or a mother with a teenage son, or even some old stick in the mud curmudgeon, I don't think it's too much to ask to handle such things in private. Whether pumping milk, or nursing at home, there are ways of handling these things. No one else is obligated to accommodate 
public nudity. If it's not ""convenient"" for them, that's all part of the sacrifice of parenthood.

You say you're basing your view on the law, but [""Twenty-nine states exempt breastfeeding from public indecency laws.""](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/breastfeeding-state-laws.aspx) So in over 50% of the US, breast feeding is *not* considered ""indecent exposure."" 

Does your CMV only apply to the 21 states that don't have the exemption? Even in those states: ""Forty-nine states have laws that specifically allow women to breastfeed in any public or private location."" So really if you're saying ""I don't believe this is indecent but there are laws against indecent exposure so breastfeeding should be banned along with anything else in those laws"" that doesn't apply because the laws specifically exempt breast feeding from them and breast feeding in public is specifically allowed in all but one state.","Let's take the first part of the California Indecent exposure law:

&gt;Every person who willfully and lewdly, either:


&gt;    1. Exposes his person, or the private parts thereof, in any
public place, or in any place where there are present other persons
to be offended or annoyed thereby; or,

Pay careful attention to the first sentence, because it's the most important. Breastfeeding is not typically done ""lewdly"". Basically every indecent exposure law has this kind of requirement.

A woman that ""breastfed"" in the manner of a striptease in public might well be violating indecent exposure laws. Doing so normally is not, because it's not lewd.",B,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a specific example of how breastfeeding does not typically meet the criteria for indecent exposure laws, as it is not done lewdly. By breaking down the language of the law and showing how breastfeeding does not align with the intent of the law, reply B effectively challenges the original poster's argument that breastfeeding in public should be banned based on public decency laws. This logical and detailed explanation is more likely to make the original poster reconsider their stance."
predict-explain,"Estimates show that the average american uses around 4 times the resources that the planet could support, if everyone was an American.

predict-explain,"First of all, I want to first express how happy I am with this subreddit. It has always been a hub for civilized discussion on complicated and difficult topics. I have never witnessed uncivilized discussion on here before and I'm glad to be a part of the community. Good job, Reddit!

With that said, if you are unfamiliar with the sexual revolution I am referring to, this is a time beginning in the 1960s where people experienced an ""urge to 'find oneself'"" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution)). During this time, lots of previously taboo'd sexually related acts, ideals, etc entered into society and have more recently, at the end of the 20th century have thoroughly integrated themselves into it. This involves a large variety of things including but not limited to: proliferation and normalization of pornography, sex before marriage, acceptance of sexually explicit movie/television material, contraceptions, and the LGBT movement.

For example, pornography, which was formerly unheard of in public conversation is now often not only discussed, but glorified and upheld as a great thing. This is just one example of what I am talking about. *I am not arguing the moralities of pornography however.*

**My argument: **The recent decision by the Supreme Court to rule in favor of gay marriage is simply the next step in the sexual revolution and essentially negates some of the arguments against the next step after this; I am specifically referring to  incestuous relationships, and other ways of ""loving"" someone. However, I will mainly refer to incest for the sake of a shorter discussion.

* One of the main arguments against gay marriage is that it is ""unnatural"". One could also argue that incest is unnatural, but even more broadly, any sexual relationship outside of marriage between a man and woman can be argued effectively as unnatural.

* Gay marriage activists very frequently champion progressive thinking and non-discrimination as basis for legalizing gay marriage. The term progressive is very open for interpretation, but eliminating discrimination is very straight forward. If someone named Cercei loves her brother named Jamie, should it be allowed? Should they be allowed to marry and procreate? Incestuous relationships very often breed deformities and retardations in children; should these children be forced to have an incomplete, handicapped life on the basis of equality. *For more information on incest please view this very informative [documentary](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068473/).*

* Another argument against gay marriage has frequently been that it further inhibits the ability for the human race to procreate. This is fairly obvious as to why people say this: a man and a man cannot bear a child and vice versa. However, the same argument stands for incest; in fact, it is worse. Incestuous relationships don't further the human species, but rather they turn it backwards by corrupting genes and eliminating diversity. Also, as previously stated, incest often results in retardation in the resulting child.

With gay marriage legalized officially, these arguments become unsubstantial and hypocritical to argue with against incest.

**In conclusion, my fear is that the sexual revolution has the potential to continue to progress and eventually today's taboos will become everyday occurrences all on the basis of equality and non-discrimination.** This has the potential to effect humans on not only a genetic level by potentially allowing incest to corrupt human genetic material and cause genetic disorders, but also on a societal level where humans become more concerned with catering to someones sexual identity/preference rather than the actual person inside. I believe this could be devastating to humans. I don't claim to know what would happen, but it isn't too difficult to come up with a worst-case scenario of what society could become when the main focus of peoples interactions is politically correctness, being non-offensive, and catering to every form of person on a sexual basis.

Please feel free to ask questions and I will be happy to clarify.

CMV,
Tresky

*Disclaimer: I am in no way attempting to say that gay marriage in and of itself is causing the downfall of humanity and am not attempting to demonize or put-down members of the LGBT community. I am merely making a case of a path that humanity could potentially be (and I now believe is) on that leads to a corrupt and evil society.*

Gay people are already freely and openly having sex in Western society; that ship has sailed long ago. America finally allowing gay couples to get married doesn't really change that. Along those lines, whether a gay couple is officially married doesn't change whether they can bear a child in the traditional manner. Marriage is pretty irrelevant to your concerns.

One of the worries you list is that society will become inordinately focused on catering to every form of sexuality. But actually, accepting that homosexuality is not a big boogey-man means we can stop putting so much focus on it. Instead we can all go on with our lives. That's the opposite of having this inordinate focus on the issue.

&gt; any sexual relationship outside of marriage between a man and woman can be argued effectively as unnatural.

You're talking specifically about the laws and legal decisions of one specific court in one specific country in one tiny moment in history. Nature, and specifically human nature, existed long before the supreme court did, or before the concept of legal state-sponsored marriage. So did homosexuality.","&gt;One of the main arguments against gay marriage is that it is ""unnatural"". One could also argue that incest and pedophilia are unnatural, but even more broadly, any sexual relationship outside of marriage between a man and woman can be argued effectively as unnatural.

Marriage is unnatural, humans present both monogamous and polygamous behaviour, marriage is outrageous and against nature.

&gt;Gay marriage activists very frequently champion progressive thinking and non-discrimination as basis for legalizing gay marriage. The term progressive is very open for interpretation, but eliminating discrimination is very straight forward. If someone named Cercei loves her brother named Jamie, should it be allowed? Should they be allowed to marry and procreate? Incestuous relationships very often breed deformities and retardations in children; should these children be forced to have an incomplete, handicapped life on the basis of equality.

Nope if they want to love each other or have sex that's fine, but having children should be illegal in some way.

&gt;Should pedophilia be legalized on the basis of ""eliminating discrimination""

Pedophilia is almost indistinguishable from child abuse, and thus no, homosexuality is, just like heterosexuality, pretty darn distinguishable from rape, and thus they're both ok.

&gt;Another argument against gay marriage has frequently been that it further inhibits the ability for the human race to procreate. This is fairly obvious as to why people say this: a man and a man cannot bear a child and vice versa. However, the same argument stands for incest; in fact, it is worse. Incestuous relationships don't further the human species, but rather they turn it backwards by corrupting genes and eliminating diversity. Also, as previously stated, incest often results in retardation in the resulting child.

Having children via incest should be illegal, homosexuality is a thing, and preventing gay people from marrying isn't going to make them straight all of a sudden, and one way of the other, the world is insanely overpopulated, and thus the less people that are born the better, the world would become a great place if suddenly everyone became homosexual, since natality would fall into nothingness and population would readjust somewhere reasonable.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A addresses the original poster's concerns by pointing out that legalizing gay marriage doesn't necessarily lead to a focus on every form of sexuality. It also highlights that human nature existed long before the concept of legal marriage, so arguments about what is ""natural"" in terms of relationships are subjective. Additionally, Reply A provides a more reasoned and logical response to the original poster's arguments, rather than resorting to extreme comparisons like Reply B does with pedophilia. 

Overall, Reply A provides a more coherent and rational argument that challenges the original poster's views in a respectful and logical manner."
predict-explain,"I have had friendships with various males, and only one of them has not tried to at one point in time, make it sexual. This was not a big deal when I wasn't in a relationship and I would just turn them down. Once I was, they all tried much harder than usual to pursue something whereas before it was a more passive attempt. Once they realized I was ""off the table"" of sorts and was serious about my now boyfriend, the relationship just dwindled despite my continuing to talk to them just as much as before. I realized this was because the conversation would always be very short due to me not replying to flirtatious texts which probably got really boring for them. 

What I mean by men and women cannot be just friends is that one or the other (possibly both), even if not having a physical relationship, is using each other for the ego boost that comes with someone of the opposite sex giving you attention and would under other circumstances, definitely hook up (or maybe at one point in time already have).  I also noticed even women who have a lot of male friends they spent a lot of time with and ""friend zoned"" them, they would still get weird and upset if the man was in a romantic relationship and therefore had less time to expend for her because it was going to his SO. This doesn't happen with their male friends as long as they see them enough because the male friends aren't using their male friends to feel attractive.. but suddenly ""just"" female friends tend to get very territorial once they aren't getting the attention from the male friend that they were used to or able to get that constant validation. 

Of course there will ALWAYS be exceptions. But I think, on average, this all proves to be true. This is also why I am pretty uncomfortable with my boyfriend having female friends that aren't also people I've met and felt comfortable with. He can, of course, but it makes me feel uncomfortable. The one he introduced me to automatically displayed the classic signs of using him for attention and being very touchy but pretending it's simply a ""brother"" like relationship. I would like to be comfortable with such friendships but it seems unnecessary to me within a relationship. In a group setting is fine, of course, as long as everyone is comfortable (which doesn't seem to happen if the friend has been in the persons life longer than the SO) but I am talking about opposite sex friendships when one or both parties are in a relationship with other people...I feel they have no reason to spend a lot of time interacting or spending time together one-on-one unless they are both lying to each other (or one person is) and hoping that something will happen (sexually or otherwise) without admitting it to themselves or like the [in my opinion] inappropriate feeling of playing with fire. 

I hold myself to the same standard, of course. My one male friend that has not tried anything was also my roommate but I always included my boyfriend and introduced them, and they became friends even. We would hang out alone sometimes but in public (during daytime) or just while one or the other is in the kitchen cooking. I don't think anything would happen if we did drink alone, as we have before I was dating my boyfriend, but I would respect my relationship enough that I'm not really interested in doing that anyway. I also have zero sexual attraction for him and imagine this is the same with him, towards me. This is ONE of those exceptions out of the plenty of male friends who out of nowhere have tried to hook up or tell me they have feelings for me and I suspect is not the average dynamic of a male-female friendship. So while I think it MAY be possible, it is somewhat rare. 

Obviously my view also applies to those who are strictly in monogamous relationships.

Tl;dr: 
Most men who have female ""platonic"" friends would sleep with them if the opportunity arose and if are in a relationship, only keep them around in case and because of the ego boost of being around women who aren't unattractive (to feel wanted). Most women who have male ""platonic"" friends are using them for the attention they get by feeling a man likes them, and can't have them to feel like a sought-after, high quality woman...and also get jealous when they begin dating a woman despite their ""just friend"" claims. always exceptions, but believe this to be generally true.","My initial reaction to this was outright confusion, as both I, my wife, and most people I know have friends of the opposite gender and those relationships do not fit the conditions you've posited. However, simply saying that doesn't warrant much of an argument, does it? 

Then again, *your* conviction is based on exactly that same thing. Quite simply, you're taking your own limited, personal experience and using it to reach a conclusion about the rest of the world. Anecdote  shouldn't be much basis for such sweeping conclusions, but unfortunately, that's how most people tend to think.

So, if your conviction on this subject comes from the experience of one person, does my own experience, as one person, negate that? If we're being logical, it should. I suppose you could say that I am lying, or that I'm simply too naive to see that my relationships truly *do* fit into your characterization. However, those issues of veracity are frankly the only things that could logically diminish my account in the overall formulation of your conclusions here.

Furthermore, you've already admitted to having had a purely platonic male friend in the past. So, you know it is a possibility. However, you dismiss this as being an anomaly. Actually, after telling a story in which you confirm that these relationships *are* possible, you then immediately start to deny its  significance by saying, ""I think it MAY be possible"". Why, after you've already shown with an example that it in fact *is* possible, do you immediately introduce doubt by saying that it ""may"" be possible? Surely, you've already confirmed that it *is* possible. 

So, now your only remaining issue is one of frequency. From your own experience, the vast majority of these relationships don't work. In this thread, you have many people telling you from *their* own experience that many actually do. So, perhaps your issues of frequency are more unique to you than you think. 

Let's look at your anomaly: You wrote, "" I always included my boyfriend and introduced them, and they became friends even...""
 
About the possibility of hooking up you wrote, ""but I would respect my relationship enough that I'm not really interested in doing that anyway"".

So, if we demonstrate mutual trust by introducing our significant others to our different-gendered friends, and we respect our significant others enough to ensure we would never do something to  hurt them, it seems to help. It's at least a very good start, right?

You also wrote, ""I also have zero sexual attraction for him and imagine this is the same with him, towards me.

I'd say that certainly helps as well! I'm assuming there are plenty of  men in the world that you do not find sexually attractive, but also like their personalities. I'm also assuming that there are plenty of men out there who would feel the same about you. And, contrary to popular belief, even if you are a very attractive woman, not every man on earth is going to want to sleep with you. That being said, while a lack of sexual attraction helps, I don't think it's necessary at all. I think what is most necessary is trust and respect. 

The bottom line is, you know it can work. You can even point to specific things that seem to make it work. Those specific things you pointed to really aren't anomalous! It sounds like your experience has been limited and you are not forming the right kinds of male-female relationships. 

I'd like to add this as a more in-depth counter-anecdote: 

I have a few attractive female friends that are not my wife. They are intelligent, kind, interesting, and fun people who *happen* to be good-looking women. They are simply people who I enjoy spending time with. In a couple of instances, they are people that my wife has introduced me to. Friends of her own, who I've grown close to. My wife works crazy hours, and I've gone out with them alone for meals, movies, concerts, etc. I have felt none of these characteristics you are talking about. It's not an ego boost, and I have no ""just in case"" thinking. That last part was the most bizarre to me. The idea of losing my wife is far too devastating to start considering ""backup plans"". In terms of the ego boost, I'm not sure what you mean exactly. I mean, I'm certain that my female friends aren't hanging out with me because I look like Brad Pritt...primarily because I don't. And I'm not walking around with my chest puffed because of the ""hot chick"" that's by my side. We are hanging out because we think one another's an interesting, fun enough person to hang out with. That may give an ego boost, but just as much as a same-gendered friend would. We're being validated as people. Another human enjoys our company. Of course it feels nice. It needn't be about sex!

Anyways, I hope that with all the responses in this thread, at least someone will change your mind. Because, if not, you'll be losing nearly 50% of the population from your pool of potential friends! Friends are wonderful things, and they're not terribly easy to make and keep. Don't limit the possibilities.","If I understand you correctly, your view is that with a few exceptions, men always want sex from women and that women always want attention from men, and that while they can be friends, that friendship is incompatible with a relationship that either of the friends may be in.

It seems that your view is based solely in your own experiences, which in itself is not a bad thing, I think most people form their views in a similar fashion. The issue I have with this case is that, after having read responses to your view, and your responses to them, you don't seem willing to accept that anyone else's reasoning is as sound as your past experiences. Whenever someone makes an argument that your view is flawed, you respond with an exception, the issue is always that they have misunderstood you, not that you don't agree with their logic.

I have two points to make about this, the first is that it doesn't appear, to me, that you are willing to have your view changed. I think that you are certain that your experiences are characteristic of any interaction between any man and any woman. Which leads me to my second point, perhaps the relationships you base your view upon are flawed. If all of your male friends only want to sleep with you and have no other motives for being your friend then that  specific relationship is what is wrong, not every relationship between two platonic friends.

I'd like to add that I haven't meant any of this to be condescending to you, but in my experience, addressing the reason that I don't think opposing views are able to penetrate someone's beliefs is an effective way of moving a discussion forward in a meaningful manner.",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"1. Military industry keeps some of the very few manufacturing jobs in US, this industry's survival critically depends on US's defence policies and government orders, without US spending sizeable chunk of its budget on military, millions of jobs will be lost.

2. US has the money. Yes, US is in some serious debt right now, however USD is the most indestructible currency ever existed in human history, with US's economy size, gold reserve and military power at its back, it is impossible for USD to collapse in the foreseeable future. US can always borrow more money from its own citizen or foreign countries without worrying about crisis like Greece happen. Further more, even if USD value drops as a consequence of US printing more cash to pay back debts, all other countries will follow to de-value their currencies to compete with US, just like we have seen in the past few years.

3. US spending more on military doesn't necessary mean a safer world, but at least it will make its NATO allies safer. As a Canadian I know we don't have to worry about fighting off an invasion alone. US spending more on defence means we will spend less, this will benefit our economy and allow us to put more money into our welfare system.
 
4. No matter how much US government sets its 'defence' budget,  US's armed force is built to be an offence force. Considering how the military complex works and US politician/public thinks, US will never stop bombing/invading smaller countries to defend its 'freedom'. Spending more money developing and ensuring US's technological advantage on military means less casualties from those inevitable wars.

5. Military technologies benefits civilian life in the long run. We wouldn't get internet, GPS, jumble jets and spacecraft if US haven't thrown so much money into military. I want to see human land on Mars before I am 50, so come on US congress, make it happen!

Edit:

To answer some of the most frequent questions:

**Why not spend the money on infrastructure/medical research/education/NASA?**

Well, when US was cutting military spending in the 90s, the federal spending on education/infrastructure/NASA/higher education research also went down. I fundamentally disagree the argument that 'we are not spending enough on such/such/such because we spend too much on military!' The fact is the amount we spend on military and other programs is not a zero sum game. Spending less on military dose not bring US better infrastructure/education/research. 

**US is already spending too much on military, it's by far the most powerful force in the world, why more?**

In % per GDP sense, US ranked No.21 in the world(3.5%), behind Saudi Arabia (10.8%), Israel (5.2%) and Russia (4.5%), this is not that much. Comparing to those countries and the collapsed USSR, US is in a much better financial state (see my point 2).

Also, US government and public have set their military force to be the keeper of freedom/world police ever since the end of WWII. Yes the current size of US military is too big for a defensive force. However, for what US public and government want it to be? I think the current spending is well justified if not insufficient.","So I feel like this is a joke but I can't really tell. Here goes

First, pretty much everything you're saying cal already be accomplished by maintaining our extremely high military funding. Here's a point by point response:

1. Sure, but it also creates the military industrial complex. It  creates an incentive to go to war because it's profitable. Killing your own people and other people because you can make money is kinda a bad thing. The US can create jobs plenty of other ways: build infrastructure, invest in green energy, etc. and all of those are pretty harm-free

2. Okay? But we already have a [noticeably stronger military](http://pgpf.org/Chart-Archive/0053_defense-comparison) than anyone else. Just because we *can* spend the money doesn't mean we *should* when it can be spent on [much better things](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21605932-country-where-everyone-drives-america-has-shoddy-roads-bridging-gap)

3. No, it means we go to war more. Which means we draw NATO allies into war. And we already have a military strong enough to protect our allies. Who in NATO is under any sort of threat right now?

4. How about we just don't go to war in those cases? Increased spending at least makes it more likely that we go to useless wars

5. So fund research, not military research.","You have some arguments for why the US should spend more money in general, and other ones why spending on the military is better.  

1. I think there better ways to support manufacturing jobs than just military spending.  Instead of building a 12th aircraft carrier, the US could spend that money manufacturing more buses or trains to improve US infrastructure.  This also could improve the economy and the quality of life of many Americans by making transportation better and easier.

2. This is an argument for spending money in general, not necessarily on military spending.  The US is concerned about long term debt, and is actively cutting funding from plenty of other programs.  To some extent, there is a limit to what is spent total by the government, and so more military spending inevitably will mean less spending on other programs.  

3. Most Americans will not be terribly motivated to think that their additional military spending will lead to Canadians having richer social programs, especially if it comes with cuts to American social programs.  Additionally, the US military is already overwhelming strong, and more or less spending probably wouldn't impact strength in any meaningful way.  The US spends approximately as much on its military as the rest of the world.  Most of the other top spending countries are allies of the US.  
4. There are ways to continue high R&amp;D budgets in the military without spending as much.  About $300 billion/~$700 billion of the annually spent military budget is on pay and benefits for soldiers. That means that the US Militiary will spend more in wages and benefits in 2015 than the Canadian government will spend **in total** in 2015.  One of the big reasons for this is that the US military has hundred of thousands of soldiers stationed overseas, including about 60,000 in Germany and 30,000 in Japan, where troops have been stationed since the end of WWII.  
5. The military isn't the only program the US can spend money on.  They can support NASA, scientific grants, etc, many of which would provide a much better bang for the buck in terms of scientific achievement.",A,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides specific examples and alternative solutions to the points made by the original poster, showing that there are better ways to achieve the same goals without increasing military spending. It also addresses the potential negative consequences of increased military spending, such as cuts to other important programs and the impact on social programs in the US. Additionally, Reply B highlights the excessive spending on military personnel and the potential for reallocating those funds to more productive areas. Overall, Reply B presents a more well-rounded and thoughtful argument that challenges the original poster's views effectively."
predict-explain,"I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately.  I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural.  If after death we experience what we experienced before birth which is nothingness, then isnt life meaningless?  Why should we continue to suffer when life is literally a constant suffering?  I personally believe life is meaningless.  When you are under the assumption that you experience nothingness when you are dead, what is the point of living?  
The only reason I can personally see for living is to not inflict additional emotional suffering on those that you know and care about you.  But if you do experience nothingness after life then why should it matter when you wont be able to conceive of this suffering.
Its been something I've been thinking a lot about lately... Change my view, please.
Also, this is not a cry for help and I will not be jumping off the golden gate bridge any time soon.","Life is not constant suffering. Not at all. It is filled with joy and fulfillment. Some suffer more than others. But I don't think hardly anyone has lived a life of pure suffering. Everyone finds joy in something. 

So why go on living even if it is meaningless? Because it is fun. I mean why not go on? Think of all the stuff you can experience and enjoy. If it doesn't matter whether you live or die you might as well live and make the most of it.","There is no inherent meaning in life so it is up to us to make meaning. This is not a choice, but central to who we are as sentient beings. In reality there is no singular you that persists through time. You are the result of many processes interacting and constantly changing and evolving. The string that ties all of this together into an identity is the life story that you tell yourself. We are quite literally nothing without this narrative, so you could say that while life has no inherent meaning, the experience of living is utterly dependent on creating meaning.",B,A,"I would say Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B delves deeper into the concept of creating meaning in life and emphasizes the importance of the narrative we tell ourselves. By highlighting that life has no inherent meaning but is dependent on the meaning we create, it provides a different perspective that may encourage the original poster to reconsider their belief that life is meaningless. Reply A, on the other hand, focuses more on the enjoyment and experiences that life can offer, which may not address the original poster's existential concerns as directly."
predict-explain,"I've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the support for the lady. 

The jury found McDonald's to be 80% responsible and awarded several million dollars compensation, which was later reduced to about 600 000 dollars, and then later settled.

Acording to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants) and another [website](http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm) here are the abridged facts of the incident as I understand them.

* coffee was ordered at a drive through window
* coffee was handed to Liebeck
* Liebeck's son drove off
* they stopped so Liebeck could add sugar
* Liebeck spilled the entire cup over her lap, hence severely injuring her

My argument that it is not McDonald's responsibility is that she had been safely handed the coffee. The transaction was complete and she had control. If the coffee had been spilled during the handover I would view it the other way around.

There are two arguments that I reject. I reject that the severity of the injury affects the responsibility. Comments such as ""have you seen those injuries, they're horrific, she had to be reconstructed"" are common. This is true, they were appalling injuries. But I think this is a strawman argument because my point is that it was not McDonald's responsibility after the handover, not that the injuries were minor. 

I reject that the coffee was too hot. These are hot drinks. It's obvious to me, and I would hope anyone who intends to drink such a drink that it would be hot and care should be given. Perhaps my culture views it differently. I grew up in England, and here 9 and ten year olds make tea for themselves; kettles boil water and then that water is poured into a teapot / cup. We know from a young age that this is dangerous and extreme care must be taken when handling such hot water. Indeed, in a similar UK case against McDonald's regarding hot coffee, the judge ruled that McDonald's was not responsible, one of the reasons being that people expect hot drinks to be hot and should make reasonable safety measures themselves. I do not believe Americans don't realise hot water is dangerous.

 If anyone would like to comment, I'd be happy to elaborate further. I look forward to having interesting discussion.

**EDIT:** *Thank you for your replies so far, I'm working my way through replying to them.*

**EDIT:** *Thank you for your comments and discussion. I have awarded deltas to comments that highlighted arguments that I had not considered. My view is still that McDonald's were not liable for any costs. I have come to the conclusion that the discrepancy is due to a difference in cultural expectations of temperature of served hot drinks. I was brought up in a culture where water is regularly boiled at home and hence all children learn how to be careful around just-boiled water. As mentioned above, that is part of the reason why an almost identical case was thrown out in the UK.*

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","As I see it, you're arguing from the wrong stand point. 

Your view is mostly based around the notion that customers should expect a hot drink to be hot, and therefore handle it carefully. This is logical and thus at a first glance seems like an argument in the context of this lawsuit.

However, it is irrelevant because it is not mutually exclusive with the notion of serving (easily tippable, might I add) hot drinks that will not cause severe (3rd degree) burns in the event of the cup tipping over. Something we can very easily observe when you look at just about any other establishment that sells coffee.

The loose thread in your reasoning is as follows: should customers handle hot drinks carefully? Yes. However, should establishments sell hot drinks in handheld, plastic cups that will cause you 3rd degree burns if spilled? No. And the thing is that there is a very extensive middle ground in here, to which all establishments selling this sort of items adhere to.

For this reason, McDonald's was found liable.","I think the important thing here is *why* she won the suit.    
   
The jury never found that McDonald's was entirely responsible.   
The award was given to the plaintiff based on the principle of 'Comparative Negligence'. This principle isn't applied in all jurisdictions, but it *is* used in the jurisdiction wherein the incident and the lawsuit took place.   
According to this doctrine the plaintiff can be awarded damages even if they themselves contributed to the damage.    
    
So taking all of the evidence that McDonald's was *to some extent* responsible, they were also to some extent liable.    
   
Given the over-heated coffee they carried some liability; but I think more importantly they intentionally down-played the warning on the coffee cup. That was probably done to make the cup more aesthetically pleasing, but it nonetheless seats them with some responsibility.   
They took their own warning to their customers and made it negligible so that the cup would be attractive.    
   
I don't think it can be argued that McDonald's carried zero responsibility for the incident and the law in that state makes it clear that they are therefore liable *to some extent*.",B,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A effectively addresses the original poster's argument about customers needing to handle hot drinks carefully by pointing out that it is not mutually exclusive with the responsibility of establishments to sell hot drinks in safe containers. The argument that McDonald's should have taken precautions to prevent severe burns in the event of a spill is a strong one and addresses the core issue of liability in this case. It also provides a clear middle ground that other establishments adhere to, highlighting that McDonald's was negligent in their handling of the situation. 

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the legal principle of Comparative Negligence and the downplayed warning on the coffee cup, which may not directly address the original poster's argument about personal responsibility and cultural expectations. While it does provide additional context and legal reasoning for the case, it may not be as effective in changing the original poster's view on McDonald's liability in this specific situation."
predict-explain,"I'm not sure at what point people stopped thinking about the ramifications of their actions and became so head strong that they believed they were invincible, that officers judgements were infallible, that their rights would keep the blood inside their body.

I have practiced civil disobedience in my life.  I have been arrested more than once.  But I'll tell you one thing, I have never failed to comply with an officers orders.

I nearly ever incident of a person involved in a police shooting, they have one problem.  They are not being compliant.  The United States offers you rights, but your rights can't keep you alive.  This often turns into a matter of ""you're victim blaming.""  I'm simply saying that right or wrong, the behavior of these victims can most often be described as ""exercising outrageously poor judgement."" 

For one simple reason, I value my life. It's not a matter of principle, it's a matter of practicality.  I don't want to die. And I don't feel sorry for anyone whose ego is bigger than their brain, whether or not their shooting was justified.  

CMV","People aren't ""so headstrong that they feel they are invincible,"" they just believe they live in a country in which there is a Bill of Rights guaranteeing they won't be executed for rudeness.  

You, I and everyone else in this country have the right to be rude to cops, be angry with cops, to insult cops.  White soccer moms avail themselves of this right every day in the USA without being shot in the side of the head.

You don't generally have the right not to comply with the police orders, but you *do* have the right to have your non-compliance charged and brought before a judge before you are punished, and you *do* have the right to have that punishment be within the range provided for by statute.

Here's *exactly* what you're saying: I am totally okay with there being a different set of rights for young black people. I am perfectly okay with cops being able to Judge Dredd someone for being rude.  I believe people forfeit their civil rights by being pissy.

Think about that.","It seems like you're under the impression that sympathizers believe these victims did nothing wrong. But that's not what they're saying. They're saying the reaction to what the victims did wrong was radically disproportionate, and that if the same scenario occurred with a white person it would have ended differently. 

Let's think of this in terms of three tiers: 1) punishment for the original crime; 2) punishment for resisting arrest or otherwise compounding the original crime; 3) straight up killing the person. Nobody is arguing (well, *most* people are not arguing) against #s 1 or 2. They are arguing against #3 exclusively. There's an acknowledgment that these men did something wrong, and then something wronger, but that neither of those justifies getting shot. For example, Garner earned #1 for selling loose cigarettes, and #2 for swatting away the officer trying to handcuff him (even this is debatable, but I'll let it go for the sake of the bigger issue). But #3 shouldn't have even been on the table. The maneuver used on him wasn't authorized; he didn't need five different officers swarming him. That's the part people are mad about. No one thinks he should have just gotten off entirely. 

Is it a practical reality that they might have avoided death by being entirely submissive? Probably, sure. But most people aren't arguing against that either. Instead, they're arguing that 1) Changes need to be made to alter that practical reality and 2) An altogether *different* practical reality exists for white people. You say that it's not a matter of principle, but the debate you're watching *is* one primarily concerned with principle, as a means to effect a change in practical necessities down the road. Don't think for a second that the black community is somehow unaware of the best practices in dealing with the police, or surprised at what these actions bring on. What we're seeing is just cases where people get particularly scared, or frustrated, or whatever. And sure, their reactions are mistakes, both legally and practically. But they're very, very minor mistakes compared to people who earn their death, like a hostage taker or a mass shooter. 

TL;DR — Having sympathy is distinct from expecting exoneration. You can both acknowledge their wrongdoing and be angry at how their wrongdoing was handled, which is what most people are doing. This controversy is mainly dealing in principle, whether or not principle is important to you. Everyone is already aware of what should be done practically; they're protesting that necessity itself, and calling for policy changes that would alter it.",B,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

It also acknowledges the wrongdoing of the victims while still arguing against the excessive use of force. Reply B also highlights the importance of principle in addressing these issues and calls for policy changes to alter the current practical realities. Overall, Reply B presents a more comprehensive and thoughtful argument that is likely to challenge the original poster's perspective."
predict-explain,"I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say.  Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I look forward to hearing another point of view.

My main points:

1.) Physically.  Men dominate sports and physical events.  I can't think of one sport that women are better than men at, in general, and if there are a few, that's only a few, and men dominate the rest. 

2.) In the work place.  This is the most controversial part.  Women want equal pay, but from what I've seen in my limited 8 years in industry, is that women are not as good as men at their jobs.  My industry is oil refining.  99% of the plant workers are men, why?  I work in the Engineering office.  There are no women engineers, only secretaries, and some of them baffle me at how incompetent they are. (Admittedly our one secretary is excellent at her job, and does far better than I ever could.  But my point here is that a man could do that job just as well.) 

3.) At home.  This is where most of my point lies.  It could just be a gender roles thing, but why am I so much better at everything than my girlfriend?  I'm not saying I'm great, but rather most of the girlfriends I've had are completely incompetent at a lot of things.  Things like building an Ikea cabinet, she can't do it.  Small, mundane challenges like un-stacking and re-stacking a sleeve of solo cups.  We had to do it as part of a challenge, and I was much faster at it.  She couldn't figure out how the gear shifters worked on a newer mountain bike after riding it for 10 minutes.  I had never seen this type before, but figured it out in 10 seconds.  Not because I'm clever, but because it is simple and something I believe should be easy for any adult to figure out. 

These reasons are why I hold this view.  I look forward to being completely flamed for this view, and also for another perspective.  Thanks.

Yes, on average men are physically stronger than women.  (Of course, there are many women who are physically superior to many men.)

But that's like saying whites are inferior to blacks because they sunburn more.  You can't just pick a single attribute where there is a difference. 

Women are [demonstrably more empathetic than men](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19476221).  Does that make them superior, or just different?  Honestly, except for sports and the small subset of jobs that rely on brute physical strength, empathy is probably a more valuable attribute in both the workplace and in social situations.

Women also have tend to have much larger breasts than men - is that a sign of superiority?  Or just a sign that they are different?

**Workplace.**
Your entire argument is anecdotal - you work in a male-dominated industry (oil refining), in a male dominated department (engineering).  Let me counter first with my own experience - when I was managing a team of software developers, my best programmer hands down was a woman.  In fact, if I stack ranked them, the guys would all be at the bottom of the list.  

A couple of my sons best friends are women who just graduated high school, and are going on to major in engineering and computer science.  One of them is a technical whiz who pretty much ran the lights and sound for the theater and band programs and knew the sound and light boards better than any of the adults who worked there.

There is enough demand for competent women in STEM that they don't need to work in industries notorious for sexism, such as yours, so it's not surprising you don't see them.

**At home.**
I suspect that there are many things that your gf is stunned that you can't figure out.  Despite being pretty damn smart I suck at:

* ironing
* making hospital corners
* anagrams
* knowing what colors go together
* crafty stuff

My wife smokes me at all of these things - and destroys me at Boggle.

There are plenty of things that I'm better at, but the point is that we have a range of things we're good at.  We tend to put a higher value on those we are better at, and dismiss the things we suck at.

(Now, of course, it's possible your gf is completely useless, but then why the hell are you with her.)","&gt; 1.) Physically. Men dominate sports and physical events. I can't think of one sport that women are better than men at, in general, and if there are a few, that's only a few, and men dominate the rest.

This point is ridiculous. Am I superior to Stephen Hawking because he is physically weak? Am I inferior to every NFL player because they are physically strong?

Physical ability has absolutely no bearing on a person's worth.

&gt; 2.) In the work place. This is the most controversial part. Women want equal pay, but from what I've seen in my limited 8 years in industry, is that women are not as good as men at their jobs. My industry is oil refining. 99% of the plant workers are men, why? I work in the Engineering office. There are no women engineers, only secretaries, and some of them baffle me at how incompetent they are. (Admittedly our one secretary is excellent at her job, and does far better than I ever could. But my point here is that a man could do that job just as well.)
&gt; 

An anecdotal case and you are ready to write off half the human race? There are lots of cases of women being far superior to men at their jobs.


&gt; 3.) At home. This is where most of my point lies. It could just be a gender roles thing, but why am I so much better at everything than my girlfriend? I'm not saying I'm great, but rather most of the girlfriends I've had are completely incompetent at a lot of things. Things like building an Ikea cabinet, she can't do it. Small, mundane challenges like un-stacking and re-stacking a sleeve of solo cups. We had to do it as part of a challenge, and I was much faster at it. She couldn't figure out how the gear shifters worked on a newer mountain bike after riding it for 10 minutes. I had never seen this type before, but figured it out in 10 seconds. Not because I'm clever, but because it is simple and something I believe should be easy for any adult to figure out.

Another anecdotal case of one woman. This is honestly a very childish outlook.

**You also failed to mention how women can be viewed as *superior* to men.** Women are far more likely to graduate high school and college now. They  commit *extremely* low amounts of crime, violent or otherwise. They deal with people far better, and have a much better sense of empathy than the average man. They have been shown to be far far more responsible, and less prone to take unnecessary risks. The list goes on and on. Does this mean that women are better?",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides counterarguments to each of the original poster's points, using logical reasoning and examples to show that the original poster's views are based on anecdotal evidence and do not reflect the full range of abilities and strengths that women possess. 

Additionally, Reply A acknowledges the original poster's perspective while also providing a different viewpoint, which can help the original poster see the issue from a different angle.

predict-explain,"I recently got in an argument with a friend regarding the BLM (Black Lives Matter) interruption of Bernie Sanders speech. I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still hold its unacceptable to break the law the way BLM did. 

My friend argued back that since both of us are white, we can never understand the situation and the anger these representatives of BLM feel. Therefore, she argued, we cannot criticize their actions since we cannot and can never understand their perspective.

My friend showed me [this article](http://time.com/3605606/ferguson-in-defense-of-rioting/) in defense of her argument. I'll quote from the conclusion,

&gt;Instead of tearing down other human beings who are acting upon decades of pent-up anger at a system decidedly against them, a system that has told them they are less than human for years, we ought to be reaching out to help them regain the humanity they lost, not when a few set fire to the buildings in Ferguson, but when they were born the wrong color in the post-racial America.

In response to the article, I essentially argued that while I do feel for minorities in the U.S, violence is neither a morally sound or pragmatic way to go about change. I also felt that the argument presented (we are not minorities, therefore we will never be able to understand, therefore we cannot criticize) is fundamentally unsound.

I'd love to hear some support for her viewpoint, because I am an open-minded person and I care about racial equality America

&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Speaking of which,* ***[downvotes don't change views](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/guidelines#wiki_upvoting.2Fdownvoting)****!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","Sometimes you can be right and wrong at the same time.

Perhaps you are right in this one situation that it was wrong to break minor laws in order to protest.  But then you are in the game of choosing for protesters whose causes are worthy of civil disobedience and whose are not.  Safe to say the protesters themselves always feel their particular cause is worthy.

But that's not really the issue here.  Look at your headline.  You just assume to the people reading it that ""we"" means ""white people"" and ""their"" means minorities.  In fact, when I first read your headline I couldn't understand who thought white people couldn't be criticized.  Reread your sentence.  If you're not making major assumptions about race, it really reads like ""their"" are referring to the subject of your first sentence.

So I guess my question to you, if your racial blinders on so strong you can't even craft a headline without revealing a very narrow, very white view of things.  If you can be this oblivious in this one case, how are you sure any of your assessments regarding race are unbiased?

If you are a rational person, your own post should cause you to have serious skepticism towards any view you have regarding race, or as you might thing of it, how ""we"" deal with ""them"".","Is it your view that white people can criticize minorities without reservation?

I think it's also worth acknowledging that the context and audience of your criticism. If you're talking to a bunch of white people, it's worth recognizing that you all have hard to overcome biases and misconceptions about what it's like to be a minority. If you're talking to a group of black people as a white person, it's worth keeping in mind that your ethos may not be very strong. (and if you're talking to rando's on the internet both of those things may be true!)

So it may be incorrect so say as an absolute that white people can't criticize minorities, but I'd also say that it's very difficult to effectively and empathetically do so.

You might also want to consider that making moral judgements of *people* is a lot more complicated problematic than making moral judgments of *actions*. Is interrupting rude? Of course it is. But have you never done something rude? How do we begin to qualify your relative shitttyness to the BLM girl's shittyness, based on the severity and amount of rude things you two have done in your lives, in order to give your the moral high ground to criticize her character? (Assuming you think you need the moral high ground of course, but at the very least you'll agree that many people think that's an important thing.)

It's way easier to say ""it's rude to interrupt,"" and be done with it. Leave out the personal condemnations.",B,A,"I would say Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A brings up the point that the original poster may have biases that they are not aware of, and challenges them to consider how those biases may affect their views on race. This could prompt the original poster to reflect on their own perspective and potentially reconsider their stance on criticizing minorities. Reply B, while also making valid points, focuses more on the difficulty of effectively criticizing minorities as a white person, rather than directly addressing the original poster's argument. Therefore, Reply A's approach of challenging the original poster's biases is more likely to lead to a change in their view."
predict-explain,"People talk about 'natural' or 'God-given rights', but all rights can be taken from you. If rights like ""free speech"" or ""free association"" are 'inalienable', 'natural', or 'God-given', how come so many people don't have them. ""Rights"" are created by the state, on their terms.

I hear alot of people claiming ""The right to free speech"", or ""The right to the pursuit of happiness"". Looking at the world in these terms is false, misleading and detrimental to society. No rights are absolute- the world would be screwed if they were. Laws about inciting violence, truth in advertising, libel, slander, pornography, threats, extortion, racial vilification, sexual harassment, tax fraud and many, many more, all limit free speech, but are vital for society. 
Can I ""pursue happiness"" by running over the elderly in my F150, or selling crack to toddlers? But I got the ""right""!! right? All 'rights' have limits. Looking at things purely in terms of ""rights""
creates a selfish, narcissistic, entitled, unreasonable mindset.

Rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin, but there's no ""Bill of Responsibilities"". Talking about 'Rights' like this
makes people think they can do what they want, coz ""I got Rights!!"". 

Rights are a myth, and we need a better model for thinking about personal freedom.
_____","Former civics teacher here. Regarding your statement that 

&gt; Rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin, but there's no ""Bill of Responsibilities""

and the implication that we need to refer more to responsibilities of citizenship, I agree 100%. There is a sense of entitlement among American citizens today; I can't say if it's existed in other epochs, but it does seem to have a deleterious effect on our political discourse, and on civil society more generally.

That said, the notion that

&gt; Rights are a myth

and

&gt; 'Rights' are not a real thing. They exist only as much as the state allows

is a dangerous one. The notion of limited government, i.e. a government created of, by, and for the people, which can only create new laws within the framework of a constitution, exists to protect citizens from the excesses of unchecked government power. The companion notion of natural rights is necessary for the conception of limited government. If, as you claim, rights come *from the government*, what stops government from switching things up and determining that, for example, we don't have a right to due process? (Some would argue that this is already happening, but I'll get to that in a moment.) That we don't have a right to the proceeds of our labor? What if the President decided that he needed a new palace, that term limits--hell, even those pesky elections--aren't really necessary, and so he upped the tax rate to near 100% and declared himself emperor? Historically, all a ruler needs is the support of the elites and the military to make that happen. A generally-accepted belief in limited government and natural rights doesn't inherently prevent these abuses, but it's a very good first step. (It's especially a good step because the members of the military, who generally aren't the elites, will have been conditioned to believe in limited government just as they have been conditioned to follow strict lines of authority, so they're less likely to quietly sign on to a power grab by a rogue President.)

As to your point below that 

&gt; 'rights' aren't about compromise; they're about entitlement

this is patently false. Rights will necessarily conflict. There are very few moral systems that argue that there are not overlaps in rights, where priority must be given to some over others. (Modern American libertarians would make the argument that the Non-Aggression Principle is a single rule to determine all disputes, but this is problematic in its own right; for example, it allows for the extreme interpretation that my current self cannot 'enslave' my future self by signing contracts, making the entire institution of binding agreements null and void. I think that any moral system with this level of ""clarity"" necessarily tends toward allowing absurdity like this, if not actively encouraging it.) This is the reason we require a (preferably impartial) judiciary: to determine the precedence and priority of various rights. For example, in the most famous example, my 1st Amendment right to yell ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater has been deemed, rightfully, to be trumped by society's collective right not to have its citizens deliberately cause physical harm to others. (You could very easily frame that collective right as my responsibility not to cause physical harm to others, and I would agree with it.)

But wait, you say, that's **government** determining rights! You're [I am] wrong! Rights *do* come from government!

Well, not quite. As a civil society, we need some arbiter that we can all appeal to when our rights come into conflict. Since government has existed seemingly since time immemorial, we have attempted to harness its power to that end. And that's all government is, a way of aggregating power. We like to think that it represents and protects all of us, but government is very easily captured by people who have disproportionate power or wealth to begin with, making it a dangerous tool. Yes, we need government (or some other collectively agreeable arbiter) to decide questions of *whose rights or responsibilities win out in a conflict*, but that doesn't mean the rights in question came from government in the first place. Just because a corrupt government chooses not to protect a set of rights, or actively chooses to violate them (as many police forces seem to be ignoring our 4th Amendment rights, especially in seeking out citizens with drugs), **does not** mean that we didn't have that right to begin with. It is a precondition for challenging the government to the extent necessary to restore the rights. If, as you say, rights *come from government*, then we should ignore public outrage about the TSA, about the War on Drugs, about Ferguson and Baltimore and the myriad places where cops kill people of color, because those are all instances of government agents acting against private citizens. And if those agents, acting according to the rules of their agencies (which can't be doubted, since officers in these situations are extremely rarely prosecuted or punished), have denied citizens their rights, including their right to life, then that right must not have existed in the first place, right?","I'm not here to completely change your mind. On the responsibilities note:

My understanding of rights-based political philosophy is that rights are the bare minimum of what peoples generally agree on as the bare minimum of requirements for people to be able to pursue something like freedom or a good life. Rights aren't enabling you to do anything - they are restricting the government from interfering in your life. (The most cited example of this misunderstanding in the US is people who say ridiculous things and then cite the first amendment of the US constitution- the first amendment limits government censorship - not fellow citizens.)

The responsibilities bit is not brought up because (1) it is presupposed that most people won't step-up and (2) taking responsibility in open society has its own rewards. So on the first note, guess what there were drunks/deadbeats/dropouts in every day and age - and so you know that some people aren't even capable of a full public life (ie voting, volunteering, getting involved in the community, stepping up at work, etc, etc). Also, to be fair, a lot political philosophy was only about property-owning men - their very lives were based on their supremacy over everyone else. So for instance, you couldn't argue that non-property owning men and women would have public responsibilities because it would undermine the mental model of inferior women and non-property owners.

Point two, where responsibility is its own reward:
The other aspect of it is that it was assumed that if you became part of public society you got to do all these other fun things: dances, you could network for your job or future wife, meet interesting people, potentially take political office, siphon public funds etc etc.

The rights model is based on a morally-normative model and is therefore problematic. But this was known quite a long time ago: even Spinoza's (mid-1600's) political philosophy, more or less, replaces rights with abilities and interest.

But all philosophy aside- what is of dire interest to me is why Americans seem to be (1) uninterested in history and or (2) unwilling to hold our government to the basic principles of both our constitution and our founding.

It's very interesting to me that people rationalize government misdeeds and overreaches - or make ironic jokes about them. (""I'm sure I'm on a list somewhere."") Or they may simply shrug and say: ""They are only catching the bad guys."" As if that isn't how every horrifying misdeed starts or somehow makes it better that they lied to American congress.

TL;DR: You are right, rights aren't alright. Your terminology is slightly off.",A,A,"I would say Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a thorough explanation of the importance of rights in limiting government power and protecting individuals from potential abuses. It also addresses the misconception that rights are about entitlement rather than restrictions on government interference. The response effectively argues for the necessity of rights in a civil society and the potential dangers of disregarding them. Reply A also acknowledges the importance of responsibilities but highlights the crucial role of rights in upholding individual liberties. Overall, Reply A presents a well-reasoned argument that is likely to make the original poster reconsider their perspective on rights."
predict-explain,"I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a 'joke' as angry liberals make it seem.

What I'm trying to say, is that people should not be forced into believing and supporting gay marriage, gay/lesbian/transgender/pansexual and all that—they should be allowed to express their freedom of religion without the oppression of liberalism the way they expect not to be oppressed by conservatism. Seems very hypocritical, no?

The point here, is that staunch liberals have a very high tendency to be hypocritical towards religion, but get really offended when a conservative does the same towards them.

It all makes no sense to me, and I want to be open to changing my belief about this one way or the other. It's a big mess that aggravates me, because no one on the far sides of the spectrum sticks to their word very well. I'm a libertarian, so I have my likes and dislikes toward each side, and I would like to understand these specific viewpoints better.

EDIT: This blew up a lot more than I thought it would, which is good. I got a lot of clarification, and I've awarded some &amp;#8710;'s. To be more specific (if you're trying to step in my shoes), I USED to be a devout Catholic, until I thought some of the teachings were immoral and 'behind the times.' I just don't think that religion is a bunch of crap as some make it out to seem; however, since my view has been changed, I believe that as people should have freedom of religion, that freedom of religion can only go so far before it becomes a legal issue. I believe that freedom of religion already has a more bigoted starting point than the opposite viewpoint which is more 'realistic' shall I say.","Ok freedom of religion does not entail a number of things, first and foremost, you are free to practice your religion and others are free to criticize you or yes make fun of you for it (which makes them assholes, yes, but they are free to do so, just as you are free to mock non-religious people)

Second, denying a service of public accommodation to someone on the basis of religion is not allowed. This does not constitute an act of oppression.

In which ways are religious people being oppressed by liberalism?","&gt;What I'm trying to say, is that people should not be forced into believing and supporting gay marriage, gay/lesbian/transgender/pansexual and all that—they should be allowed to express their freedom of religion...

People are already free to practice their religion, they don't have to support LGBT people and they're not being forced to either. What they can't do, is impose their religious beliefs on other people, they can't get their religious beliefs enshrined into law. Religious people are in no way being oppressed by two gay people getting married, they just aren't allowed to dictate the rules on who gets to get married based on their religion.",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B directly addresses the original poster's concern about being forced to support beliefs that go against their religion. Reply B clarifies that people are already free to practice their religion and not support certain beliefs, but they cannot impose their beliefs on others or dictate laws based on their religion. This response provides a clear explanation of the separation between personal beliefs and legal rights, which may help the original poster better understand the issue at hand."
predict-explain,"I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer even use firearms (I mean the guns that can kill, I'm not sure since it's not my native language) if he/she doesn't intend to kill? I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing him/her, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen. Plus, even if the suspect is really guilty, a police officer shouldn't kill him/ her, right? And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?

First off, the doses of even the best drugs tend to be very sensitive.  We have to estimate the weight of the animal and put the correct amount of the drug in the needle.  While a good drug can account by us being off by a bit, it does not account for the danger of using a dose for a creature twice the size or bigger.  As humans have a large range of potential body sizes, that means that the police would not be able to have the darts pre-loaded and ready to go, but rather have to load up a dart with the drug while in pursuit and estimating their size.  That changes the time between deciding to use the weapon and using it from a few seconds to a few minutes (if not longer), which can mean the difference between life and death in a situation where using either weapon is needed.

&gt;And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier?  They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?

A 250 lbs man holding a 100 lbs woman still means that if she gets a dart meant for him in her, she will likely die.

Secondly, even in a perfectly healthy subject, there is a great deal of possibility of complications.  These drugs work by relaxing the muscles and/or paralyzing them, but that also applies to muscles like the diaphragm and heart.  When sedating an animal, we have to closely monitor their breathing and temperature to make sure that the drug is not causing problems and potentially administer counter agents.

Third, many humans already have drugs in their system, both legal and illegal.  Without knowing exactly what they have in them, it is impossible to know how the tranquilizer will interact.  It may make it useless, it may make it deadly, it may drive them into a berserker rage.  Without their medical history in from of us and a pharmacist, we cannot know.

Fourth, tranquilizers take a while to take effect.  It sometimes takes as long as several minutes after the drugs enter their system for it to impact them.  With an animal, we can easily sit back and observe them from a distance until they collapse, but with a criminal it will just give him a few minutes of doing whatever dangerous activity he is already engaged in.  Some people may react to being hit by a dart with anger and become more violent.  Also, if they happen to know the drug the police use, they may have a syringe of a counter-agent with them and be able to use the time to nullify the effect.

Fifth, darts are far less accurate than a regular bullet.  Distance must be carefully estimated and applied to whatever launcher is used.  Overestimating distance means the dart will not hit with enough force and not penetrate skin or will drop too much and miss entirely.  Underestimating distance means the dart not dropping enough and overshooting the target or hitting and doing severe damage with the impact.  This means that the chances of the police hitting their target at all are very low, and they must engage from a much shorter distance.

Finally, the darts are very difficult to get to inject even when they hit the target.  Often times simply fur is enough to stop a successful hit from injecting the drug and cause it to simply spray the outside of the animal.  A heavy coat, leather jacket, or a wide range of other possible clothing options can easily do the same thing and prevent the drug from entering the system of the target even on an accurate shot.

Overall, if I am going up against gun bearing criminal with either a tranquilizer gun or a baseball bat, I will take the bat because I will be more likely to win and I will be less likely to kill the criminal in the event of a victory.","Have you ever seen an anesthesiologist's paycheck? They get paid a lot, and a huge portion of what they get paid goes straight to malpractice insurance. This is because it's not easy to knock someone out, and it's even harder to do it without hurting or killing them. 

I'm no expert on tranquilizers but I know they are not the instant knock out guns movies make them appear to be. You have to get the drug in their system and it needs time to work. Time a person could use any number of ways, some dangerous.

Also, more importantly in my opinion, you're putting the person shot a risk. You're injecting an unfamiliar drug into their system. They could be allergic, or it could have an averse reaction with some other legal or illegal drug that they're taking. It could hurt them, cause permanent damage, or even kill them.

They also address the accuracy of tranquilizer darts, the difficulty of injecting the drug, and the potential for the suspect to have a counter-agent. 

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the risks and potential harm to the suspect being shot with a tranquilizer, without delving into the practical challenges and limitations of using tranquilizers in real-life law enforcement scenarios. While both replies raise valid points, reply A provides a more comprehensive and detailed explanation, which is likely to be more convincing to the original poster."
predict-explain,"This CMV is not about whether you or I believe aliens exist. It is about the widely held point of view: if you don’t think alien life exists elsewhere in the universe, you’re crazy. I understand where this view comes from; the [Universe is so unimaginably huge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17jymDn0W6U) and so filled with [galaxies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAVjF_7ensg), and therefore stars, and therefore [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exoplanets_discovered_using_the_Kepler_spacecraft), there simply *must* be other life out there. My view is that this approach is fundamentally unscientific and should not be held because it is based on probability and not actual scientific evidence.

My background: I am a physics and astronomy teacher, and I teach about this subject in depth every year. I think about it and research it often. I’m well acquainted with the [Drake Equation](https://xkcd.com/384/), the [Fermi Paradox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNhhvQGsMEc) and [its many possible solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fQkVqno-uI), the [Great Filter](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html), and the debate over alien life in general.

My own belief in the matter used to be strongly on the ‘of course aliens exist out there’ side, but I thought the distances were just too vast for us to ever observe them. However, my opinion was strongly shifted by the book *Alone in the Universe* by [John Gribbin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gribbin), and I now think that the great profusion of life here on Earth is so rare that we are alone in the Universe.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m completely open to the idea of aliens existing. I kind of hope they do, as long as they don’t destroy us all! But until we get any kind of scientific evidence that they exist — an organized signal, clear alien-made trace elements on a planet’s spectroscopy, anything measurable — I think the correct scientific approach is that they don’t exist. CMV.

Edit 1: Some good thoughts in here, thanks. Also, some incorrect assumptions about what I'm saying. Probability is of course a useful scientific tool, the key to our understanding of quantum mechanics. But guesses about the Drake Equation boil down to probability based on no data, quite different from the data-based probability of QM.

The most compelling argument that I've read below is that because we know life happened once in the Universe with us, it could happen again. Physical laws of symmetry point to the idea that there are no unique events in the Universe. I'm not sure I agree with that, but it's given me something to think about. And so the crux of the argument comes down to abiogenesis, life from non-life. Is it easy or hard? Could it have happened only once? *Alone in the Universe* argues that a LOT of things had to go just right for us to exist. I call these things 'Drake's Denominator' in class -- the scores of things that went just right for us that might kill the huge totals of galaxies, stars, and planets.

Edit 2: Delta awarded, thanks all for your thoughts. I realized that even the single data point we have about life, life here on Earth, makes it possible for other life to exist out there. We don't have any evidence yet, but it's not unscientific to imagine that it exists. I still think life is exceedingly rare out there, and perhaps we're alone. The strange thing is that we'll probably never know. The story about [Vlad the Astrophysicist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPl10L40pBM) is closer to my main view about aliens in general -- civilizations pop in and out of existence in no time at all, never having the chance to reach out across space and communicate.

We humans already developed here in the universe. proving that development of life in this universe is possible. We earth organisms are already ""proof"" for life in the universe. If the laws of nature allowed for us to exist and there is a significant statistical chance that there is other life out there (due to drake equation etc, but you know that already) then it's unscientific to not accept the existence of alien life.

Science dictates that the hypothesis that is the most statistically likely is the correct one. Unless new data refutes that hypothesis. Since alien life doesn't break the laws of nature (and some proponents think it's actually a system for entropy of energy.) And a HUGE statistical chance to be correct. (in the 99.9 and a lot of 9s after that) It's scientific to assume aliens do exist.","&gt;  I think the correct scientific approach is that they don’t exist.

Does the ""correct scientific approach"" have to be either they do or don't exist? Why can't the ""correct scientific approach"" just be that we don't know yet, we haven't observed any aliens, but here are some other facts we know about the universe and life that allow us to *estimate* probabilities and form a hypothesis that can undergo further testing.

What principle of science says that until you actually observe a phenomenon, the ""right"" thing to do is to take the null hypothesis, regardless of any other data you have the may imply otherwise?",A,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B presents a more balanced and nuanced approach to the question of alien life, acknowledging the limitations of current knowledge and the importance of forming hypotheses based on available data. By challenging the idea that the ""correct scientific approach"" must be a binary choice between believing in or denying the existence of alien life, Reply B encourages the original poster to consider the possibility of uncertainty and the need for further exploration and investigation. This approach is more likely to open up a productive dialogue and potentially lead to a shift in the original poster's perspective."
predict-explain,"From what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other.

The first faction is heavily focused on political correctness and the “social justice” movement. They are major proponents of multiculturalism. They tend to view human social behavior as being socially constructed, and the result of the environment, and are often hostile towards evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of outcome than equality of opportunity. Mainstream feminists fall into this category. They are also more likely to support gun control than the second faction. They have more female members compared to the second faction, and are more likely to be religious.
Examples of liberals in this faction include: Hillary Clinton, Laci Green, Mike Rugnetta, Trace Dominguez, PZ Myers, and Jen McCreight.

The second faction is liberal socially and economically, i.e. on abortion, gay marriage, drug liberalization, health care, etc., but is vehemently against the political correctness that the first faction espouses. They are also more averse to multiculturalism than the first faction. They tend to seek biological explanations for human behavior, and are more accepting of evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of opportunity than equality of outcome. Almost all of the members of this faction are atheists. This faction is much more heavily male dominated than the first faction. They are also more likely to support gun rights compared to members of the first faction. They also tend to be more likely to criticize mainstream democrats, such as Barack Obama. Examples of liberals in this faction include: Richard Dawkins, George Carlin, TJ Kirk, Phil Mason, and Carl Benjamin.","I'm not sure how exactly you can distinguish b/w these two ""factions"" based on the considerations you've provided. In my experience, members of the first faction are also socially and economically liberal on matters of abortion, gay marriage, health care, drug liberalization, and they do support multiculturalism. There's so much overlap that your theory doesn't make a whole lot of sense. 

It seems to me that you've just separated them based primarily on gender, not issues. Is that accurate?

Also, can you provide proof of Obama's atheism? I'd love to see it. He has said that he isn't very religious, but never said that he rejects god. I've never heard it.","It sounds like you're describing young liberals on the internet; I recognize the dichotomy you describe, and I would only object that it oversimplifies, but I'd also say you're missing out on a huge portion of liberals:

* Business liberals, who lean towards classic liberalism but still with leftist tendencies; basically center-left business people. A media example is the Economist.
* Radical leftists, who essentially reject capitalism and are deeply concerned with international issues, viewing most western diplomacy as imperialist or neocolonialist. A media example is Al Jazeera English.
* Unions and Labor. They draw from a long left-leaning tradition, even though their members are often socially conservative.
* The silent majority, who mostly favor liberal policies but would be very confused if you talked to them about how you thought evo psych was a defining schism issue in liberal politics.

Also, I'd point out that evolutionary psychology doesn't make normative prescriptions. For instance, we can accept the evo psych explanation for overconsumption of greasy and sugary foods and still acknowledge that a person's life benefits from a balanced diet. The same applies to any argument from evolutionary psychology.",B,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more nuanced and comprehensive view of the different factions within liberalism, pointing out that there are more diverse groups beyond just the two factions mentioned by the original poster. By highlighting the existence of business liberals, radical leftists, unions and labor, and the silent majority, Reply B challenges the oversimplified dichotomy presented by the original poster. Additionally, Reply B addresses the issue of evolutionary psychology in a more nuanced way, pointing out that accepting evolutionary explanations for behavior does not necessarily mean rejecting other perspectives. Overall, Reply B provides a more well-rounded and thoughtful response that is more likely to prompt the original poster to reconsider their initial categorization of liberals."
predict-explain,"I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into taking her's husband's last name, and gay spouses also have a conundrum of their own. 

However, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. One small example is if you work in an industry where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind (like I do). It's helpful to know in advance who is related to who by just looking at a piece of paper.

BUT, if the wife and the husband choose not to share a last name, please God settle on one name for your kid. Just flip a coin for which last name your kid takes if that's what you need to do. Don't make everyone around him have to deal with saying and writing out Reginald Henry Lieberman-Montgomery. 

A metaphor I would make for this would be gender pronouns. You have the right to tell me whether you identify as a man or a woman, but I swear to God if you insist that everyone around you refer to you strictly with the gender neutral pronouns Ni, Nem and Nir, I will be having none of it. 

As a counterpoint, I will say that I can't ever imagine myself taking my wife's last name. And if she chose not to take mine, I think I would feel a little disappointed. Further, I can't imagine feeling comfortable with my kid not taking my last name. So I already recognize a bit of the hypocrisy. In that way, I see that I am posing a problem without an apparent solution. On top of your rebuttals, I would also be curious to hear alternative ideas/social structures that could work to level the playing field, AND prevent me from having to say a mouthful. 

**EDIT:**

Apologies for the day long delay-- car emergency took all night and all morning.

Thanks for all your responses! Here are some of my views you've changed. 

Spain &gt; 'Murica. There's a clear system in place in Spanish countries that actually speaks to my ""one family name"" point. People consistently take the fathers, then mother's surname. Then the kid's kids will do the same. Gives you family history and also something to put on your mailbox. 

What I personally like about this is that it's uniform. If two last names were adopted country-wide in America, I would have much less of a problem with it. 

I also want to clarify: My problem with the ""mouthful"" of hyphenated last names does not mean that I would also suggest gentrifying the Krzyzewskis and the Chevaprevadumrongs of the world. To shorten your family name is to bastardize it. No ill feelings to those with shortened last names of course-- my last name was actually gentrified two generations ago. 

Finally, here is a post that very well summarizes my American sentiments: 

&gt; While this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to “People who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. People who name their kids something I dislike or don’t understand are selfish and stupid.” You have not said this, but I think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated.

&gt; You want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. If a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate.

My American sensibilities that shorter is better are deeply ingrained and will probably be there 'til I die. That said, at least I can recognize them so that I know to keep them in check. 

While I will continue to make fun of people who have two last names, it will be with the same conviction that I make fun of everyone else. No hostility here.

Thanks guys!","I think you already know you are rationally incorrect, but you are trying to justify an instinctive preference for the naming system that   ""feels"" right in your gut. The single-last-name-of-father system likely feels most correct to you because it (a) is most familiar and (b) gives you the most benefits while asking the fewest concessions. First, you know that you have an ingrained and biased preference about names: you prefer your wife and children take your name, but would feel uncomfortable or disappointed by the opposite. This is not a topic on which you are neutral and simply trying to find the easiest universal system.

As a measure of clarity – who is related to whom – hyphenating provides *more* information. The single-last-name system obscures familial relationships in comparison.

As a measure of legal identity – how many people share your name – hyphenating makes each name more distinct. 

I too work in an industry where I deal with thousands of names and families. The single last name system does not allow me to know “who is related to who” at anything better than an educated guess. I know dozens of families who share last names but no close relation. I know dozens of blended families. I know dozens of guardians who don’t share names with children, and committed couples who are not married. I also know siblings who get mistaken for spouses, and spouses who have been mistaken for siblings. Helping strangers make assumptions based on a single last name seems like the weakest possible defense. 

As a matter of personal identity – the right of a couple to determine family identity and choose names that are appropriate, representative, and meaningful – having a range of possibilities means couples can make a decision about how they understand their family construction. Group labeling and identity are incredibly strong sociological forces. 

As a measure of ease – spelling, length – that consideration does not exist in any other naming context, and it becomes absurd to try to impose the ease standard universally. If your wife had a much shorter last name than you, would it be inconsiderate to give your own name to your children? Is it unnecessarily complicated to give children a first name with more than one syllable? Is it unacceptable to name your child after your French mother if the name may be difficult for American businesses? 

Maybe more to he point, though, the difference in ease between the most complex and most simple names I have *ever* written has been minor - a dozen letters, a double-check on spelling, a confirmation. Literally a difference of a few seconds. 

While this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to “People who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. People who name their kids something I dislike or don’t understand are selfish and stupid.” You have not said this, but I think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated.

I do see nods to individual choice in your post, but only if you never have to interact with a world where people choose differently than you. 

Women should not have to take their husband’s name, but you only want to marry a woman who will. Men should have the option to take their wife’s name, but you'll never consider it. Children can have either parent's name, as long as yours have *only* their father's. Gay couples need ways to build family identity, but only if you don't have to see a hyphenated name.

You want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. If a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate. 

Also, as a side-note, it is a pretty well-documented phenomenon that people are less likely to change a position after taking a public stance. You begin by saying you have “had a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names.” If you have expressed “joking” superiority or derision towards people who do not like the same names you like, then you may feel compelled to justify that you were just smarter all along, rather than arbitrarily judgmental or dickish. 

Edit: Formatting","I don't understand the core of your argument. What's the *problem* with hyphenated names? It seems like the length is simply inconvenient for you. What if the husband's name is Lee and the wife's is Smith? Is Lee-Smith that difficult to write or say?



You say we should eliminate these names because it's an inconvenience to others. Do you think that when naming your newborn child, a parent ought to prioritize convenience? Families with rich cultural backgrounds should whitewash their families for your sake? Plenty of people have complicated last names as it is. Actress Michelle Pfieffer is an example; would you say she has a duty to society to *change* her generations-long family name for convenience's sake?",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"I've recently subscribed to r/anime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is massively misrepresented as mediocre among fellow fans and otakus. Currently ranked [#459 on MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online), this show scores an average rating of only 8 out of 10 nerd points.

I believe this is due primarily to *hater votes*. It should be in the top 50, if not top 25, anime of all time.

In fairness to the haters, the ALO arcs sort of ruined it with the whole sister romance harem thing. Japanese people are weird, but they sure know how to milk a hit show. For that reason, SAO II is not considered here; just vanilla SAO please!

Some Background

---

I am a 30-year old male product writer for the web, and I am not what most would consider an otaku or weeabo. (I prefer Korean culture, if we're comparing asking, and I don't go to cons, collect or read much Manga, or follow every anime series.) I watch anime recreationally, and consider myself a reasonable self-styled critic. I've recently watched quite a number of shows, being bored at home, and I've watched and rewatched SAO several times and am familiar with it.


---

**Why The Show Is Good**

Characters: The cast is great. Voice acting isn't overdone or underdone, and the characters all feel like people from a real world stuck in a game for a long time together. It also makes sense that they're all there.

Plot: The premise is not made of solid gold, but it's interesting enough to lend itself to greatness. If you die in the game, you die for real no quitsies. This has been done before in fiction, of course. However, SAO takes a different treatment of this premise. Normally, you would see horror, like in a show like Gantz, applied, or game aspects, such as in No Game No Life. 

SAO's goal is rather to show that a virtual world can be real and fulfilling. Its creators accomplish this by focusing not on the MMO aspects, which are limited to flavor, but rather on the interaction between strong characters and the tension of being trapped within this scary world. The story itself lends itself to a rich world, and the writers take advantage of the larger arc to fit in almost a dozen sub-arcs in 24 episodes. The show is *very* story dense for an anime; normally, a single sub-arc would take 4-6 episodes. These sub-arcs balance developing the world, fighting, and building relationships. The characters build on their strengths and flaws and often find themselves in situations partially crafted of their own making. (Example; Asuna is hard on her guild and pushy, and this results in a poor culture within the guild that causes problems as the series develops.) There are no unbelievable moments.

In the end, the heroes triumph, but it's not a boring triumph. They often sacrifice during the show and make many mistakes that weigh upon them. At the ending bar scene, you can feel the air of both relief and regret washing over all of the former players.

At the symbolic level, SAO is very symbolic of life itself. God puts us on this plant, and we don't get to leave unless we die. So we adapt to it and live in it, the same as in SAO's virtual world. This allegoric story pairs well with the show's many slice-of-life scenes, creating a very vibrant and real-seeming virtual world.

**Writing:** SAO does not waste time or words. No episode is filler, and each main character is multi-dimensional and arrives naturally in the main story arc. Characters do not break character. Villains are villains. Episodes are succinct and *excellently paced.* This show is so clean that you can eat off of it.

**Art:** The art direction is superb. Each character's outfit is suitable for their personality and status. Motion and combat is more fluid and direct as well as it was in Fate: UBW and other highly regarded similar shows. It was smoother than classic epics like Record of Lodoss War and Gurren Lagann or modern releases like Arslan. Admittedly, it probably had a bigger budget than those shows, but that shouldn't be a detracting factor at all. The only *fantasy world* anime I would give a higher regard to in art direction is Berserk, but in quality of animation, SAO crushes Berserk.

The only complaint you could make in the art department is that the show wasn't stylized enough to differentiate it from other fantasy anime.  For instance, the art direction in Kill la Kill was an incredible thematic rush of color with awesome hand-painted backgrounds. I'll grant that point, but can you name a fantasy anime with a better quality of animation offhand?

**Avoids Most Awful Anime Pitfalls:** Fanservice, chibi conversations, people falling off of park benches or turning into paper; these are the marks of an anime breaking the fourth wall and ruining suspension of disbelief for the view. In short, they're signs that an anime doesn't take itself seriously. Almost no anime of any level of notoriety, excluding comedies, uses these generic tactics.

---

**Arguments Against**

&gt; Overpowered Main Character

The story follows Kirito, a regular guy with some Kendo training and beta test experience in an online game. Kirito earns almost all of his levels solo and is on par with the very best fighters in the game. He starts off with an advantage due to his experience, gets full exp. for the very first boss, and grinds pretty much every day from there on out to stay on top of the curve. He clearly earns his main character slot through a number of trials instead of being handed it by the divine will of the writers, such as in every other anime ever. He is given a unique skill, eventually, which is powerful, but it's relatively balanced because it's difficult to use. His backstory and skillset are reasonable, and given that there must be a ""best"" among all the players, it makes sense that the show would follow him.

Meanwhile, in How to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, the main character is literally given a skill that says ""become overpowered against things you can't beat."" It's shit like that which makes me want to throw my laptop.

&gt; Dumb Plot Moments

In the first or second episode, another beta tester dies in Kirito's arms not because he was defeated, but because he turned down a potion. That guy was obviously a fuckin' idiot, and that scene could have been saved if he had just drank up and laid there. This is a fair criticism. Additionally, the army guild unit that marches in to fight the minotaur boss half dead is also made of retards. However, it's noted in the show that the reason they do this is because the army has been terrorizing its members. However, those deaths serve a purpose within the show and are not overtly distracting. The dumb beta guy's death serves to inspire Kirito to action and turns him into the MC. The dumb army guys are, much like the group that runs into the trap room early in the series, there to set Kirito on the right path and force him into action.

In the meantime, how will you excuse characters like Faye Valentine in one of your favorite anime, Cowboy Bebop? She's just there to be a plot instigator with a pair of giant boobs. Almost. Entirely. Fanservice. Many other very good anime have done much much worse with their cast and still rank top 50. Hell, Hajime no Ippo is fan ranked 20 on MAL, and although I won't disagree that the show is awesome, it's just following the formula of a hundred other sports anime shows like Prince of Tennis. OWARI NO SERAPH is even up there, and that show literally only has one redeeming character -- who isn't in most episodes. Hell, characters are invented out of thin air and people do dumb shit in Game of Thrones every other episode. Are you really going to say that SAO's weak point is a few serviceable plot blunders and side characters that didn't think through some obvious mistakes?

&gt; You didn't like the ending

The ending probably irked a few of people because it was so sudden. However, that's really the magic of the series. It's a virtual world controlled by a nutty, manipulative scientist-god whose purposes are unknown. That's the driving mystery behind every episode. Why are they even there? Why is the NPC planted in the guild as the final boss? Why is the psychologist AI disabled?

Without that underlying tension, the series doesn't take shape. The story is about human actors making intense decisions, and the elusive creator adds another layer to the conflict. It makes the story feel bigger than it is and every victory seem hollow. This in turn allows our main characters to keep driving forward.

Plus, they've already put in so many boss fights. I thought the defeat of the technically invincible guild leader was an awesome way to end, although it's obviously hedging a sequel.

I'm tired of typing, so I won't bore you with more examples. Although I really wish they had done much more with the sequels, I believe the original series ranks among the best-produced, best scripted, cleanest, most heartfelt Anime of all time. I look forward to your spirited replies.

The first arc is pretty great but I feel a lot of potential was missed out on and I would put a lot of more expanded and complete . I know it is based on the light novel series but feel that the anime could use a western comic book style reboot/reimagining. The original light novel was written as a stand alone work and the author did not anticipate how successful it would be.

The reset would create an expanded anime in the setting of Sword Art online with an expanded focus (as in some episodes featuring Asuna and others without Kirito) that fills in the details of the over two year timespan of the over two year life of the game. So many things weren't explored enough like Kirito's beater status and people's negative perceptions of him, how Asuna's character developed to be so strong, the solidification of the Knights of the Blood Oath along with development and foreshadowing of Heathcliff's very important character, and making the game feel like more of a world overall. 

I feel if they did that and made it end when the game ended would allow it to contend as one of the greatest anime's all time. The anime right now suffered from not developing enough plot lines and from the way it is dragging on.","For an anime to be *one of the best of all time,* it needs to stand out in an extraordinary way. What you've said is basically ""the voice acting is good but not extraordinary, the plot is good but not that good, the art is really good but still bested by other anime, it avoids most major pitfalls...""

What makes this anime *fantastic?* what makes it stand out above everything else? What makes it *unique?*

A side note: I would warn you against using an anime's Netflix ratings to determine how great it is. Critic ratings and similar are probably much better.

When a Netflix watcher rates a series low, it's because they personally didn't like it. Remember that Netflix gives you suggestions based on your ratings of previous movies. It actually has a message that says ""did you like this? If so, give it lots of stars and we'll suggest more similar!

I watched about 3 episodes perhaps a year ago. I hated it. I was expecting a shonen story with lots of interesting fights and battles. Instead, I got so much chat, development of relationships, and tearful good-byes, and so little *fighting,* that I thought I had stumbled into a gay romance anime.

predict-explain,"Written hastily, but hopefully I can clarify any mistakes in comments, here we go:

The Confederacy was racist according to the cornerstone speech and secession papers (tx):
[Cornerstone Speech] excerpt (http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/cornerstone-speech/)t:

&gt; Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, **its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition**

[Texas secession papers] excerpt(https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/secession/2feb1861.html):

&gt; She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery--the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits--a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time.

If the new government the Confederacy was trying to replace the current one with was based on that Cornerstone, there is no denying the Confederacy was racist. Those that fought for the cause of the Confederacy and helped further it, helped further ""the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and normal condition"" are culpable.

Point 1: Someone who fights for a racist cause, helps create an institution to power that racism, and otherwise spread it is racist. People who have done this don't deserve to be monumented, or at the very least don't deserve to be monumented something as defining as a town square.

Point 2: A monument with the words ""Our Confederate Soldiers"" cannot monument just the soldiers without endorsing their actions to some extent.

Point 3: The image of a Confederate soldier being a defining landmark in the center of a city is an endorsement of the Confederacies actions and perpetuates racism by virtue of it being a defining part of the cityscape.

A similar example I can think of is Nazi Germany. Under this point, any soldier of WW2 fighting for Germany would not deserve to be honored even if they weren't fighting for *the idea* of Nazism, but rather their homeland.

[Karl-Heinz Rosch](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/controversial-memorial-honor-wwii-german-soldier-karl-heinz-rosch.html) has a monument made of him, even though he was Wehrmacht. I believe he did heroic acts in the name of his country, not in the name of racism against the Jews.","Just because the Confederacy was founded out of a disagreement about slavery (which up until then, the north had been perfectly fine with, too), doesn't mean that you can just equate Confederate soldiers with racism.  Most of the people fighting for the Confederacy weren't fighting for racism.  They were fighting to save their own towns and homes and families.

Look at it this way.  Let's say another country has had enough of America's shit and decides to attack us.  Iran or whoever starts landing ground troops in your hometown and is systematically working their way through your town, murdering your children, torching your homes, and raping your families.  

Are you going to ask yourself if you believe in America's cause before you try to defend your family?  Or are you going to fight tooth and nail to save yourself?

Does that make you a supporter of whatever made America go to war in the first place?  Should we all forget what happened to you if it's later decided that we were actually in the wrong?",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

This is because Reply A provides a relevant and compelling example of how soldiers can be honored for their heroic acts in the name of their country, even if the cause they were fighting for was ultimately problematic. The example of Karl-Heinz Rosch, a Wehrmacht soldier in Nazi Germany, illustrates that soldiers can be honored for their actions without necessarily endorsing the ideology they were fighting for. 

On the other hand, Reply B's analogy of defending one's town and family from an invading force, while emotionally powerful, does not directly address the issue of honoring Confederate soldiers and their association with racism. It focuses more on the personal motivations of individual soldiers rather than the broader implications of honoring Confederate soldiers in public spaces. Therefore, Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view by providing a relevant and thought-provoking example."
predict-explain,"Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out.  
  
Vietnam was essentially a communist state, due to influences from China and USSR, which were alliances (the former is debatable) of Vietnam during the war. After the war, our country has suffered multiple economic depressions, and famines due to the incompetence of our liberally named Communist Party. Granted the South Vietnam government wasn't any better, but what the U.S wanted for Vietnam was for the best.  
  
I understand that, technically the US did not wage war with our people, but stood against the spread of communism in Asia, and with our strategic location, a battle surely followed. The US did not deliberately invaded our country. And look at what they did to the world. ~~Defeated the Nazis and fascist countries~~, uplifted South Korea, Japan (which were both smaller and less resourceful than my country) to their respectable position on the world map today. And what had the sole communist party in my country done? Nothing but left our people in the struggle of a third-world country. And China is still brazenly harassing our borders and seas to this very day, just because our army is incapable of standing up for themselves.  
  
~~Please tell me if I was wrong and why the North won was a good idea.~~  
  
Edit: My view has changed. It was not simple as I thought it was. Generally it can be summarized into those points: involvement of China, motives and war crimes committed by the US, and there was no hope in the governing system. Communism has not helped our people a bit, but no one can really advocates for America either. We as a nation should look to develop our own path. Insights are still very much appreciated. And thanks for the discussions.","I have nothing but admiration for the Vietnamese people. Within a span of 30 years the French were expelled, the United States was stopped from partitioning or exerting control over the country, and shortly thereafter a Chinese invasion was repelled. The Vietnamese also deposed the Khmer Rogue in Cambodia, a regime responsible for massacring millions of people.

Understandably, you look to countries that have done well out of being within the US sphere of influence, like South Korea. Remember though that the Rhee regime, which was supported by the US during the Korean war, was also responsible for massacring 100's of thousands of civilians. At the time, alignment with the great power that would exert the least influence over Vietnam (the Soviet Union) was likely the best option.

Your people have a heroic history and you should be proud of it.

""""The last time the Chinese came, they stayed a thousand years. The French are foreigners. They are weak. Colonialism is dying. The white man is finished in Asia. But if the Chinese stay now, they will never go. As for me, I prefer to sniff French shit for five years than to eat Chinese shit for the rest of my life."" — Ho Chi Minh, 1946

The same thing would have happened if Vietnam was partitioned or fell within the US sphere of influence.","I think there's a fundamental problem with your premise. If you look at HOW the war started, you will see more issues with US involvement. The US acted as an aggressor.

They transformed a struggle that was essentially anti-colonialist (which they should have supported, based on their propaganda about freedom and shit), into a war-of-the-worlds-anti-communist struggle. They supported a corrupt government in the South (just like in Korea before the war there), which had no legitimacy, no credit, and no real power. Why do you think the Viet Cong was so successful? Poor people hated that government. (Just like in Korea, by the way...)

They also lied about an incident to get involved in the actual war (Gulf of Tonkin), and then they proceeded to massacre between 2 to 4 million of your countryfellows, bombed Laos and Cambodia, and enabled the Khmer Rouge to commit their own atrocities.

Had the US not interfered in the original struggle against the French, there would probably not have been Chinese/Russian involvement in the same extent. The Domino Theory was a paranoid delusion, and it caused immense suffering to your country.

As for which overlords are better? Look at Latin America, if you want to see what life under US influence is. (Well, was.) Look at Nicaragua, Columbia, El Salvador, Chile, etc... not nice places to live (and die, unless you like being thrown out of airplanes, or killed for demanding 10cent more for the hourly wage of banana pickers). The Commies were not much better, either (I grew up in Central Europe on the other side of the Iron Curtain), but they at least took some social issues seriously, and invested in education, healthcare and other stuff, which were somewhat beneficial, even if it was stupid at times, like pushing for heavy industry in agricultural countries. (Just look how Afghanistan looked like in the 70s...)

The US involvement was wrong both morally and legally. From there it makes no difference what the outcome would have been; but if you really want to think about it, you might want to look at South Korea on the bright side, or the Philippines, Latin America on the dark side. An almost fascist dictatorship slowly transforming into a (relative) democracy vs a banana republic plagued by corruption, coups and death squads.",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B provides a more detailed and critical analysis of the US involvement in the Vietnam War, highlighting the negative consequences and atrocities committed by the US during the conflict. Reply B also compares the potential outcomes of different overlords (US influence vs communism) in a more nuanced way, acknowledging the flaws of both systems but also pointing out potential benefits of communist regimes in certain aspects like education and healthcare. Overall, Reply B presents a more comprehensive argument that challenges the original poster's beliefs and provides a more convincing case for reevaluating their perspective on the Vietnam War."
predict-explain,"I am an American High School student who was taught 2 different versions of the Civil war throughout my schooling career.

In elementary school we first learned about the civil war in fourth grade. In that unit, we were taught the very bare details of the war: The south seceded when they couldn't keep their slaves, and declared war on the north in doing so, Lincoln was a great guy who freed all the slaves with the emancipation proclamation, and then the north won.

In 8th grade I was taught more details to the story. The south seceded because the right of the states to decide on whether they keep slaves was being questioned, as well as there being the beginning of unequal representation of slave-nonslave states. The south secedes, war begins. I was taught this more comprehensive view in more detail in my junior year of High School, with emphasis on the economic and cultural dichotomy of the north and south: The north was a manufacturing powerhouse that didn't need slaves, and the South was largely agricultural and couldn't afford to *not* use slaves.

I, as a student, preferred being taught the States' rights version of the civil war, as it shows that the South was not comprised of nothing but slave-owning bigots, but that both sides were trying to preserve their way of life. This also allows for a better understanding of the reasoning behind how Reconstruction and Civil rights' issues were handled in the south.

I want to understand why people are against this form of teaching the civil war, so please, CMV

There's an old adage that in elementary/middle school you learn that the Civil War was about slavery, in high school you learn that it wasn't just slavery, but also X Y and Z so therefore it wasn't *really* about slavery, but then in college/university you learn that yes X Y and Z (industry v. agriculture, western expansion, relations with foreign powers, especially the UK and France, etc.) were issues, but that they could all be traced back to the divisive issue of slavery, so it's fair to say that the institution of slavery was the divisive factor in the Civil War, and the main reason that the **slave states** seceded from the Union. It's also worth noting that you can say the Civil War was primarily caused by the question of slavery, while still noting that not all Southerners were slave-owning bigots, or that all Northerners were abolitionist saints. And by simply stating that the South was trying to ""preserve its way of life"" glosses over the fact that their ""way of life"" rested upon their need to enslave other human beings to maintain it, and is a common staple of Confederate apologia. 

Here's a good quote from an AskHistorians poster

&gt; Essentially, the war started over disunion: The South wanted to dissolve the Union and the North was willing to fight to preserve it. The war was caused by slavery. Essentially all the differences which were large enough to affect the conflict were rooted in the relative presence or absence of slavery: the social differences, the economic interests, the states' rights argument, the political interests, everything.

There's also the issue of the Fugitive Slave Law, a federal law pushed for by Southern congressmen which required Northerners and Northern states to hand over slaves that escaped to the North. A Northerner in this scenario might claim that Southern congressmen were impeding on their own states' rights with overreaching federal legislation, wouldn't it? These Southern congressmen were perfectly fine implementing federal laws infringing on ""states' rights"" so long as it meant that they got to keep their slaves.","From the Confederate States Constitution:
&gt;    Article IV Section 3(3)
    The Confederate States may acquire new territory; and Congress shall have power to legislate and provide governments for the inhabitants of all territory belonging to the Confederate States, lying without the limits of the several states; and may permit them, at such times, and in such manner as it may by law provide, to form states to be admitted into the Confederacy. In all such territory, the institution of negro slavery as it now exists in the Confederate States, shall be recognized and protected by Congress, and by the territorial government: and the inhabitants of the several Confederate States and Territories, shall have the right to take to such territory any slaves lawfully held by them in any of the states or territories of the Confederate states.

If the Confederacy was about the rights of states, why does their constitution specifically restrict the rights of any new state to determine for themselves if they want to be a free state or a slave state?",A,B,"I believe that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a more nuanced and detailed explanation of why the teaching of the Civil War as primarily about states' rights can be problematic. It emphasizes the role of slavery as the root cause of the conflict between the North and South, while also acknowledging that not all Southerners were slave-owning bigots and not all Northerners were abolitionist saints. 

Reply A also addresses the issue of states' rights in a more comprehensive way, pointing out how the Fugitive Slave Law contradicts the idea of the South fighting for states' rights. It provides historical context and quotes from historians to support its argument.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses on a specific aspect of the Confederacy's constitution, which restricts the rights of new states to determine their stance on slavery. While this is a valid point, it does not provide as much context or explanation as Reply A.

Overall, Reply A presents a more well-rounded argument that addresses multiple facets of the issue, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"Adult tickets cost more than child's tickets for anything that distinguishes the two and often this makes sense. Adults have more money than kids and can afford the higher prices. Kids pricing allows family's to be able to afford to go to things as a family. For certain things, size does matter (fuel costs for transportation) and most adults are bigger than most kids and so should get charged more. And specific to theaters, adults are more likely to see an R rated and since the R-ratings are somewhat prohibitive in terms of selling tickets, I could see some sort of roundabout justification for increasing tickets prices for adults as they are likely to see a movie that falls into this mildly ""niche"" category of movies. 

I think the problem I have is that most (if not all movie theaters) consider you and adult at thirteen or fourteen. This doesn't make any sense. A thirteen year old doesn't have much more money does a twelve year old. They don't even have the right to work for another few years. They're not much bigger than a twelve year old and even if they were it wouldn't really matter because its not like bigger movie goes are more costly than a small movie goer. They can't see rated R movies. It seems like the only ""right"" they've acquired is to technically see a PG-13 movie but they probably could do that before age thirteen and it hardly seems to justify a price increase. I know that thirteen is not universal but I find it wrong to charge adult prices for anyone under eighteen (you could maybe argue seventeen since they can see rated R movies and can work).

Please leave the footnote below the following line, but remember to delete this sentence by replacing it with the body of your post. Thank you!

If a parent is going to take their kids somewhere, cost will certainly be a factor. If they have to pay full price for multiple tickets than it might make them choose somewhere else to go. By giving a discount for young kids they attract more business from parents. 13 or so is about the age kids start going to movies with friends instead of their parents. Sure they are still borrowing money from their parents, but now the few extra dollars for a ticket isn't as big of a deal since they are only paying for one ticket instead of 2 or 3 or however many kids they might have.","There are three justifications for the price differences for children under 13. 

First, teenagers and young adults attend the movies more often than any other demographic. That group is over represented - People from 12-18 represent only 8% of the population but represent 16% of the movie going audience and 18 to 24 year olds represent 19% of the audience but just 10% of the population.  However, children under 12 are underrepresented - they make up just 7% of the typical movie going audience while being 14% of the population. (By the way, these stats are from 2010 since I couldn't find anything more recent).  The only other group that is significantly underrepresented are seniors. 
So the theater industry offers discounts to those underrepresented groups needs to incentivize them to attend. Thus, we regularly see discounts for senior &amp; children 12 and under at movie theaters.   However, since teenagers are showing up in numbers already, it doesn't make sense to target them with a discount. You want them paying full price.  

Second , as was mentioned above, is that a lower child price targets families. It's essentially making attending the movies as a family less expensive and thus more attractive option.  Other groups - a pack of teenagers for example - are less likely to consider the total cost for the group since they will be paying for their tickets individually. However,  families are going to be very aware of the total cost since they will not be paying individually.  And, they will be comparing that total cost against other entertainment options. So a teenager might be asking ""is it worth $15 bucks to see this movie with my friends"" while a family of four  is asking ""is $60 worth it to see this movie.""  Once you start considering that total cost, it may not sound like much of s value. So, theaters improving that value proposition with a discount makes sense. 

Finally, I'd argue that in general the younger a person is, the less they get out of a movie. Now, that's not true for all movies. But, if a parent is considering attending let's say a typical drama, I think you would conclude that your 11 year old might not appreciate or understand that movie well enough to justify the $15 a full priced ticket will cost.  That is not to say the child won't get any enjoyment out of that movie, but a lower price might convince a parent to bring a child that they wouldn't for full price. Also, and I think more importantly, that parent might not attend that movie unless they can take their child (think single or stay at home parents, or just those unwilling to attend the movies without their children).  Now, like a said, I don't think this is true for every movie, but for certain movies a discounted child ticket price can be justified by young children being less able to appreciate those movies.",B,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a more in-depth analysis of the reasons behind the pricing differences for children under 13, including statistical data to support their points. They explain how targeting families with lower child prices can make attending the movies more affordable and attractive, as well as how younger children may not fully appreciate certain movies, making a lower price more justifiable. Reply B also acknowledges that the teenage demographic is already overrepresented in movie attendance, so offering discounts to them may not be as necessary. Overall, Reply B provides a more thorough and well-reasoned argument for the pricing structure, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"In New Zealand between the last two elections there was a significant increase in funding pushing for a better voting turnout. For many years now they have made it compulsory to register, however measures such as these seem to be highly ineffective globally at getting an increased turnout in elections, not just NZ. There was less than a 5% increase in voting in the last election despite it being a far more prominent election due to the kim dot com saga. National, our right wing party won so promisingly they were able to not form a coalition with other groups (this is almost unheard of in NZ). Many of my peers did not vote, nor did I as we believed that john key was a poor choice for a leader, but there was a lack of any leader that appealed to this group of 10 of us. We all agreed at the time that if there was a vote that had no significance in the election other than to measure those people who do not believe we have any valid current person running for prime minister we would not only have a higher turnout at the election with little effort, but we'd also have a better idea of what the general perception was on the stability of the political scene. This would help us to build a better political scene long term and involve the voter, ultimately resulting in higher voting turnout at a fraction of the cost or social effort and would result in a better turnout. This would theoretically apply globally too, as in countries such as the US it could be used to show many things, not just the (lack of) confidence in either leader, but also other things. I don't know any hurdles that would stop this from being non viable. Implementation might be a challenge but it could easily be overcome and the benefits would well outweigh the costs and implementation efforts","What would the purpose of this vote be? I mean, you can't just elect nobody?

When there is an election, somehow, a decision has to be made. And in a democracy, it is normally the people deciding which one from the list of candidates they want to choose. However, electing nobody is not a choice. Therefore I think adding a ""no confidence"" would only encourage the average voter to distance himself from every candidate and refuse his vote.
If someone is really unhappy about the way politics work, he should be able to participate himself as a politician. (I wrote should, because it is in many cases not very easy to do so)
If many people are unhappy with the voting system, maybe this could be revised in a way which encourages more voters to participate instead of refusing their vote.","What does a victory for the ""no confidence"" choice entail?  If none, I think it won't have much effect.

The US state of Nevada has had a choice called [""none of these candidates""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_These_Candidates) since 1975, but it lacks any force, and even if it gets more votes than any other choice, the actual person who got the most votes is elected.

In the last Presidential election, [Nevada had slightly lower than average turnout.](http://www.electproject.org/2012g)",B,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

Reply B, on the other hand, simply provides an example of a similar concept without offering much analysis or alternative solutions. Overall, reply A engages with the original poster's ideas and offers a thoughtful perspective on the topic."
predict-explain,"From https://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates

&gt; The majority of sexual assault are not reported to the police (an average of 68% of assaults in the last five years were not reported).1 Those rapists, of course, will never spend a day in prison. But even when the crime is reported, it is unlike to lead to an arrest and prosecution. Factoring in unreported rapes, only about 2% of rapists will ever serve a day in prison.

I think the conviction rate of sexual assault is woeful in this country. It is so difficult to make a successful criminal case against a rapist that:

- Rape culture is highly prevalent and rapists feel they can get away with it, and intimidate their victim into silence
- Victims of rape have no confidence they will even be listened to, never mind getting a successful conviction

For these reasons, I think the system should change:

- When somebody makes an accusation of rape, it should be up to the accused to prove their innocence. Until they have done this, they should be considered guilty. The accused's details should be publicized in this time, so the public is protected from them
- Rape cases should be fast tracked through the legal system, which not only streamlines the process, but shortens the time until the rapist is in prison, again this protects the public

Implementing these changes will give victims so much more confidence when reporting the crime, and it will make rapists think twice before they go ahead with their actions.

I have considered the possibility of a small amount innocent people going to jail for rape, but if these changes help send more *real* rapists to prison, then surely the benefit to society outweighs any minor problems that may arise.

I have been told I'm extreme for thinking this, but nobody has presented to me a compelling reason why it's a bad idea. Please change my view!

Edit: I have awarded deltas to /u/Aftercourse and /u/Da_Kahuna. My view is certainly changed, and I realize now that a lot of injustices would come from my proposed changes.","While I understand where you are coming from, and agree that measures should be taken, I don't think what you propose would be fair or effective because:

* Imprisonment [simply does not work](http://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/e199912.htm) as a measure to reduce recidivism. At all.

* 7% of inmates [report being raped](http://www.justdetention.org/pdf/struckman.pdf). I don't think you want to be putting people into a situation where their chance of rape is that high without very good reason.

* Legally, the presumption of innocence is enshrined in the US constitution. To presume someone guilty merely on someone's word is illegal.

* Morally, it is better to set a hundred guilty people free than to punish one innocent person. Thus the presumption of innocence.

* Publicising someone's information in relation to an accusation of rape can be harmful enough to them to be consstrued as punishment, and shouldn't be done without a guilty verdict.

I would propose a different set of changes:

* When somebody makes an accusation of rape, ~~assume they are telling the truth  (edit: insofar as that a rape occurred)~~ edit 2: do not assume they are lying, and forward them to detectives trained to deal with rape victims.

* Make sure they have access to any medical or mental health facilities they need. This is the important thing, as punishing someone will not help the victim, regardless of their guilt.

* Investigate in good faith. Collect any available evidence, and where there is evidence, actually analyse it. This is [not what is done currently](http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/unanalyzed-evidence-sexual-assault-cases), which is probably a big reason for the woefully inadequate conviction rates you see.

* If there is enough evidence to prove someone guilty, send them away. If there is not, we can't be certain enough of their guilt to punish them in good faith.

Punishing an innocent person won't help the victim. It will only harm the innocent person. Punishing a guilty person won't help the victim, it will only harm the guilty person.

Stopping rapes in the first place would be the most desirable solution, but I can't offer any magic bullets there.","Our legal system is centred around the idea that it is better to set a guilty person free than to jail an innocent person. If we shift the burden of proof to the defendant, it becomes much easier for people to bring malicious accusations against someone. It is often very difficult to prove that you didn't do something. For this reason, in criminal cases, all the defence must to is argue that the prosecution hasn't made their case well enough; they don't have to argue that there is positive evidence that the defendant is innocent.

If this change were to be implemented, almost everyone accused of rape would be convicted, regardless of their guilt or innocence. This would result in many innocent people having their lives destroyed. It's simply not worth it.

The current system is far from perfect; it makes it almost impossible to get a conviction. That being said, we should focus on making it easier for victims to report crimes. This requires a major culture shift away from victim blaming. Streamlining the reporting process is not a bad idea. Shifting the burden of proof is unimaginably ill-advised.",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a more balanced and nuanced approach to addressing the issue of low conviction rates for sexual assault cases. It acknowledges the importance of supporting victims and investigating cases thoroughly, while also respecting the legal principles of presumption of innocence and due process. 

On the other hand, Reply B focuses on the potential dangers of shifting the burden of proof to the defendant and the risk of convicting innocent people. It highlights the importance of protecting the rights of the accused and emphasizes the need for a fair and just legal system.

Let's start off by [reading the statement by the American Academy for the Advancement of Science](http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS_GM_statement.pdf) that addresses many of the common concerns. I'll quote: 

* In order to receive regulatory approval
in the United States, each
new GM crop must be subjected to
rigorous analysis and testing. It must
be shown to be the same as the parent
crop from which it was derived
and if a new protein trait has been
added, the protein must be shown
to be neither toxic nor allergenic.
As a result and contrary to popular
misconceptions, GM crops are the
most extensively tested crops ever
added to our food supply. 

* The World Health
Organization, the American Medical
Association, the U.S. National Academy
of Sciences, the British Royal
Society, and every other respected
organization that has examined the
evidence has come to the same
conclusion: consuming foods containing
ingredients derived from GM
crops is no riskier than consuming
the same foods containing ingredients
from crop plants modified by
conventional plant improvement
techniques.

&gt; We already know cancer, obesity, heart disease, autism, mental illness( especially anxiety and depression), and diabetes is a growing problem.

If you're implying that consuming GMO foods causes any of these diseases, then you're wrong. Science disagrees with you. A [widely-circulated paper](http://www.skepticalraptor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Seralini-Final-Paper.pdf) that claimed to show that GMO food caused health problems [has been debunked](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22287-study-linking-gm-crops-and-cancer-questioned/?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=online-news). But those who rely on making the public afraid to promote their own agenda aren't usually receptive to proof that disproves their claims.

Let me know if you need more proof /u/Londiebug13, there's a ton of research I could show you to demonstrate the safety of GMO foods.

predict-explain,"I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This is exactly why I think he's the right choice.

First, I think it means you get less backlash against the movement in general. If she were to interrupt another candidate, more people would use that as evidence against the BlackLivesMatter movement in general. That means more people would use the incident to negatively paint the entire BLM movement since they are less familiar with it, while the Sanders supporters who would be upset would be the least likely to do this.

Second, it forces Bernie to make a bigger deal out of racial injustice in his campaign. Even if he doesn't support the people who interrupt him, he has to at least issue some statement that says ""Why'd you pick on me? Here's everything I'm doing to help . . ."" and suddenly, it's a major part of his campaign.

Sanders *does* have a solid [page on racial injustice](https://berniesanders.com/issues/racial-justice) on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to [O'Malley's page](https://martinomalley.com/policy/criminal-justice/), Sanders has a lot of work to do. Interestingly enough, O'Malley began to better flush out his policy on criminal just after he was interrupted by BLM protesters.

Forcing his hand in making his stances on racial justice more public and more thorough is the best way to make it a bigger campaign issue, and is the best possible result for the BLM movement at large.

Sanders is the largest supporter of their movement currently running and they decided to attack his rally. This doesn't paint them in the best of light and marginalizes a lot of the things they are trying to say.

It would have served them better to attack another candidate with a much lesser position as it would do exactly what you said, force that issue to the front of their campaign. This doesn't work as well for Sanders because we know what his plans are and he has support for it, but this would have been great against Hillary or Trump as they haven't put much focus on the issue and their response to it could sway many people's opinions on their campaigns.","So, it's hard to actually know for sure how this will all play out. That's actually part of the reason this is bad - no one from any of the groups involved actually knows how this is going to affect his chances at a nomination, which means that at very least, this was reckless.

From a tactical point of view, their attack on one of their staunchest supporters potentially removes legitimacy from both them *and* him. If they were truly reasonable, why not just ask him to let them speak? If he was truly a supporter, then why would the group attack him? What else does he purport to support that he actually doesn't?

When people don't know his name well enough to instantly associate it with his views, attacks like this make it look like he doesn't support the things that he claims to. Without name recognition, a lot of people won't know that it's a double Shyamalan, and he actually does support civil rights.

It also makes him appear weak to the general public. Instead of standing firm, he's seen being bullied out by the very interests he supposedly serves. It's easy to say someone bows down to corporate interests or special interests, but it's far more visceral to actually *see* someone back down from a special interest group on a stage in front of a crowd.",B,B,"I believe Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a logical argument about how the Black Lives Matter movement attacking Bernie Sanders, one of their strongest supporters, may not have been the most strategic move. It suggests that attacking a candidate who has not focused on racial injustice issues would have been more effective in bringing attention to the cause. This argument may make the original poster reconsider their view on the effectiveness of the Black Lives Matter movement's actions. Reply B, on the other hand, focuses more on the potential negative consequences of the attack on Sanders without providing as strong of a reasoning for why it may not have been the best choice strategically."
predict-explain,"I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually rich white kids that already have a socioenconomic advantage. I was a regular upper-middle class guy who went to public school. I loved it. My school was great. We went on fun field trips, and even a trip to Europe. Homeschooling your kid is just insurance that he/she will be socially awkward, and disadvantaged. Lots of homeschooling involves religious indoctrination, and very one-sided opinions. In public school you are exposed to many different views, opinions, and types of people. These problems would be solved if everyone had to go to public school. Everyone would have an equal education, and equal opportunity.

If we hadn't been homeschooling then that would have meant changing school every 8 to 18 months. Many times these moves took place during the conventional school year, so homeschooling meant that we could keep up with our curriculum even though we we're moving to a different state while the normal school year was still in session.

predict-explain,"Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that it's become an incentive to do your job properly. I understand that it's the service that they provide and not just the food, but isn't that exactly what they're paid for? To give a paying customer a good service? Although I sympathize with their outrageously low wages, but why should I have to fork out more of my money that I'm already spending at a restaurant to subsidize young Jenny here, to get her up to normal living wage? Isn't that a governmental issue of poverty/low wages?","They are working for their wages, the only difference is that in some industries those wages come straight from the customer instead of the customer's money going to the business owner and then back to the employees. Tipping essentially cuts out the middle man, and allows you to directly pay the person providing you with a service instead of giving your money to the business, having the business take its cut, and then giving some of that money back to the employees. 

As for why you should have to, well, technically you don't (unless the restaurant/business includes a tip as a part of your bill). If tipping was eliminated then you would probably see an increase in the price of tipped services to make up for the increased wages of servers. In other words, your $10 cheeseburger might go up to $12 to make up for the 20% tip that people don't leave anymore. So instead of paying $10 with a $2 tip for that cheeseburger, you're paying $12 with no tip so the restaurant can pay its servers more than $3/hr. On top of that, the servers don't have as much of an incentive to provide top notch service since they'll be making the same amount regardless. You're drinks might take longer to get refilled, or your food might take longer to be brought to you. You're still paying the same amount, but now you're getting worse service.","Although you personally do not like tipping, the custom exists for good reason. If people did not tip and servers had to earn their living from only wages, food prices would increase to compensate the additional cost required to sustain the servers.  In addition to this, not tipping is typically frowned upon because the stiff is disregarding the server's humanity.

Eliminating the tip would not save money for anyone in the long run because restaurants will simply up the price of their food. Imagine a scenario in which one had to pay $10 + at least 20% tips, thus raising the price to $12. If tipping ceased, the restaurant would simply raise the initial price of the food to $12. The consumer still has to pay the same amount. However, under the tip system, servers can try to provide better service because they have an incentive for doing so. Tipping helps both the consumer and the server, and as such, it is more preferrable to tip than provide a base wage.

The server is paid a base wage of +/- $2/hour to ensure that they walk home with at least something. It's a protection of their income stability, much like how many salespeople of supermarkets like Walmart are paid much lower than what the skill demands because salespeople make commission. The base wage for a server is not meant to sustain the server. It is only meant to be used as a backup if income from tips is too low. Servers actually earn their money from providing and enhancing a good service by taking away plates and bringing food to the customer. Keep in mind that when consumers pay the price tag for the meal, they are paying only for the cook's labor and the cost of the ingredients. Tips are not factored in because they provide an incentive for servers to give giving a better service. While you may argue that cooks should be tipped too under this logic because then cooks have an incentive to cook better, the action is simply unrealistic to implement because a cook spends most of his or her time optimizing efficiency in the kitchen. To have to deal with tips is to immediately handicap the maximum achievement the cooks can accomplish.

People who serve are doing so to sustain their families. They try to provide the best service because they need something from you: money. A person who does not tip goves everyone else around him or her that he or she is rich, but chooses to spend cheaply anyway. It's a rude gesture, especially when someone else (the server) is expending a reasonable effort to provide the consumer with a better environment surrounding a meal. Tipping shows some respect to the server, which is arguably more important than saving $2 here and there. It's common knowledge that people didn't pay for the service up front and that stiffing the server results in making the server's life harder to live.",B,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a more thorough explanation of the reasons behind tipping, including how it benefits both the consumer and the server, as well as the potential consequences of eliminating tipping. It also addresses the importance of respect for the server and the impact of not tipping on their livelihood. Reply B also includes a comparison to other industries where tipping is not common practice, providing further context for the OP to consider. Overall, reply B provides a more comprehensive argument for the importance of tipping and is more likely to sway the OP's perspective on the matter."
predict-explain,"If a person with a minority background holds prejudiced views and acts according to them, that minority is being racist.

If racism is simply as you define then there is no discussion, you would be right.  Here are some points I would need cleared up before I can comment:

""The only factor at play when determining racism should be if someone is treating someone""- Can institutions and cultures be racist? Are they the ""someone"" in question? 
""because of their race or ethnicity""-How do you know when this criterion is met? Remember that behaviours are not necessarily reflective of the behaviour you're looking for. This seems to result in very few actual incidents of racism.
""race or ethnicity""- Is race is even a coherent concept? If it isn't then can someone be a racist if they don't believe in race? 

This is all connected to some central discussions in philosophy of race. There are many competing models of racism, each of which seems to be incomplete (at least to me), and there is a lack of general consensus.","&gt;The only factor at play when determining racism should be if someone is treating someone else worse because of their race or ethnicity.

Treating someone *better* because of their race is just as racist.

predict-explain,"Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: ""how does it come about that this right is inherent?""

What makes this right inherent?

There is a difference between rights granted  by law and natural rights. Laws can define where natural rights are legally applicable. But laws can't give or take away inherent/natural rights. (Laws can, however, violate or protect those rights.)

There still must be a logical derivation of this right from nature if it exists.

If ""Natural law derives from the nature of man and the world, just as physical law derives from the nature of space, time, and matter."" my question is, how exactly is it that you are proposing the right to firearms derives from nature?

""It just does"" is not a sufficient answer.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights

Explain why we have the natural right to self defense, and how, logically, that right extends to include firearm ownership. Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated.

I actually think guns are the least of our problems, and I'm not really a ""gun-grabber"" because there are a couple dozen things I'd rather do first. (And if those happen, guns would mostly only be used for hunting, and target practice. And the potential for a strong national defence, like they ought to be.) I'd rather get people educated and out of poverty. Etc. I tell you this so you can understand, I'm an open mind on this issue, and if you can't convince me, you probably won't convince anyone.

To be clear: I could give a **** about gun rights, I don't see any logical derivation of those rights from nature. So far as I can see they are only legal rights and not natural rights at all.

At the same time, people who actually spend effort and time opposing gun rights annoy me, because (duh) there will always be weapons and violence until people get healthy and free. focusing actions on a wedge issue like guns serves to divide, and sow fear, rather than to unify and bring progress. Discussion, though, is another matter.

I am currently against both ""gun grabbers"" (practically) and gun rights (ideologically). So I am mostly heavily neutral on this subject. I have serious questions about the central dogmas of both sides of this debate.

Tell me why I should no longer ideologically oppose gun rights. Show the logical derivation from nature, which I believe you are claiming exists. currently without an understanding of the justification for the claim that gun rights are natural rights, It is my view that many legal freedoms or impositions are a matter of practicality, justified by the basic and overriding human drive to form a safe, harmonious, and productive society, and then that guns are simply impractical toward this end.

if you can't convince me of this, (or at least correctly formulate _any_ argument defending your position) , you are probably not really going to convince anyone.

But If your thought is that the right to firearms is derived from the right to self defend would it not make more sense that the natural right to self defend justifies the legal right to live in a firearm free environment. Since guns take more lives than they save?

To claim that a right is derived from nature without showing the logic of the derivation is equally meaningless as to claim that a right is granted by God.

I see no logical derivation from nature for the right of humans to bear arms. (Bonus: I can't imagine that there is any which wouldn't also ""justify"" the ""rights of monkeys to bear arms"".)

I invite you to Change My View.","The whole concept of ""natural rights"" is, as Jeremy Bentham described  it, ""nonsense on stilts."" All of our legal rights are social constructs, no more and no less. The fact that they are social constructs does not make them any less meaningful or important. I don't really know why this reality is so discomforting to so many people. Perhaps it's because acknowledging this makes it clear that our rights *can* be taken away, and there is nothing ""above"" or ""beyond"" human society to safeguard them. But the facts are the facts, and while ""natural rights"" may be lofty rhetoric, the concept is ultimately a castle built made of sand.","I'll do my best with this.

&gt;Explain why we have the natural right to self defense, and how, logically, that right extends to include firearm ownership. Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated.

In the link you provided it's pretty clear that the right to live is a natural right. Well, if you are ever in a situation where your right to live is being threatened, how else are you going to defend that right? To me, logic dictates that the right to live and the right to self defense are mutually exclusive.

Now, if you accept my statements above then we can move to why gun rights are a natural right. It's best to use examples of self defense situations. 

Here's an example of situation people have and could face. I'm hanging out in my house and someone (or a couple people) breaks in and they have a baseball bat(s) or some other deadly objects. If it is my right to live and therefore my right to self defense then I should have the best means of self defense available to me. Now, just to be clear, the best means in general isn't the best means in all situations, just that it's going to be better suited for a variety of situations. This is where a gun comes in to the picture. 

I'm in my house that now has a stranger(s) that's armed with a weapon(s), what am I supposed to do? There is the intention to harm me and I have to choose how best to defend myself. I could grab a bat, a golf club, a knife, etc., but what's the likelihood of one of those options actually being viable in this situation? I would be going toe to toe with someone who could be bigger, stronger and more prepared. What are my chances of survival and hopefully being unharmed in this situation? 

Another option I could have is grabbing a gun, which is capable of dealing necessary force within a matter of seconds while potentially keeping some distance between me and that attacker. Now I have to ask the same question, what are my chances of survival and hopefully being unharmed in this situation? 

&gt;But If your thought is that the right to firearms is derived from the right to self defend would it not make more sense that the natural right to self defend justifies the legal right to live in a firearm free environment.

Here's the problem, if you take away firearms then there is no longer an equalizer for a whole variety of situations, just like the example I have presented. There is the potential that you will be in a situation where you are having to defend yourself from someone else that has a gun, but at least it would be a lot closer to a ""fair"" fight. Having a gun doesn't require much strength, size, agility, etc., but with things like a bat, knife and hammer, those attributes absolutely play a role. 

&gt;Since guns take more lives than they save?

There's isn't any proof that this is a fact. Since the number of defensive gun uses is a very hard statistic to gather, it is unknown if guns save more live or cost more lives. One thing you have to consider is if you get rid of guns, that doesn't inherently mean that those lives wouldn't have been lost by other means. If you look at countries like England and Australia, the total number of murders and crime was unaffected by their gun control measures. If you actually look at the crime and murder rates in those countries, those statistics actually increased the first couple years after their gun bans. They did eventually start to decrease, but the US has also steadily decreased in the same periods. Sure there is less gun related crimes in those countries, but crimes were just committed by other means.

If you feel like there is an important point of yours that I've messed, I can do my best to respond to that as well.",A,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in top movie list rankings. I am a westerner who has had exposure mainly to western film but also enjoys many other film types and cultures including Japanese and anime film.

However, I don't much care for Studio Ghibli stuff. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I don't like it. Except for Hisaishi's music, which I think is beautiful. I don't know why everyone seems to like these films so much. 

It bothers me as lots of my other views in life are congruent with the norm, or I can see why they vary.

I've watched lots of Ghibli films in order to give them a chance. I've already heard lots of people arguing that the artwork is great (and I do agree it is) and that's what makes the film great, but that doesn't cut it for me; the same people who argue in this way don't seem to apply that logic to the other films they watch and so must be adapting their viewing style for Ghibli or just repeating something they heard somewhere else, not responding as they normally would (perhaps with reference to direction, plot, acting, action, scripting, etc) when asked why they like a film.

Any comments or thoughts (outside of 'the artwork is so good') would be appreciated.","Ghibli films convey a feeling of sublime **wonder** unlike any other art or medium I have ever experienced. A large part of this is exploring the connection between humans and the environment/the world around them through the plot, themes and motifs, and *gorgeous* art.

In *Spirited Away* this is largely by incorporating spectacularly creative and colorful elements of Japanese Shinto mythology and fantastic scenes and characters. The landscapes and settings portrayed include a touch of steampunk, ""the bizarre"" reminiscent of Lewis Carroll and Alice in Wonderland, and scenes of intense tranquility. As the film follows Chihiro, we get to see some of the most brilliant scenes of both traveling and growing up. 

*Princess Mononoke* also presents the Shinto religious motifs and mixes them with the conflict of modernization and human industry/technology/feudalism - portraying environmental themes with a fantasy flair. The incredible strength of character displayed by Ashitaka, Eboshi, and San help carry this film, there is wonder and marvel at their badassness. Ashitaka is a beast.

*Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind* was an early pioneer of the apocalyptic wasteland setting. I hate bugs, but the way that the film portrayed the bugs in the movie was so endearing, startlingly innocent, and compassionate it is the only thing that has ever made me feel strongly emotional about bugs. It paints a bleak and haunting beautiful picture about war and devastation and survival in a wasteland all at the same time.

*Kiki's Delivery Service* is another slice of life with picturesque scenes and a touch of magic/witchcraft. The sense of wonder comes via scenes of flight whether by broom, dirigible, bird, or a ill-conceived propeller bike - flying over the charming scenes of urban life while following Kiki's journey of growing up in a new city.

In *My Neighbor Totoro*, the wonder is strongly tied to slice of life and compelling family themes. The young children encountering Totoro and the catbus as part of moving to their new home and how the fantastic adventure is interweaved with the real struggles of growing up, being raised by one parent while the other deals with illness, and sisterhood.

Studio Ghibli films are breathtakingly gorgeous, crafted for appreciation by children and adults, incorporate serious and meaningful themes, expertly portray the bildungsroman/coming-of-age story/character growth for both male and female protagonists alike, and conduct a sense of wonder in a way that no other piece of art or literature is able to do.","I'm unaware of many people who rate movies based on specific criteria outside of movie critics themselves. And even then, most are willing to accept that a movie can be a gestalt, a sum greater than its parts. And even then, critics also accept the visual and spectacle of a movie as being part of whether it's good. Your analysis (or expectation of how someone else would analyze a movie) is almost all technical, which does not speak to the quality of a movie and how it can actually affect people.

So, here are a few things usually part of why Ghibili movies are considered great which also apply to western movies.

1. Visuals. Especially in an era of nearly-realistic CGI, the sheer awe of a visually stunning movie are part of what make it good. When people put Jurassic Park on their lists of best movies, it is in part because of how gorgeous the visuals were. And how that creates the important sense of wonder that drives the rest of the film. See also Gravity. Or the Lord of the Rings, which was lauded in large part for looking the way that movie should look.

2. Characterization. None of the characters are evil for the sake of evil, or lack convictions which are (at the very least) understandable. The Noh isn't malicious, just misunderstood. Now think about how often bad action movies are slammed for lacking good characterization beyond ""gritty tough hero"" and ""bad guy for no apparent reason."" That scarecrow from Howl's moving castle has more characterization without *speaking* than Tony Stark has gotten in five movies.

3. Cohesive, character-driven, plots. Benefits of having good characters is that the plots are not macguffin-driven or rely on happenstance or sins of convenience for resolution. 

4. Acting. Yep, even animated characters can act. First, they're damned expressive as characters. Second, the voice acting is top-notch.

5. Stories, both relatable to the audience and unique. Yes, it takes a bit of suspension of disbelief to believe in the world of Spirited Away, but not much more than the suspension of disbelief for the Avengers. And once that's taken care of, the story itself is relatable. A young child who irresponsibly acts, and needs to fix it? That's old-school Spielberg at his best. A man who has acted selfishly is confronted with the need to consider others (and love) and risks himself to protect others? Yes, some of them are silly, but the ones people consider among the best movies are ones which resonate.

6. Emotional impact. This comes from the characters being fleshed out and relatable, but there are none but the most hard-hearted who don't tear up at the goddamned scarecrow in Howl's moving castle. That's a more significant emotional impact *without* having to resort to ham-handed tear-jerking.",A,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a detailed analysis of the themes, motifs, and artistry of Studio Ghibli films, highlighting the sense of wonder and emotional impact they evoke. It also compares different Ghibli films and their unique qualities, showcasing the depth and complexity of the storytelling. In contrast, reply B focuses more on technical aspects such as visuals, characterization, and plot, which may not resonate as strongly with someone who is seeking a deeper understanding of why these films are so highly regarded. Reply A delves into the emotional and thematic depth of Studio Ghibli films, which may help the original poster appreciate them in a new light."
predict-explain,"Before I begin, I would like to point something out. I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. ""That means that marriage isn't as special and you can just drop out freely whenever you want"". I don't see this as a viable argument, because if someone is going to leave, then they have a reason to. Even if its a bad reason, or a really good reason, making the person stay by the threat of losing lots of money and/or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse and cause the couple to fight more and more. 

I see no reason whatsoever why anyone should be able to take legal action if their spouse decides to leave then. If someone leaves a marriage, it means they are unhappy with it, or have lost feelings for the other person. And like I said in my first statement, making the person stay in marriage until a joint divorce is (if ever) made by the threat of the person leaving losing a lot of money and/or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse, leaving 1 or both of the people suffering for years. 

Another reason why this is bad is if one person is unhappy in their marriage, and the spouse is forcing them to stay by means of threatening legal action, will leave the unhappy spouse in a terrible marriage for years, or possibly for the rest of their lives.

&gt;&gt; If someone was going to just drop out, they should be the ones to figure shit out on their own.

You haven't accounted for the variety of reasons that lead to divorce. If one member leaves a marriage because their partner is abusive or violent, then it isn't an amicable or dispassionate end to the relationship. Don't you think that it's right for the victim to ask for any compensation?","There are many marriages where one spouse has given up his or her career to take care of children. In case of a divorce this person is now at a tremendous financial disadvantage because re-entering the workforce after several years can be difficult. Do you think it would be unfair if you were caught in such a situation without marketable skills?

Also let's say a couple has joint finances and are both working. Should the spouse pursuing the divorce not be entitled to his or her share of the money in the finances?

Additionally, decisions regarding custody of children can be difficult as well and can be considered punitive by some in the divorce process. An even split of custody isn't always a good outcome if one spouse is abusive. If one spouse intends to move, this would put unnecessary strain on children. All of these factors need to be considered in some way.

Ultimately, without such measures in divorce proceedings, a stay at home parent is at a disadvantage and financially will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce. This allows the other spouse to act in any manner he wishes, knowing his spouse will not leave him without great difficulty. Divorce proceeding should not be considered punitive, but should be considered the pursuit of the most just outcome for all parties involved (both spouses and the children). Your argument centers on the fact someone can be caught in an unhappy marriage for fear of losing money/children. But your solution doesn't solve this problem, someone caught in a relationship with an abusive or cheating spouse will have no recourse regarding custody of kids or financial compensation and therefore will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce.",A,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides specific examples and scenarios where legal action in divorce proceedings is necessary to ensure fairness and justice for all parties involved. It highlights the potential financial disadvantage that a stay-at-home parent may face, as well as the complexities of custody decisions and the impact on children. By addressing these specific concerns and demonstrating the potential consequences of not having legal protections in place, Reply B effectively challenges the original poster's argument and provides a more nuanced perspective on the issue."
predict-explain,"First of all, the *law* I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general.

Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. The rules don't tell you to give up your seat for her, but you do.

This short scenario illustrates that rules and morals are two different things. However, I see more and more people defending actions saying it was ""legal"", and therefore it should be alright. 

The death of Cecil the lion is an (extreme) example: the man who shot him defended himself by declaring that what he did was legal. As the global outrage over his actions showed us, it was however completely immoral.

Another example: bankers. I read in a book that bankers that are considered ""professional"" disregard their own morals as much as possible and instead try to do as much as is legally possible. Immoral bankers and brokers are a core part of why the 2008 crisis was able to happen.

I think this illustrates what happens when people use the law as ""moral compass"": immoral behavior. 

Secondly, I think this is caused by the fact that our law is not our morals themselves but rather these morals applied into (simplified) rules.

Thirdly, I think it's impossible to enforce socially appropriate behavior like giving up your bus seat. This follows from my second viewpoint: because rules are simplified results of our morals, they can never cover every aspect of our lives, therefore leaving gaps for bus travellers and dentists and bankers to exploit.

**I think it's up to us to be aware of this and never use the law as a moral compass. Please, change my view.**

As the global outrage over his actions showed us, it was however completely immoral.

Well, let's start here with the question of how you're defining ""moral"" or ""immoral.""  You seem to be adopting a kind of ""if enough people are vocally against it"" standard for this first part, but is that really your system of determining was is moral?

If so, how do you know the number of people who actually were okay with his actions and simply didn't say anything, and that the apparent overwhelming opposition was really just a smaller number of more outraged people?

Essentially, you seem to be treating volume of the voices for the number of voices.

So let's say 51% of the world population was okay with it (a silent majority, to be a bit hackneyed), would that mean his actions were moral?

On the other side, as recently as 2013 a majority of Americans opposed gay marriage, did that make gay people who did get married in that year immoral?

&gt;Another example: bankers. I read in a book that bankers that are considered ""professional"" disregard their own morals as much as possible and instead try to do as much as is legally possible. Immoral bankers and brokers are a core part of why the 2008 crisis was able to happen.

In most professions where one represents the interests of others there is an ethical obligation to do what is best for one's clients within the bounds of the law, rather than doing what you would consider morally best.  While also true of bankers this is exemplified in doctors or lawyers.

And how are you determining whether the bankers actually *did* act immorally?  You seem to be taking that for granted here, but other than ""there was a bad outcome"" have nothing indicating they actually acted immorally in their specific roles.

&gt;I think it's up to us to be aware of this and never use the law as a moral compass. Please, change my view.

Well, okay, but the dentist in your first example did believe he was acting morally (since otherwise he wouldn't have done it).  His argument that it was legal is not an argument that he felt it immoral but did it because it was legal, but rather that it was legal and so no one else can force their morality on to him.

Your argument doesn't seem to be ""we shouldn't use law as a moral compass"" (since the dentist probably *does* have a moral compass outside of law, but one which includes killing lions) but rather that anyone whose moral compass does not go above and beyond what the law requires is immoral purely by virtue of not being closer to your moral code.

What if my moral compass says ""I got this seat first, and I don't give a damn about that old lady""?  That's not using law as a moral compass, that's having a moral compass which does not require me to give up my seat and there not being a legal requirement to do so.

Which is really all a moral compass represents: what behaviors do I believe I should engage in, and what behaviors should I not engage in, within the bounds of the laws which I must abide by.  Which means neither the moral compass of ""let the old lady take my seat"" nor the moral compass of ""fuck her I don't want to stand"" is using the law as that compass.","You're examples all lean towards the side of someone doing something bad, and justifying it because it was legal. However, if the law shouldn't be your moral compss, then you have to look at it in the other light as well. What if people are doing things that the law considers bad, but they consider morally upright? Are they entitled to act on their own moral reasoning rather than the ones the elected officials of our nation have considered? If other people are influenced by your actions, should they really be controlled more by the whims of your own conscience than representative of our community? For example, let's say you think it's not morally reprehensible to kill a drug dealer because they impact many lives negatively through their occupation. Is it morally right for you to act on your own moral logic, disregarding entirely what your community's moral logic has asked of you? Isn't it best at times to acknowledge that while you may have a conflicting opinion, you are not a god and your personal beliefs may be secondary to the larger community's moral beliefs if it affects other people in your community?",A,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B raises a valid point about the potential consequences of individuals acting solely based on their own moral reasoning rather than considering the laws and moral standards of the community as a whole. By presenting a scenario where someone believes it is morally justified to kill a drug dealer, despite it being illegal, Reply B challenges the original poster to consider the implications of disregarding societal norms and laws in favor of personal moral beliefs. This argument encourages the original poster to think about the balance between personal morality and community standards, ultimately suggesting that there may be times when individual beliefs should take a backseat to the greater good of the community. 

In comparison, Reply A focuses more on questioning the original poster's definition of morality and providing counterarguments to the examples presented. While Reply A raises some valid points, it doesn't directly address the core issue of whether individuals should prioritize personal morality over legal standards. 

Overall, Reply B's argument is more likely to prompt the original poster to reconsider their view on using the law as a moral compass by highlighting the potential consequences of disregarding societal norms."

It totally sucks to feel like your body is completely wrong for you. If we could cure them with therapy or drugs, most of them would be happy to be cured of it. 

But we don't understand neuroscience well enough to develop a cure yet. Counselling does very little to make them feel better. So instead, we use surgery and hormone replacement therapy. It's not ideal, but it makes them feel a lot better. Unlike people with untreated anorexia, bulimia, and other serious mental disorders, they go on to live happy and productive lives. Since it works, why argue with it?

As for body integrity identity disorder (alien hand syndrome,) there isn't really enough scientific consensus to support a particular treatment. Amputation is permanent, and there is a risk that the patient will develop phantom limb syndrome, or another psychological fixation in it's place. Hopefully, doctors will develop a working cure for these patients in the near future too. But right now, it seems like psychological therapy is the best option.","This is a very common topic on [this sub] (https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3an3j3/cmv_i_believe_transgenderism_is_a_mental_illness/cse5qgp), so I'm just going to copy older responses to save time:  

&gt;I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning  

Here is an excerpt from a [textbook on neuro-biology explaining the modern scientific understanding of sex, gender, and gender identity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10943/):  

&gt;&gt;Gender refers more broadly to an individual's subjective perception of their sex and their sexual orientation, and is therefore harder to define than genotypic or phenotypic sex. Generally speaking, gender identity entails self-appraisal according to the traits most often associated with one sex or the other (called gender traits), and these can be influenced to some degree by cultural norms. Sexual orientation also entails self-appraisal in the context of culture. For purposes of understanding the neurobiology of sex, it is helpful to think of genotypic sex as largely immutable, phenotypic sex as modifiable (by developmental processes, hormone treatment, and/or surgery), and gender as a more complex construct that is determined culturally as well as biologically.

&gt;We, as a society, have decided that these are sick individuals who need medical and psychiatric attention. Certainly, an individual with alien hand syndrome could have a procedure to remove their hand in a safe and controlled environment and continue living a suitable life. We don't allow that, though. How is having gender identity issues different from afflictions I have described above?  

[Gender dysphoria is already classified as a mental illness under the DSM V.](http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf) 

&gt;Also, why are these individuals allowed to make unnecessary changes to their body when we don't provide the same liberties to others?  

Because it works. [Here is a comment with multiple citations](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2o02ul/cmv_i_think_transgenderism_is_a_mental_health/cmih4oh) that show current medical understanding of trans issues and the treatment options, especially showing how transition is effective. It also addresses your ""alien hand syndrome"" comment and why treating that isn't comparable to transgenderism.  

I'm reproducing the relevant parts below:  

&gt;&gt;Two, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.

&gt;&gt;Compare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to both [therapy and SSRIs.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/)  

&gt;&gt;Three, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, ""significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility."" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.  

&gt;&gt;This is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.

The linked comment addresses everything you've asked. You can also go to /r/asktransgender to talk to actual trans people. They've put together many links detailing this too.",B,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a thorough explanation of the modern scientific understanding of gender, gender dysphoria, and the treatment options available for transgender individuals. It also addresses the comparison made by the original poster between gender identity issues and other afflictions like alien hand syndrome and body integrity identity disorder, explaining why they are not directly comparable. Additionally, Reply B includes multiple citations and studies that show the effectiveness of transitioning for transgender individuals and how it leads to significant improvements in their mental health and overall well-being.

Overall, Reply B provides a well-reasoned and evidence-based argument that directly addresses the concerns raised by the original poster, making it more likely to change their view on the topic."
predict-explain,"I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites and collect leads for the marketers (which is probably me favorite part of the job). It feels really fulfilling to me to make something (a bot) that does what a person couldn't do in a month's full time work. That, and it feels rewarding knowing I gathered something(s) with immediate marketable value. That, and that, and the idea of all of the potential uses and benefits to having this information. 

I've been to a lot of hackathons (programming-marathons) and open-data is an awesome opportunity to make something cool and resume-building quickly (hackathons are usually only 24-48 hours overnight). The more data out there, the more possibilities there are to help the public or invent something novel.  

I think of the government the same way, if the data they collect and use helps their ability to govern then I am all for it.  

And on a personal level, I don't care that whoever is tracking my phone, reading my emails, whatever. I'm just glad someone is using my information to make my life and the lives of others to be better.  

Edit: you guys got me  
-If the NSA collected less information, it could be more useful and usable.    
-Your Emails, much like music or physical letters, *should* be your own private property, even if they aren't now  
-I can't both agree that the NSA should collect this information and the NSA should do this legally, because they are collecting it illegally it is a logical fallacy  
-By agree to this, I take away other people's privacy rights, and that's not okay  
-There could be new data or ways of analyzing it that would more seriously violate privacy or give power, and this is setting a bad precedent  
-Mass surveillance is bad historically

If one could be certain that this is *solely* how the data would be used, then yes, I'd be in favor it it too, but that isn't how power works.  At least, that's not how it's ever worked throughout human history ... maybe this time will be different?  Right.

It is also arguably illegal.  So even if we wanted to do this, we'd potentially have to amend the constitution to grant the government this power.

Aside from abuse, there's also the fact that these data storage systems cannot be secured.  Note the recent hack of data regarding everyone that's ever had a security clearance background check.

While I have not been directly investigated for security clearance, my name is in at least 4 security clearance files as a 'relation' some some kind.  I'm not really happy about that now, and have no confidence that the government's ability to execute such surveillance securely is competent.

&gt;  I'm just glad someone is using my information to make my life and the lives of others to be better.

This is very specifically the job of the Census folks, not the NSA, and plenty of people don't even trust them either.","As a fellow programmer, I completely disagree with you. The fact that you understand just how powerful the tools are becoming to gather and analyze data on such a massive scale should give you a pause. Yes, if used for good, it can improve a lot of stuff. But just like any super powerful thing, if used badly it can cause shitloads of damage.

The same bots and analytical tools for determining something in marketing can and most importantly ARE being used for nefarious purposes - like discovering and stopping political dissent for example. You should never trust that your government will always do good. Take a look at any history book of any country (including yours). What you will find is that again and again governments are doing shitty things and abusing their power.

You are trusting the same institution that tried to get MLK to kill himself by threatening they will expose his affairs. For what? Because he wanted rights for black people. Well, what happens when when the new MLK is born tomorrow and the government has all these powerful tools to gather all the dirt they want on them, to figure out who the supporters are and so on?

Let's assume the government at the moment is not like that and are honestly doing only good with the info (which as revealed by whistleblowers is not true, but lets entertain the thought). Can you then guarantee all future governments will be so good too? Because once you give your government such powers, it's very hard to take them back. So what happens a decade or two down the line, when a bunch of assholes are in power?

To support this you need not only believe the current government do not abuse the power (which is a bit naive) but that future governments will not abuse the powers either (which is quite frankly nearly impossible).

And for what? The number of people dying in terrorist plots is minuscule, even in 3rd world countries. If you want to save human lives at the cost of freedom so much, you'll be better off attacking the big problems, like obesity for example.",B,A,"I would say that reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

Reply B also brings up the importance of considering the balance between security and freedom, and suggests that there are more pressing issues that could be addressed to save lives without sacrificing privacy. Overall, reply B presents a more thorough and compelling argument against the original poster's viewpoint."
predict-explain,"The reason I say this is because making those words forbidden only adds to their power, meaning that when they are used it is that much more effective. By using them in a casual way (not as an insult, but in a way similar to how people used to say ""that's so gay"") we send the message that it really isn't a big deal, which allows the word to slowly fade away from its original meaning to the point that it doesn't really have anything to do with what it once did.


The main thing that I draw from for this view is the word cunt. This is a pretty common insult where I used to live, though not as much in the U.S.; it basically just means jerk, and calling someone a cunt has little to do with female genitalia. If we manage to do this with words like nigger than it doesn't have to be associated with the thing it was originally connected with; in other words, it's just a generic insult that doesn't necessarily have to be associated with that group, like the word ""jerk"". 


This isn't a view that I strongly hold, and I am fairly open to it being changed and look forward to hearing what all of you have to say in this matter. Thank you in advance to everyone who posts.

Saying a word is just uttering it. Using a word is, in the case of slurs, throwing it at people. 

Saying slurs for the purpose of discussing their oppressive backgrounds, their history, as part of a story or whatever else is absolutely fine, because its use in that context is not a form of oppression.

Using slurs, as in saying this words to imply negative connotation or to harass people is unacceptable. Slurs are verbal weapons, and while continued use may lessen the impact, it normalizes the idea that the target of this slur bears x qualities (usually negative ""I look like a dyke today"" ""I smell like a nigger"") This hurts the targets of these slurs, even if they're not there to hear it, by perpetuating harmful stereotypes.

Also as a gay guy who was bullied, having someone like a friend use ""faggot"" to describe someone or ""faggoty"" to describe something (again, generally to put it down) really upsets me, just how people can't bear to see knives or scissors after being attacked with one, It's hard for me to hear the word after being attacked with one, so I politely tell my friends to please tone down the slurs.

The difference here is that ""cunt"" per se targets no real demographic at this point, mainly because cunt was not a word for a person but a word for genitalia, while the other slurs you mention do target people in current memory.","Just out of curiosity, do you happen to be a lesbian, other flavor of LBGT, or black?

It amuses me when I hear lots straight people *insisting* that their use of the word faggot or gay couldn't possibly be offensive because it wasn't directed at me and wasn't intended to put me down. It never seems to occur to them that their frame of reference simply can't predict what will and won't be hurtful, or that the solution ""let's just use it a lot so that you become numb to the original meaning"" isn't a good solution.

I suppose that comes off as condescending. I really shouldn't do that, but this sort of thinking frustrates me. I'm a believer in descriptivist linguistics, so I understand the argument, but this is a different ball game. I could go on about normalization, discrimination and so forth, but I'd rather just talk about outcomes.

If you had asked me in the mid 2000's, when faggot and gay were really in prime use, I would have told you that it didn't really bother me. I had in fact become numb to their use. Now in 2015, it's slightly rarer to even see people saying ""that's so gay"", I can honestly say this state of language is 100% preferable to earlier. I feel better about myself, and interacting online. Becoming numb to faggot and gay wasn't a *solution*, it was a *coping mechanism*.

Despite what you think, when you use those terms, *you make people feel unwanted,* not to go all Tumblr on you, but when you can reduce your negative impact on the world by such a simple act as not using obviously offensive words like Faggot or Nigger you should feel an obligation to do so.

By all means, in your close group of friends where there's no faggots or niggers to casually make feel unwanted, go nuts. Use whatever terms you like. But anywhere else, maybe be a decent person and restrain yourself a little.",B,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides a clear distinction between saying a word and using a word, emphasizing the impact of using slurs on perpetuating harmful stereotypes and hurting individuals. The user also shares a personal experience as a gay individual who was bullied, making the argument more relatable and emotionally impactful. Additionally, Reply A acknowledges the difference in impact between using a word like ""cunt"" versus using more targeted slurs like ""faggot"" or ""nigger"", which adds nuance to the argument. Overall, Reply A presents a more thoughtful and empathetic perspective that is likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially change their view."
predict-explain,"I have come to this conclusion for several reasons.
*The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience alone it is the country most likely to use them again.

*The main positive effect of atomic weapons, that gets brought up a lot , is mutually assured destruction. The USA dropped 2 atomic bombs, not as retribution to an atomic attack. It demonstrated a lower bar for considering using them.

*The USA regularly starts new wars. It's certainly the nation among the big superpowers that is most likely to initiate a new war and, in the case of Irak, can not even explain why they went to war in the first place. A country that is this likely to be involved in wars is more likely to find itself in a position where it would consider using another atomic bomb.

The US has the military power to bomb any other nation into rubble, without resorting to nuclear power. Sure, the US is more likely to engage in military conflict that many other nations, but nukes are also very far down on the US' list of options.

The US showed a willingness to destroy two cities in a war that had already destroyed many more.  

The nuclear weapons of today have far more destructive power, so even a unilateral attack would cause far more damage.  And of course any attack by the US would unlikely be unilateral.  

The fact that a nation destroyed two cities in wartime 70 years ago really have nothing to do with predicting how likely that same nation is to inflict mass destruction all over the world today.",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all. There are other sources of information that help us grow much better.

If that is so, what is the point of fiction apart from a source of entertainment that may or may not help us in the long run? If all it does is provide short-term joy, what is the point of it?

Is our time not better spent trying to grow ourselves?   
Why waste our time trying to entertain ourselves when we could just use other forms of relaxation between sessions of growing ourselves? Is that not the goal of life? To improve and advance our lives and those of others?

Or am I wrong? Is fiction truly of some use? Or if it isn't of any use, then should we still consume it? If so, why? Why not simply just exercise, meditate or sleep instead of reading fiction? What makes fiction a better alternative to those activities?","**Knowledge**

* Fiction can inspire interest and further reading / investigation into a particular topic - science, historical events, social issues, different cultures/societies, technologies.

* Fiction can allow one to empathize with different perspectives they would have not previously considered or found difficult to wrap their head around. 

* It can assist one to observe and understand the complexity of human emotions and relations.

* In many science studies, they will get the test subjects to consume fiction while they scan their brains to observe how they respond to certain stimuli that would otherwise be unsafe/hard to find within the immediate vicinity = increased understanding of how our noggins work = better medications, better health policies, more effectively directed funding in health industry = overall healthier population... eventually.

**Health**

* Many people cite fiction - music, video games, watching films/tv series, etc as a mental escape that helps them unwind at the end of the day and calm down. 
There is ample info out there that details the negative effects pent up frustration and stress can have on both your mental and physical state.

* It can inspire other people to create their own fiction - music/art/film/write which is also a good stress-reliever.

* Refer to last point under **Knowledge**

**Career Progress/Social life**
 
* Consuming fiction can inspire one to take up creating it themselves and some make a career out of it. Movie stars/directors, artists and musicians didn't decide to be those things in a vacuum. I think you'll find most were inspired by consuming fiction beforehand.

* Many people will be inclined, after consumption, to take it up as a hobby = join community groups/forums, take classes etc = new friends - if you don't think making new friends can help one grow as an individual then I don't know what will. 

Edit: miswording","To each their own, but the 'life' you propose doesn't seem worth living, and I'm an educated person who does spend a lot of time reading non-fiction and watching docos. Should people take an active interest in bettering themselves physically and mentally?

predict-explain,"I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a 'joke' as angry liberals make it seem.

What I'm trying to say, is that people should not be forced into believing and supporting gay marriage, gay/lesbian/transgender/pansexual and all that—they should be allowed to express their freedom of religion without the oppression of liberalism the way they expect not to be oppressed by conservatism. Seems very hypocritical, no?

The point here, is that staunch liberals have a very high tendency to be hypocritical towards religion, but get really offended when a conservative does the same towards them.

It all makes no sense to me, and I want to be open to changing my belief about this one way or the other. It's a big mess that aggravates me, because no one on the far sides of the spectrum sticks to their word very well. I'm a libertarian, so I have my likes and dislikes toward each side, and I would like to understand these specific viewpoints better.

EDIT: This blew up a lot more than I thought it would, which is good. I got a lot of clarification, and I've awarded some &amp;#8710;'s. To be more specific (if you're trying to step in my shoes), I USED to be a devout Catholic, until I thought some of the teachings were immoral and 'behind the times.' I just don't think that religion is a bunch of crap as some make it out to seem; however, since my view has been changed, I believe that as people should have freedom of religion, that freedom of religion can only go so far before it becomes a legal issue. I believe that freedom of religion already has a more bigoted starting point than the opposite viewpoint which is more 'realistic' shall I say.","I assume the following points are correct:

you are not religious 

OR you do not favor your religious freedom above others.

Here is my argument:
It is a debate between understanding of freedom. Does religious freedom stand above any other freedom? Very few people would say that. If I had a religion that said the everyone should touch a statue of Lenin everyday, could I then use my religious freedom to force that? Again very few people would say that.
Therefore I should never have 100 % religious freedom according to any sane person, nor is religious freedom an on/off switch.
Because of that, I should be a discussion on how long one's religious freedom should stretch. 

I believe that a persons religious freedom determines that one can choose to live by religious rules, but not be able to force others to do the same. Then one would prevent others of having their religious freedom.

To put it into a cliché:
You can do anything as long as you do not prevent others of doing the same.","Ok freedom of religion does not entail a number of things, first and foremost, you are free to practice your religion and others are free to criticize you or yes make fun of you for it (which makes them assholes, yes, but they are free to do so, just as you are free to mock non-religious people)

Second, denying a service of public accommodation to someone on the basis of religion is not allowed. This does not constitute an act of oppression.

In which ways are religious people being oppressed by liberalism?",A,B,"I believe reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a logical argument that challenges the original poster's belief that religious freedom should not be limited. It presents a scenario that highlights the potential consequences of unrestricted religious freedom and emphasizes the importance of considering the impact on others. Reply A also suggests that a discussion on the limits of religious freedom is necessary, which encourages the original poster to consider a more nuanced perspective on the issue. Overall, reply A offers a compelling argument that may prompt the original poster to reconsider their stance on the topic."
predict-explain,"Theft: copying something can't possibly be theft because theft requires taking something away and copying doesn't do that. 

Economic efficiency / average happiness: violating the individual rights to be unharmed and to not have property taken without permission (e.g. fines) while *pursuing* higher average happiness is immoral and impractical. For the plan to work, one would have to show that average happiness would increase and that the oppression inherent in the prohibition on commercial copying (taking into account the nature of the organization required to enforce that prohibition) would not outweigh the benefits; a calculation that seems to me impossible to make. What we do know for sure, if a prohibition on commercial copying is implemented, is that individual rights will be violated. 

Homesteading ideas / ownership extends to what we create: I have no problem with people owning their ideas. I don't suggest that they be extracted from their brain or deleted from their computer. Copying adds more of an idea, it doesn't take it away from its owner.

[It's basically a propaganda term that has become popular only recently, and covers very different sets of laws: copyright, patents, and trademarks.](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml)

So maybe you can be more clear. Do you for instance have any problem with trademark laws? Should someone be able to make shoes and slap the name Nike on them? Do you have a problem with patents, like every shoe company not being able to instantly use some new material/configuration introduced with a new Nike product? Or is your CMV simply about copyright, and may be rewritten like 'Copyright violation is not theft'?","&gt;Theft: copying something can't possibly be theft because theft requires taking something away and copying doesn't do that.

Thinking about IP violations as theft (defined as depriving someone of their rightfully owned property) is, in my mind, a wrong way to go about it. Ownership of something doesn't just mean you have possession of it, but that you have the right to *control its use.* We talk about violations of IP as ""theft"" when in reality, it is closer to a violation of the right to control the property. 

So if a person has a patent on a widget, he has the right to license and control the use of that widget. If he doesn't think it should be used in, say, weapons manufacturing- he has the right to deny the use of his IP in that field. 

Now say that a weapons company ignores this and uses the widget anyway. He has been wronged in two senses: first by loss of profits from the use of his widget (wherein the thing stolen is the *profit*, not the widget itself). Second, in the *control of the use* of the widget. The weapons manufacturer didn't deprive the inventor of *possession,* but he did deprive the inventor of *control.* 

So while it may not be theft of the property (on your definition of theft), it *is still a violation of property rights.*

Edit- To the economic utility point: I'm not sure I get your point. The argument in favor of IP is that IP will not be developed without protection for use and profit. This seems clearly correct: say a corporation could steal any patent from any inventor and deprive the inventor of profit or control without fear of reprimand. What incentive would the inventor have to devote time to inventing? What incentive would any person have to do research, when they would not be able to profit from the research.

&gt;What we do know for sure, if a prohibition on commercial copying is implemented, is that individual rights will be violated.

How?",B,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a clear explanation of why intellectual property rights are important, focusing on the idea of control over the use of property rather than just possession. By highlighting the importance of control and the potential loss of profits and incentives for innovation without IP protection, Reply B effectively argues for the necessity of intellectual property rights. 

In contrast, Reply A focuses more on the semantics of whether intellectual property is truly property or not, which may not directly address the original poster's concerns about theft and individual rights. 

Overall, Reply B provides a more compelling argument for the protection of intellectual property rights and is more likely to change the original poster's view on the subject."
predict-explain,"I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a ""slut"" the poster gets railed for it. I also don't think it is strictly the language being used. Regardless of the label, not wanting your partner to have been with 5+ people is 100% defensible. If we, as a society, can tell people that being tall is attractive or that being fat is unattractive, we can tell being that sleeping around is unattractive.     

Another logically invalid argument is that the person with the preference, must not be promiscuous themselves. I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he's hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner's choice in me, we can like different things. Many physically fit men are ""chubby-chasers"" and man slutty men are virginal chasers. 


Edit: To clarify, the use of the words ""slut"" earlier was merely a reflection of the term as it has been used on Reddit. I do not view a persons' worth as tied to their sexual history. I also don't have an moral qualms towards premarital sex or number of sexual partners. That said, my personal level of attraction is affected.

""Slut"" is a word with that kind of judgment/criticism built in, and when people are called out for acknowledging a woman's promiscuity, it is usually because they are being critical.

predict-explain,"My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in the wild is ""xe/xer/xerself"" or ""zi/zis/zimself"". My argument is as follows:

1. Pronouns are always dealing with a spectrum. A ""he"" can be used to describe both masculine as well as feminine men and similarly for she and women. The singular they is also covering a spectrum, the spectrum of all people that do not identify with either gender or those that identify with both to differing degrees. Therefore they is sufficient to describe alternative gender identities.
2. If we'd decide that new pronouns are necessary to describe or be inclusive to specific non-standard gender identities, we would very likely end up with a sheer infinite amount of pronouns. Since the argument for further pronouns would not be based on scientific facts but rather on feelings of individual people, the argument why some new pronouns are okay and others aren't would be a very difficult one to make. The result would be that we would have to allow anyone to pick or create their own pronouns.
3. Since we'd have a large number of new pronouns people would very likely get confused, since they'd not only have to remember a name and a face but also the specific pronouns of a person AND incorporate those into everyday speech. The result would either be that people would start inadvertently giving offence or our speech patterns would change to rely far more on using names instead of pronouns. 
4. Having a wide range of new pronouns would actively harm the English language by making it less clear. Encountering unknown pronouns would confuse people and make it difficult to imagine what kind of character is being talked about.

After all, ""they"" already basically fills this role, but some argue this is incorrect, and even if correct it is potentially confusing because that word can also be used as a plural pronoun. Simply replace ""they"" with ""whateverthefuckyouwant"" and all those problems are avoided.

Personally, I think gender-neutral singular ""they"" is perfectly fine, and trying to forcibly shoe-horn in another pronoun is pretty doomed to failure, because language isn't really a top-down process like that, but much more organic. But if it did happen slowly over time because people wanted a more unambiguous gender-neutral third person singular, it could happen without causing problems.","So...  I'm your target demographic here.  I'm MtF trans, but identify as non-binary.  I don't need a specific pronoun to describe my particular place on the gender spectrum; I'd agree that would be ridiculous--not because non-standard gender identities are ridiculous, but simply because of the way language works (that the meaning of a word must be known by both parties ub advance for a word to be useful in itself).  HOWEVER...

It would be nice to have a _singular_ gender-neutral pronoun instead of ""they.""  They is linguistically awkward because it's plural.  When I first came out, I decided to ask people to just use _she_, and one of the reasons for this is because there is no singular gender-neutral pronoun.  I agree that the proliferation of them is a problem, for me because it makes the adoption of one that's actually useful from a language perspective less likely.

I agree it's quite unlikely in the short term because we haven't settled on ___ONE___ of xe/ze/hir/etc... to describe non-binary gender identities.

My friend showed me [this article](http://time.com/3605606/ferguson-in-defense-of-rioting/) in defense of her argument. I'll quote from the conclusion,

&gt;Instead of tearing down other human beings who are acting upon decades of pent-up anger at a system decidedly against them, a system that has told them they are less than human for years, we ought to be reaching out to help them regain the humanity they lost, not when a few set fire to the buildings in Ferguson, but when they were born the wrong color in the post-racial America.

In response to the article, I essentially argued that while I do feel for minorities in the U.S, violence is neither a morally sound or pragmatic way to go about change. I also felt that the argument presented (we are not minorities, therefore we will never be able to understand, therefore we cannot criticize) is fundamentally unsound.

I'd love to hear some support for her viewpoint, because I am an open-minded person and I care about racial equality America

I have to protest that first off. Why would a white person be unable to understand what it means to be a minority? White people have been a minority in the global sense for years. There are also many white people who live in majority non-white places.

Even if you just mean ""the United States"", I still think a bit farfetched to think that people are wholly unable to understand the experiences of other people. It's just as demeaning to say a white person can't imagine being a minority as much as it is to say ""a black person can't imagine being a majority"".","Civil disobedience has long been a tool used to gain awareness and acceptance of movements in the United States.  From our forefathers throwing tea into the Boston harbor to Rosa Parks refusing to give up her bus seat, people who have wanted to enact change have accepted that non-violent protest - even when in violation of the law - is sometimes required.

So long as the people who violate those laws are willing to suffer the consequences of that violation in exchange for the benefit that those violations may bring, then it is a tool in the toolbox for those who want change.",B,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a historical context for civil disobedience and non-violent protest as a means to enact change. By referencing examples such as the Boston Tea Party and Rosa Parks, it shows that breaking the law in pursuit of justice is not a new concept and has been effective in the past. The reply also emphasizes the importance of being willing to face the consequences of breaking the law in exchange for the potential benefits it may bring, highlighting the commitment and sacrifice involved in such actions.

On the other hand, while Reply A challenges the idea that white people cannot understand the experiences of minorities, it does not directly address the issue of civil disobedience and whether it can be justified in certain circumstances. It focuses more on the ability to empathize with others rather than the effectiveness or legitimacy of certain forms of protest.

Overall, Reply B provides a more compelling argument by presenting a historical perspective and emphasizing the importance of civil disobedience as a tool for social change."
predict-explain,"First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea.
However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from people's discomfort with their own nonconformity and outlying ideas more than from a thirst for truth.

Additional info: I am currently writing an essay on the phenomenon of 'groupthink' so the theme is ripe in my mind.
I showed this sub to a friend of mine who immediately believes the moral statuses quo of Tumblr, including contradicting ideas, and has always seemed to me to have difficulty breaking social norms and thinking for herself. Her immediate reaction was to dismiss all posts she saw as 'stupid' (that'd be the first page of 'hot' at time of posting). This, no doubt, has influenced my view.

I'd like to highlight again that I am excited to have found this sub and I'll be visiting here often. But I'd like to discuss this idea first.

P.S. I'm so meta I post requests for people to change my view about /r/changemyview on /r/changemyview as a critique of /r/changemyview.

If a controversial point does not stand a test of logic or evidence, then the change of view has nothing to do with learning how to group think.",A,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B provides a more nuanced and logical argument about the nature of groupthink and the importance of examining arguments based on logic and evidence rather than simply dismissing them because they may be influenced by groupthink. Reply B encourages critical thinking and evaluation of arguments based on their merit, which aligns more closely with the original poster's concerns about nonconformity and outlying ideas. Additionally, Reply B acknowledges the potential flaws in groupthink but emphasizes the importance of focusing on the validity of the argument itself."
predict-explain,"They've been saying this since the 30s. Keynes predicted that as technology increased and our material needs would be met, we would only need to work 15 hours a week, instead we are working longer hours than ever.

People were saying from the 18th Century that the industrial revolution will make man redundant? But did it? People moved on, new types of job openings which we'd never have imagined before came to be, think about the luddites' opposition to technology. We do not have anything to fear.","This is kind of an aside: 


I think both sides of this argument are missing the point here (and I do agree with points on both sides). While I do think that it is possible for automation to replace the lion's share of modern jobs (I just watched a lecture yesterday where it was claimed that only ~20% of factory jobs were lost overseas whereas they discovered in retrospect that almost ~80% were lost due to automation), I also think economists opposing this view have a good point when they say that we can create new jobs, ones that we can't even imagine today, to keep the majority of people employed to the same degree as today.


That said, I think there are two *very important* factors missing from this discussion: 


1) The inherent value of a newly created jobs compared to past jobs, and

2) Our economic system's ability to accommodate accelerating technological change in terms of employment


Regarding the first point, people tend to become disillusioned about work on a psychological level when they feel that their work isn't adding any value. That was one of Marx's core critiques about Capitalism when he argued how essential it was for the workers to control the means of production. The less valuable/necessary people percieve their jobs, regardless of how well compensated they are for it, the less satisfied they will be with their lives. I recently read an article about how the vast majority of people in cities like London, a place where many people (office drones) are employed in information industries doing jobs that didn't exist ten to fifteen years ago, feel that their jobs are utterly meaningless in the grand scheme of things (and they're not wrong) and many subsequently feel depressed.


London is an extreme example but rest assured, with increasing automation, most other places will start to catch up. Information and information-based services will be (already is) the most important product that we produce, not physical goods/labour. This means is that the work we do as humans is becoming more work for the sake of work. A century ago, the majority of work that we did were things that quite obviously needed to be done. We repaired things, we built things, we provided crucial services, and so on. Think about ten people around you today and ask yourself: do the jobs they do create a net benefit for their lives and the lives of people around them, or are their jobs essentially bullshit?


You'd be surprised at how many jobs today add little to no value. Even if they do add some value, it's often not (nearly) enough to rationalize it taking up 40+ hours of someone's life each week. This trend is only going to get worse, too, as more and more ""critical"" jobs are automated/rendered obsolete and more and more bullshit jobs get added to the pool. It's no wonder that people are miserable: we've seen a kind of spiritual decay where the vast majority of people have become miserable in their employment and that it's only going to get worse until we decide enough is enough and no longer require people to work in order to provide for themselves. This is all exacerbated by the fact that we're collectively more educated and aware than we've ever been, and that we all know the most surefire way to become wealthy is to game the system (like on Wall Street), not create value for others.


As per the second point, say you disagree with my first point and want to argue that the value of new jobs being added to the economy is worthwhile enough to continue to employ the majority of people in new jobs. Fair enough. The other problem with this is that a lot of the jobs being added don't fit into the employment model of the past century. It's becoming harder and harder for companies to justify hiring people full time, putting them all in an office and making them sit in cubicles for 40+ hours per week. Just look at the business models of Uber, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram and so on: these companies are indicative of a 21st century employment model. They are not traditional vertically integrated companies that need to hire tens of thousands of people in order to function, instead they get by on hiring a handful of people and providing a service to more than a billion people. Traditional vertically integrated companies are learning from this as well and reducing the number of employees they have (when they can get away with it). 


Thanks to the internet and accelerating technological change, these 21st century business models are scalable in a way that traditional business models weren't. A lot of the information-based services and distribution models around them that needed to exist last century are totally irrelevant now and are in the middle of a mass extinction. That's why we've been hearing the death rattle from the MPAA and many other large ""information brokers"": they're irrelevant and they're flailing wildly trying to find a way to prop up the old business model just so they can survive (while making everyone hate them in the process). We don't need a middle man anymore, the software is the middle man with algorithms replacing humans as gatekeepers to 1s and 0s. 


So regardless of what you think about automation and job creation, you can't dodge the fact that our current employment models no longer make sense. The world is full of offices that exist for the sake of tradition (and supposed information security) where the majority of people sit at their desks doing valueless busy work and surfing the internet every chance they get. That's why we're seeing a huge boom in freelancing. A (regulated) Uber-style employment is likely going to be the new employment model for the next few decades. Companies are going to want to hire freelancers (from anywhere in the world), have them sign NDAs, produce X amount of work for them and those freelancers might do work for 2-3 companies at the same time.


Blue collar work is no exception. Companies like McDonalds are slowly and carefully revealing to the world that they intend to phase out many of their workers in the coming years, something I expect will be accelerated by minimum wage increases. Retailers, large and small, are beginning to becoming nothing more than glorified show rooms and many are losing the battle against online shopping. Jobs in the transportation industry (taxis, trucking etc) see the writing on the wall. ""Sharing economy"" services like AirBnB and Uber will continue to have an impact. Services like Instagram and smartphone cameras killed vertically integrated behemoths like Kodak. The list goes on.


Anyway, even if you think that automation is going to displace rather than replace people, I think you still need to concede that replacement is possible if we allow it, and that there are good arguments for replacement over creating jobs for the sake of creating jobs. First and foremost, unless we do something radical (like basic income) a lot of people (especially those not educated or business/tech savvy) are going to fall in the cracks opened up by accelerating change (like anyone who works in the transportation industry today). 

I also think there is another, even better argument for allowing ourselves to drop out of the labour market if we want to, and that argument is an environmental one: we overproduce and overconsume more than any other point in history, it is unsustainable and that we need to start producing and consuming less and therefore we need to start thinking up a new way to organize economic activity around the concept of sustainability.

**Late edit**: added tl;dr

**Tl;dr** 

- Basic human needs are finite and can be totally satisfied with automation in the foreseeable future
- Current levels of automation have already displaced humans away from work that has obvious value
- New jobs have increasingly less value than before when they are created in spaces where they can't be automated (yet) and thus job satisfaction is on the decline
- Many new jobs are created for the sake of creating jobs (a symptom of past bureaucracies / legislation / remaining inertia from 20th century employment practices)
- We increasingly overproduce and over consume because of our economic model and increased efficiency over time
- The employment system is shifting from full time to part time freelancing type employment, which can be inhumane without the proper framework in place (basic income) 
- We need to change our antiquated view of work where we think every able bodied person should work to one where we see work as optional and less centralized 
- We need to think of a new economic system or else things will start getting ugly and this is true regardless of whether you think future automation will displace or replace humans","I'm getting a PhD in this now.  Over the next 20 years things will get crazy.  To look over the horizon, there's a few technologies that are just now coming together.

 * Cheap Sensors: 6 years ago I wanted to make an RC Segway.  I started on it, but you either had to hand build a sensor from cheaper ones or buy one pre-made for $600.  Now, those sensors are $2 a piece and come in cell phones.

 * Computing Power: For things like automatic cars you need a lot of fast processing power because you can't wait 5 seconds to figure out if you're about to crash.  Right now, things are just getting to the level where a $500 or so computer can do enough calculations to have something workable.

Those 2 things will make a lot of people redundant.  It might be the biggest change society has ever experienced.  Robots building robots, driving everyone around and doing everything for us.  It'll change politics and how people view living life, but we'll have so much stuff it might be a lot better.

For the fear part, this changes war completely.  I think robotics is a WMD worse than atomic bombs.  Its hard to make atomic bombs, and countries can monitor each other, but anyone can download a program from the internet, load it into a robot, and turn it into an indiscriminate killing machine.

If you check out a video of a high powered quadcopter, then look at another of tricks people can make them do, the technology exists today for a small government or large group of people to make killing machines that could wipe out a city.  Right now, a country with a cell phone factory could convert it to make sniper drones by the thousands.  The only reason you we see it now is because governments like the US and China are more interested in technology that supports their troops in combat, which is more complex, instead of robotic ways to commit genocide.",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a Uzi submachine gun on full automatic.

From some comments various people have left on this and the reporting it seems that it is not unusual for kids even younger then that to shoot real firearms.

This is ridiculous. Children (and I define that in this case as everyone under 18) are not nearly responsible enough to handle them. There is a reason we do not let little children drive cars or drink alcohol etc.

Childrens Brains (and even young adult's, but you have to draw the line somewhere) are still in the process of developing. We all have done stupid shit as children. Hell, just here on reddit I read about some guy who shot his brother *twice* as a kid. You may choose not be believe that story, but for me it seems plausible.

I know btw that the Instructor in this case made some critical mistakes as well, and that children shooting firearms have to be supervised. But still, if the Girl had the experiance, wisdom and patience that comes with being an adult, this would have never happened. 

An adult acts as another layer of protection to prevent an accident. In my view, having a child handle a firearm is a little like not exercising proper trigger discipline. If you do everything else right, nothing bad can really happen. But you should never rely on doing everything else right.

You might know some very mature and patient 14 year old who is really interested in hunting or sport shooting. In that case, congratulations. But I still stand by my view that that kid should wait and grow four more years. Sure, they might not get to shoot for four your years, but nobody will die.

/u/caw81 has slightly changed my view. Now I think only people under the age of 16 should be barred.

But the same can be said for PLENTY of people over 18. You say ""we have to draw the line somewhere"", but why at a specific age? Why can't a parent who responsibly owns and handles firearms properly supervise their child? People teach their children to do all sorts of things that COULD be hazardous, from grilling to driving to woodworking to boating and on and on and on; what makes firearms unique? Or should we just make sure no one under 18 ever gets experience or guidance doing such things?","People under 18 often hunt, not only for sport but to help feed their families. 

People under 18 often have to defend themselves both from potential human harms and from wild animals if they live rural or remote areas. 

People under 18 are at the age that we TRAIN them in how to use things such as firearms safely. Yes there will be accidents, and those are often tragic, but blanket statements like yours will increase the volume of poorly trained or untrained individuals getting access to guns, not lower it.",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A addresses the idea of age as the sole determining factor for firearm responsibility and argues that responsible parenting and supervision can play a significant role in teaching children how to handle firearms safely. By pointing out that there are plenty of adults who also cannot responsibly handle firearms, Reply A challenges the notion that age alone should be the deciding factor. Additionally, Reply A raises the question of why firearms should be treated differently from other potentially hazardous activities that children are taught to do with supervision. Overall, Reply A provides a more nuanced and thought-provoking argument that may prompt the original poster to reconsider their stance on age restrictions for handling firearms."
predict-explain,"First, I know ""egalitarian"" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word ""feminism"" has, but I feel like it's time for a change. 

The internet has caused a lot of voices that may otherwise be drowned out come to the forefront, such as the feminist extremists (or ""feminazis"" if you will). It seems that because of this many people are being turned off by the idea of feminism (myself included) because they associate that word with the people that blame all of life's problems on the patriarchy. 

My friends are starting to joke about feminism and I see more people mocking it every day. I believe it is due to the extremists, and how polarizing and antagonistic a lot of their views are. This stubbornness to stick to the name is causing a lot of people to dismiss, or even despise, the movement and is hurting it's support. I feel that if true feminists were willing to distance themselves from the ""feminazis"" it would stop a lot of animosity people have towards them. 

This might end up being as simple as calling it something different, because maybe the only ones that would keep the term ""feminism"" would be the extremists. They might want to retain the name so as to not give in or lose the fight. Of course there is no way of telling, and they may very well go along with the ""true feminists"" and call themselves egalitarian anyways. 

In either case, I feel like it would be beneficial to cause a clear divide between feminists and feminazis in order to garner more support and to have feminist ideas to be taken more seriously.

Change my view guys!","I think we just need to make the feminist organizations that are more egalitarian prominent. I personally have been doing research and haven't really found any, which doesn't mean they don't exist, but they should be brought out and heard. And if they don't exist, a group should be created. Media puts too much focus on the extremists in feminism, and that gives everyone a negative view of the word. I wish we heard more from feminist egalitarian organizations, or leaders too. Especially during times when the media starts showing all the extreme feminists doing things that are disrespectful and people start calling them feminazis. Then we could be like ""hey yeah, we know they're the extremists, but here are those of us that support equal rights.""","Others have already said a lot about this, so I'll leave you with [this](http://mikerugnetta.tumblr.com/post/123744373585/op-onions-pretty-disappointed-with-idea-channel), a really, really good post on why ""egalitarianism"" has come to be at odds with feminism and why feminism embodies the ideals of egalitarianism way, way better than egalitarianism does.

It's also worth pointing out that the ""feminazis"" (god, I hate that term) often have something resembling a point. I'm no fan of the Gawker-network callout culture that's become somewhat of a normalized force in internet discussions today, but I think that most of the internet's disdain of feminism comes from a caricatural portrayal brought about by cherry-picking examples of poorly-manifested attempts at feminism. I think it's valuable, next time you see a ""feminazi"" post, to look carefully at the source material and realize that, however acerbic or acidic the post might be, the author's coming from a legitimate place of pain much of the time, a place which unfortunately informs the tone of the piece.

Feminism as a movement is great. It tackles head-on many uncomfortable questions about inequality between genders that are reinforced thanks to vicious cycles and socialization, and if people who are benefiting from that inequality (myself included) are angry that people are calling them to think more critically about the advantages they've been handed, then so be it. I think there are some people who get turned off by the overwhelming minority of people who embody the movement poorly, but I think that more people get turned off by other men who already have a disdain for the movement - a disdain that will not be changed easily, especially by re-terming the movement.

I think that, in the end, there's a quote I'll paraphrase that I can't remember off the top of my head that describes the need for the term to stick around: in any article discussing feminism, the vitriol of the comments section validates the movement's need to exist. It's got power under its current name, even if many people wouldn't like to admit it, and as long as it continues to gather steam there's no reason to change it to another name dominated, as the Rugnetta post shows, by straight white men.",B,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more nuanced and in-depth analysis of the situation, addressing the concerns raised by the original poster while also providing a different perspective. The user acknowledges the existence of ""feminazis"" but also highlights the legitimate points they may be coming from. Additionally, the user argues that feminism embodies egalitarian ideals better than egalitarianism itself, and changing the name may not necessarily solve the issues at hand. 

Overall, Reply B presents a more well-rounded argument, delving into the complexities of the issue and providing a thoughtful reflection on the importance of feminism as a movement. This depth and insight are likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially change their view on the matter."
predict-explain,"By ""practical reason,"" I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election.  I admit there can be other reasons to vote--social pressure, solidarity, civic pride, etc.  But on a practical level, I can reasonably expect no difference between the world in which I vote and the world in which I stay home, except that in the former I'd have to go out of my way to perform additional actions.  If I'm trying to decide whether to perform those actions, based on pure self-interest, there is no reason for me to vote.  I'm setting this at the level of national elections (specifically thinking of U.S. elections) because it's true that, given a small enough ""nation,"" your individual vote would carry a significant probability of making a difference.  

This is a classic example of a [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action), and after considering this class of problems thoroughly, I've come to the conclusion that there is no self-interested practical reason to participate in these cases, barring external motivators (such as added incentives).

It would be nice to find a reason to believe this isn't a case, so I look forward to someone convincing me!","Just because it's incredibly unlikely that your vote will make a difference doesn't mean it's never going to happen. Suppose a state like Wyoming (voter turnout of 249,000 last general election) was polling 50/50 (or 47/47, or 43/43, etc.) going into the election. A Wyomingite could guess there's a thousand or so votes separating the candidates at most, and determine that these odds are worth the minimal investment required to make the trip to the voting booths.

And it's not like this is purely theoretical either - there have been a few examples of state elections being decided by only a couple hundreds of votes. A 1974 Senate election (223,000 votes) in New Hampshire was decided by **2** votes only. Maybe sooner or later it'll be decided by one.","The same ballot for Presidential and Congressional elections will also have a number of other state and local positions and issues that are up for vote, many of which your vote would be significant (only 1000s or even 100s of voters).  For example, during the last Presidential election, there was a ballot initiative to merge the town next to mine that failed to pass, 72-72 votes.

While it might not make sense to go out of your way just to vote for those elections in which your vote is insignificant, it does make sense if you are already there to vote for things where your vote is significant.  Then you are putting in a very low amount of effort for a very low amount of impact.",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides concrete examples of elections that were decided by very small margins, demonstrating that individual votes can make a difference. This challenges the original poster's assertion that there is no self-interested practical reason to participate in elections. Additionally, Reply A acknowledges the statistical unlikelihood of one's vote making a difference but still argues that it is worth the minimal investment required to vote. This practical approach may resonate more with the original poster who was looking for reasons to believe that voting can make a difference."
predict-explain,"I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to abortion. I haven't really followed the lion thing, that was just an example. People do this in all sorts of conversations. 

I find this reasoning completely flawed. Are we only going to care about the most important issue? Before we care/talk about something do we have to make sure there is no issue more important?  Also, the conversation about X is already happening. The issue is out in the open and people are passionate about solving it. This is great and a bit rare. We should roll with it when people want to make positive change instead of making them feel bad for being passionate about the wrong thing.  People have the capacity to care about more than one issue. Humanity as a whole can work together to solve more than one problem at once. Saying something like this you are trying to derail the argument about X  rather than help either argument.

Edit* This is about society's problems and public conversations rather than individual problems.

Nobody's arguing that the lion's death isn't tragic. People are arguing that the lion's death is not so tragic that it's worth completely ignoring yet more examples of not only police brutality but straight-up lies told by the police to cover that brutality up. We want positive change, sure, but it's good to prioritize.

You say that ""people have the capacity to care about more than one issue."" This is true. However, people also only have a finite capacity to care about issues in general. When certain issues are shoved far enough out of the spotlight in favor of - quite frankly - more important ones, these issues stop being cared about enough to actually effect change.

Tl;dr: it's not that we shouldn't care about ""less important"" issues, it's that we have a finite amount of time and space and mental energy to care about issues in general. Therefore, we should apportion appropriately and not give undue attention to an issue which is not as important.","A agree with you until you wrote the word never. 

Absolutes are kind of hard to defend.

predict-explain,"To me, this is the exact same issue, just a different year. In 1967, the US passed a law which made it legal for two people of different races to marry; and just recently, in the year 2015, the US made it legal for two people of the same sex to marry. 

Some of the arguments i have seen in opposition of gay marriage are:

* ""homosexuality is a sin""

* ""not natural""

* ""erodes the sanctity of marriage""

* ""slippery slope leading to marriage of _____""

* ""not healthy for children""

* ""goes against God""

These all seem to be the same arguments that were presented in the 1950's and 1960's when people were fighting for marriage equality between the races. So why haven't people learned anything about equality over the last 60 years?


edit #1: The best argument iv seen thus far was by /u/moonflower when they said

Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","The fundamental difference between state sanctioned interracial marriage and gay marriage is what they are promoting as a social norm. In interracial marriage the norm that is being promoted is that people do not need to be kept separate because of their racial characteristics, that integration of racial groups is a social good that we want to promote (or at least isn't an ill that should outweigh the good of marriage).

Gay marriage is an attempt to normalise a certain types of sexual relationships by raising their legal status and making them legally equivalent to others.

They are quite different things….","The opposition to interracial marriage was based on the belief that certain races were genetically inferior (whatever that means). Yes, people cited their religion for reasons, but ultimately that's what it would come back to (for the most part). Since 'genetic inferiority' is a scientific claim, it requires scientific evidence to support it. There is none, in fact there is plenty to disprove it. So interracial marriage happened without problem. (I like what other commenters have said about interracial marriage not changing the definition of marriage). 

Opposition to same-sex marriage is based on opposition to specific *actions*, and not wanting the government to sanction and support those actions. People who are opposed to same-sex marriage would also be opposed to two heterosexuals of the same sex getting married. The marrying couple's sexual *orientation* is not the target of disapproval, it's the *actions* of two individuals. (Yes, I am aware that many people who oppose same-sex marriage also actively hate or are at least grossed out by gay people--but that is irrelevant to a discussion of the possible social repercussions of legalizing same-sex marriage.) The fact that certain people are biologically predisposed to want to do those actions, and others are completely *not* interested in doing them, is a confusing side note to this argument. 

This is a distinction that will probably be hard to make sense of, especially since I had trouble trying to explain it. Let me know if you have points you'd like clarified. 

I'd like to echo what others have said, and what has been said for the past several years: The government's interest in marriage is in harboring a place to raise successful citizens. Every solid study I've read up on shows that a child's best chance is to be raised by its biological parents*. Whenever possible, the government supports this with tax breaks and by attaching things like inheritance and hospital visitation rights to marriage. Since the child of same-sex partners cannot be raised by both biological parents, they are automatically at a disadvantage. At least, that's the argument. 

*I know there are studies out there that suggest that same-sex parents are just as likely to raise successful children as the biological parents. Every one of these studies that I've looked at has been deeply flawed--usually with non-random samples (parents who volunteer for a study about successful parenting are probably going to be the ones who are doing pretty well), extremely small sample sizes, or by comparing a population of same-sex parents that got their children through the difficult and expensive process of adoption to a population of heterosexual parents of all types--adopters, planned parents, accidental parents, etc. From what I understand, the meta-study the Supreme Court cited in their decision was a study of these flawed studies. Feel free to link a good study on same-sex parents.",B,A,"I would say that reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a clear distinction between the historical opposition to interracial marriage and the current opposition to same-sex marriage. It argues that interracial marriage was about promoting integration and equality, while same-sex marriage is about normalizing specific types of relationships. This argument challenges the original poster to consider the underlying motivations behind the opposition to same-sex marriage in a different light.

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the actions and consequences of legalizing same-sex marriage, particularly in relation to child-rearing. While it does provide some interesting points about the government's interest in marriage and the potential social repercussions of legalizing same-sex marriage, it doesn't directly address the comparison between interracial marriage and same-sex marriage that the original poster raised.

Overall, reply A provides a more direct and thought-provoking response to the original poster's question, making it more likely to change their view."
predict-explain,"I'm Korean-American and I have family in Korea. I disagree with many of those I encounter who usually tend to also be of Korean descent when I don't get all too frantic about the idea of war on the peninsula. I feel as if this conflict, whether it is dormant or tense or whatever, must be dealt with in the future and we're just kicking the can down the road.

1. Many people would die, regardless. People are dying under the famines and in the concentration camps. The longer we wait, the more people will suffer and die. Taking action as soon as possible would cause a high death toll but can potentially be made up for it by the fact that we'd be taking action soon and not ""whenever unexpected situations lead us to."" Plus, it's arguable that simply leaving things be is 'inhumane'.
2. Long-term, a unified Korea would turn into an economic powerhouse. We have two countries with very strong work ethics, a country with a ton of technological advancements and billionaire tech companies, another country with a ton of cheap labor (that can help jump start the economy after unification), lots of natural resources that would offset the costs, and infrastructure that must be built in the northern half of the peninsula. Some experts say a unified Korea can surpass Japan in economic power.
3. I highly doubt China would be as uncomfortable having a unified, US-influenced Korea on their doorstep like people say they'd be. It's not like people aren't able to fly from Beijing to Seoul or New York City; they're aware of lifestyle in first world countries. China and South Korea are, contrary to popular belief, close allies. The number of refugees who would attempt to cross the Chinese border would probably be minimal if China expresses force in the region and South Koreans distribute food effectively and quickly. Furthermore, they know they'd have to go through sex trafficking and risk of death if they want to go through China... and then go where?

I have a very open mind when it comes to this issue. The reason why I am posting this is because I see others worrying a lot when seeing news of a potential resumption of war while I feel a sense of hope. But my thinking may be entirely backwards. I'd like to see opposing arguments to this topic. Thanks for reading!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","Let's go by your points one by one:

1. It's easy to say this so casually when your entire way of life and your actual life itself is not what's at risk. A war with North Korea could trigger some very hard times for both North and South. Any economic benefits to be reaped would likely be in the long term. It's easy to call for sacrifice when you are not the one sacrificing. Who is to say unification will save lives? Violent, forced unification might cause extreme civil unrest, decades of terrorism, and continued or even accelerated loss of life on both sides. Unifying through full on war and unifying post-North Korean collapse are very different prospects that entail different likelihoods of success.

2. That is true. Many experts predict that unification could be an economic boon. The same Goldman Sachs report that you are unknowingly referencing also states that this is under the assumption of most optimal circumstances (i.e. gradual and peaceful reunification). That circumstance is only most likely post natural internal North Korean collapse and not through violent takeover. North Korea is not ready to be a stable state if taken over.

3. 60 years of consisted foreign policy doesn't change overnight. Their greatest concerns aren't cultural ones and more military. China, despite being a large coastal country, is landlocked militarily speaking by two great island chains - both of which are, in one way or another, under US control. The Korean peninsula is part of these chains (they form the mainland connection to the islands). North Korea falling further exacerbates America's cornering of China. It's a militarily strategic concern more than anything.

Again, I think it's important to emphasize this. It's easy to be hawkish when it's not your life that's being thrown away. Some things to keep in mind.","The government of South Korea represents the people of South Korea, not the entire Korean peninsula.  War and re-unification would be terrible for South Koreans, even if it would probably help North Koreans in the long run.

South Korea is already an economic powerhouse, they don't need the north for that. Taking on the cost of modernizing North Korea would put an incredible strain on the government and the nation as a whole.  It would hurt their economy for decades, not help it.

So war would cost many South Korean lives and significant destruction in South Korea, and it wouldn't gain them anything other than tremendous debt.",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a more nuanced and detailed analysis of the potential consequences of war and unification, highlighting the risks and challenges involved. It also emphasizes the importance of considering the human cost and the potential for civil unrest and continued loss of life. Additionally, Reply A addresses the economic implications of unification and the strategic concerns for China, providing a more comprehensive argument against the original poster's viewpoint. Overall, Reply A presents a more compelling argument that takes into account a broader range of factors and potential outcomes."
predict-explain,"I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several reasons to holdthis view - here they are, sorted by relevance (from least to most relevant). 

* They eat poo.
* They are annoying. Many people have really strong opinions against smoking in public, because it is upsetting them and accordingly laws have been past in many countries that limit/prohibit smoking in public transport, public buildings, etc. However, it is not uncommon to be leg-humped by a dog in the bus, or step into dog-poo in the park, which I find really annoying. This seems to be regarded as unproblematic, some pepole even get annoyed if you do not want to touch their animal companion with questionable hygiene standards.* You may say that (contrary to smoking) these are merely inconveniences, but in fact...
* ...Some dogs are plain dangerous. Have a look at the [""Fatal dog attacks""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States) wiki entry. Granted, there are MUCH more people dying from cars, cigaretts, cancer (and that's only deadly stuff with a C), etc. but in my opinion even one person would be too much. There are a lot of young children on the list as well. 
* My rant so far may have given you the opinion that I just hate animals. However, the opposite is true - I love them! Therefore I think we shouldn't keep them for our amusement or because we fancy a walk once or twice a day. 
* They eat. In a world where people are starving this is in my opinion morally not justifiable. 
* Most importantly: They produce greenhouse gases - and quite a lot of them! [The co2-""paw print"" of a big dog that gets fed mostly meat may even be bigger than the emissions caused by an SUV.](http://www.salon.com/2014/11/20/the_surprisingly_large_carbon_paw_print_of_your_beloved_pet_partner/)

Therefore I am convinced that you probably shouldn't own a dog. I will not be convinced by single examples where a dog was useful, but by reasons why the overall benefits of private dog-owenership surpass the negetive effects I have listed above. Please CMV!

(*)The fanatic dog-loving may be an issue particular to Germany.



**EDIT: Deltas have been awarded to the argument that dogs ""sage lives"" by providing companionship, and helping with mental as well as physical health issues. It may therefore be argued that these safed lives make up for the harm that dogs cause elsewhere. Thanks to /u/stoopydumbut, /u/RustyRook, and /u/jiw123. (Others have also made the same point later). Thanks for the interesting discussion. At the very least I learned that I am pretty alone in my distaste for dog poo :)**

**EDIT 2: Ok, it's 3am where I am and I think all arguments that can be made about the issue have been made. Good night and thanks again for the discussion!**

That's a reason to not leave poo lying around, no a reason to get rid of a dog.

When you say ""you"" shouldn't own a dog, do you mean specifically me? Because I don't live in Germany so my dog won't hump your leg on the bus or poop in your park. Those seem to be problems with Germany, not problems with dogs.

Dogs sometimes kill people, but they also sometimes save people's lives.

It's true that he consumes resources and produces CO2, but by that reasoning, I shouldn't own anything.","What do you propose we do with dogs after we stop owning them? Do we start killing millions of them daily? If not then all your complaints will still exist, worse even. Feral dogs with no reliable food source will attack people far more regularly and viciously, they will still be annoying and eat poo.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A addresses each point made by the original poster and provides counterarguments for each one. It challenges the idea that dogs are inherently problematic and suggests that responsible ownership and behavior can mitigate many of the issues raised. Additionally, it brings up the positive aspects of dog ownership, such as the potential for dogs to save lives. 

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the practical implications of the original poster's proposal to stop owning dogs. While it raises valid points about the potential consequences of mass abandonment of dogs, it does not directly address the arguments made by the original poster. 

Overall, Reply A engages directly with the original poster's points and provides a more comprehensive rebuttal, making it more likely to change their view."
predict-explain,"Scientists widely accept that climate change is real. Consequently, they say that it will lead to extreme weather, a raise in the sea level, increased acidity of the ocean, reduced sea and ice cover, and drought. These effects will in turn impact not only human's general well-being, but will also displace coastal settlements and cities, negatively effect food sources, destroy ecosystems, and more.
Furthermore,
&gt; ""It is increasingly evident that the policy actions by these countries and others will not be enough to stave off a rise in the atmospheric temperature of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. At that point, scientists say, the planet will be locked into a future of extreme storms, droughts, food and water shortages, and rising sea levels.""

Thus, I think the number one concern for the human race as a whole should be climate change, and I find it hard to justify any other causes. Yes, human rights and the economy are important, immediate concerns--But, in the end, it won't matter in if the planet becomes uninhabitable. So climate change and efforts to reverse or combat it should be the dominant issue in the world now. Instead, of focusing on raising the minimum wage or gay rights, we should devote most of our resources and energy to solving climate change.
I'm liberal. I think there are tons of important issues that we need to address--education, gun control, mental health, women's rights--but these issues should be secondary to protecting our home.

Everybody talks about it. But one thing I wish we could focus on is real solutions like more efficient ways to produce and distribute food (Hint: the solution isn't shipping chicken from the U.S. to China for processing and then shipping it back to the U.S.), ways to produce energy that doesn't involve burning a lot of fossil fuels or use up a lot of land the way solar panel ""farms"" do, etc., etc. We know what the problem is. We just need real world solutions to solving it that don't presume that every individual human is going to make drastic changes to their lifestyles just to cut down on their impact. At this point, climate change is likely to get worse before it gets better no matter what we do. Now it's just a matter of making sure humanity can survive the experience even if it means finding all the *right* ways to change a planet.","&gt;  Thus, I think the number one concern for the human race as a whole should be climate change, and I find it hard to justify any other causes. 

Climate change won't destroy the entire human race.  In all probability it will cause widespread famine and kill innumerable people through hunger.  Don't get me wrong, it will be horrific and expansive in it's scope, but it won't be the end of humanity.  Ultimately what we're talking about then is prospect of world hunger.  How is that different from the other global problem; current world hunger?  If you think about it long enough, you'll realize that it's just that this one has the potential of killing *you* and *me* while the other one has the potential of killing off kids in places so poor that the internet doesn't exist.

It's hard to make the argument that one is worse.  It's just that one is worse *for you and me*.

Would you then agree that since the current world hunger is a problem we are experiencing and climate change is a problem we may one day experience; then current world hunger should be added to the front of the line?  


&gt;  Instead, of focusing on raising the minimum wage or gay rights, we should devote most of our resources and energy to solving climate change. 

Or lets make the perspective more granular.  If you are working 80 hours a week at minimum wage to pay for your family's bills.  You can get them to survive, but you can't afford an education or any other luxuries.  Your kids will have to work as soon as they are humanly able, thereby forgoing their opportunities to progress and perpetuating the cycle.  Given that situation, would you also think that your life of quasi-slavery is less important than the potential of global warming?


It all comes down to survival.  I can see why you would argue that survival is important when you are in danger.  I cannot see how you can make an objective case where your survival is more important than another's survival.",B,B,"I believe reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A acknowledges the importance of climate change but also brings up the need for practical solutions that can be implemented on a larger scale without relying solely on individual lifestyle changes. By focusing on solutions such as more efficient food production and alternative energy sources, reply A offers a more nuanced approach to tackling climate change. Additionally, reply A addresses the potential worsening of climate change before it gets better, highlighting the urgency of finding effective solutions. 

On the other hand, reply B attempts to shift the focus to current world hunger as a global issue that is already affecting people, rather than solely focusing on the potential future impacts of climate change. While reply B makes valid points about the importance of addressing current global issues, it does not directly address the original poster's argument about the urgency of prioritizing climate change over other causes. 

Overall, reply A provides a more comprehensive and persuasive argument by acknowledging the importance of climate change while also emphasizing the need for practical solutions and the urgency of the situation."
predict-explain,"So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument.
All modern economic transactions involving physical items (no stocks, capital, etc.) can be simplified down to a trade of money for labor. Yes, you can buy an item off the shelf at someplace like Target, but what you're really buying is the labor involved in making that item, the item being the end result of it. In other words, it is impossible to buy a physical item that is not shaped and made valuable by labor. In this sense, what you do when you walk to a pizzaria and buy a pizza is *directly* contract the labor of the pizza maker in exchange for money (as opposed to indirect contracting through a store, e.g. DiGornios). Because of this, businesses should have the right to refuse to labor for any particular individual, *for any reason*. If this is NOT the case, and some outside authority can force a person to preform labor they don't wish to preform, that could be seen as a type of slavery (I hate to use the term), because an outside authority is forcing a person, under the threat of force, to labor, even when that person doesn't want to.  
So prove me wrong everyone, help me come to better formulate and understand my own ideas! That's what this sub is about, after all.
Please excuse the weird grammar and sentence structure, I just woke up","Businesses have the right to refuse service to any individual for any reason.

They do not have the right to refuse services to protected classes of individuals based on their belonging to that class when they provide those services to other equally qualified customers. 

The first is about individuals. If a black gay female comes into my store, acts like a complete and total jerk I can toss them out for not being someone I want to do business with. I can refuse service because I don't want to be busy that day. I can refuse service because I don't like them individually. I can refuse service because I just feel like it. 

The second is about groups of people. I can not refuse service to black gay females because they are black gay females. I can not withhold services from a person for reasons that have nothing to do with them individually and result only from my assumption of their inclusion in a particular group. 

The reason for this is simple but multi-faceted and rests on a few bits of reality that people don't like to think about sometimes:

1) Businesses exist because of civil society. There's a reason Somalia isn't a libertarian utopia even though there's absolutely no government interference in business. It is because there is no civil society at all that businesses can not function there at all. This is more than just about government and law enforcement too. Governments allow the existence of a high functioning civil society: working infrastructure for business; schooling so that businesses have literate employees; working financial systems by which to transact business; means for customers to move from business to business safely to conduct transactions; and so forth. However, governments are not the sum total of a high functioning civil society. This requires more than a government. Syria has a government. But the people of Syria are not free to live their lives unencumbered by unnecessary interferences in their lives. The question is what interferences are necessary and which are not. Civil society, in the experience of history, seems to work best when all members of society can decide that question together; and with their collective, rather than individual, best interests as the focus. 

2) Because business depend on civil society, civil society has authority to tell businesses what they can and can not do in order to maintain that civil society. This includes following laws that limit the freedoms of businesses. Businesses, just like individuals, have to respect the rights of others. You can not intentionally harm other people for no justifiable reason. While you can punch someone in self-defense, the legal defense against that charge is a positive defense not a negative one. That is, you can't say ""self defense"" and walk away. You generally have to be able to show that it was self-defense. You can punch someone in the face. But if you don't have a reason for doing so that society accepts as valid, you've violated their rights and exceeded your own. Likewise, businesses can't do things that are obviously harmful to society, such as dumping raw sewage into the public drinking water. 

3) One of the lessons of the civil rights movement is that ""separate isn't equal."" For civil society to work we all need to have reasonable access to the aspects of society that make society function as a civil society. It is a violation of an individual's rights to execute their own life to preclude them from society on the basis of basic discriminatory practices of the majority. We can't simply say we don't want black people in our schools, or that gay people can not drive on the roads, or that women shall not have access to jobs.  And again, we know that civil society is more than merely the collection of government functions. It doesn't matter if black people have access to the same rights as white people if there are no black people in the area because no one will do business with them outside of the government. 

4) Civil society, while dependent upon government is more than government. Through the 1900s people exercised their ""individual freedom"" to refuse business to those in minority groups. The results were segregated communities where black people simply could not live. No one would sell them a private home because the mortgage clauses came with rules against reselling the homes to black people. No one would sell them food, because the local grocers wouldn't do business with ""those people."" No one would treat them if they were sick and injured, so they would die without proper medical care unnecessarily. None of this involved the power of the state. But the collective actions of individuals of the majority precluding minorities from participating in civil society created significant civil strife and endangered civil society's continued existence. 

5) Ergo, the people of the democratic republic demanded that civil society address the issues of lack of inclusion of minorities. The result was that civil society decided collectively that businesses were free to exist and operate within civil society but one of the personal rights they could not violate was the right to not be discriminated against based on membership in a protected minority. Now, this law has plenty of controversy around what should and should not be a protected minority. However, there's absolutely zero basis for any contention that civil society, upon which a businesses ability to exist depends, lacks the authority to set such rules. Further, the experience of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries demonstrates quite clearly that failure to consider overt discrimination a crime resulted in significant social harms that negatively impacted civil society in a way that was considered unacceptable, and legitimately threatened it's continued existence.","One of the fundamental measures of equality is inclusion and participation in general society. In local communities, being able to eat in the same restaurants, shop in the same stores, attend the same religious services and generally do all the same things as everyone else is in itself a demonstration of freedom and proof of equal legal status.

Being excluded from such activities singles out individuals in a manner that is not only humiliating but also subjugates those being excluded by denying them the same freedom as everyone else.

We already exclude and/or remove criminals and those adjudicated mentally defective (or whatever term you prefer) when they demonstrate either a willingness or inability to participate in society in a responsible, trustworthy and/or equitable manner, but only after we can demonstrate that fact according to strict rules and procedures in the judicial system. These rules and structures are in place precisely because the unjust or arbitrary exercise of power, especially to deny the freedom of others, or to otherwise violate their rights, is the very definition of [Oppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression). 

[Liberty](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/liberty) is the ability to live, speak or otherwise act freely, especially without retribution or oppression. 

We all have a right to Liberty. 

In the context of America and the philosophy of Individual Rights, which is the basis of our legal system, power and authority are derived from the function of the institutions that exercise that power. Cops can't arbitrarily arrest people for being ugly, they must conduct arrests in accordance with the laws and structures that empower them. 

Similarly, individual citizens cannot arbitrarily exercise power or authority over other citizens. 

A gay person entering a business with the intention of paying for services or products is not inherently damaging to a business. Denying such a person service based on the individual beliefs of an owner or employee would be an arbitrary exercise of power, in direct violation of the customer's Right to Liberty. Denying said customer legal recourse against such arbitrary exclusion would indirectly legitimize such exclusion and establish a *de facto* second class of citizens, which is inherently unconstitutional and blatantly harmful for what should be obvious reasons.

It doesn't matter if the ""Free Market"" would deal with the problem (which btw, does not happen in areas of the country where such beliefs prevail). Excluding people due to personal beliefs is a violation of the Right to Liberty.

That doesn't even get into the fact that business owners utilize mail, law enforcement, contract law, trade agreements and property rights, among many other things which obligate business owners to treat tax-paying customers equally.",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides a detailed and comprehensive explanation of why businesses should not have the right to refuse service to protected classes of individuals based on their belonging to that class. It addresses the importance of civil society, the rights of individuals, the lessons of the civil rights movement, and the negative impact of discrimination on society. Reply A also provides examples and reasoning that are likely to make the original poster reconsider their stance on the issue. On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the concept of liberty and individual rights, which may not be as effective in changing the original poster's view on the topic."

Republicans are smart &amp; focused about targeting competitive areas and maximizing every possible systemic advantage they can muster (voter suppression, redistricting, controlling local establishment, big dollar advertising) and tend to have more consistent voter turn out (the elderly and angry white people).

The Democrats voter turnout is more inconsistent though, as they tend to rely on groups that only get out and vote when really excited (the young, economically disadvantaged).

It's really up to the Democrats if they want to win or lose a presidential election.  We've seen *exactly* what happens when they think the Republican can't win: they get complacent and nominate a boring establishment candidate that fails to energize their flakier base, and they fuck it up.  See Al Gore &amp; John Kerry.

That's why the seemingly inevitable Hillary nomination scares me.  No one is excited about Hillary.  It's the boring conservative choice that repeatedly loses the Democrats elections.

She's the new brightest star in the party, and has the ability to run the formula that worked well for Clinton and Obama.",B,A,"I would say that Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides specific examples of popular Republican candidates in their home states, John Kasich and Marco Rubio, and highlights their approval ratings. This gives the original poster concrete evidence that there are viable Republican candidates who could potentially win a presidential election.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the potential pitfalls of the Democratic party, particularly in nominating a candidate like Hillary Clinton who may not excite the base. While this is a valid point, it doesn't directly address the original poster's concerns about the GOP's stances on social issues.

Overall, Reply A provides a more direct and optimistic outlook on the potential for a Republican president to win in the future, which may be more persuasive to the original poster."
predict-explain,"America has accomplished nothing in its history that makes it worth of such widespread pride and love by its people (particularly this time of the year). Every event that Americans glorify either has a disgusting background to it or is grossly misread by most people. These are some examples:

-Industrial revolution: Granted high developments in technology and economic prowess were built on slavery, child labor, discrimination against immigrants, poverty and greedy, amoral robber barons and corrupt politicians.

World War 2: Significant military power, certainly helped turn the tide, still killed 300,000 civilians with atomic weapons and put Asian Americans in camps (with little reparation that came way too late).

Really? I completely agree with you that America has done a lot of terrible things (and I think you're actually leaving out [some of the worst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs)), but America, and Americans, have also done some really amazing things.

The American Revolution directly inspired the French Revolution (which ended up with a dictatorship, if you'll recall, hardly ""doing it better"" imo). We were instrumental in stopping the Nazis, and accepted far more refugees from them than anywhere else. We cured polio. One single American has been credited with [""saving a billion lives""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug). We invented the Internet. We make most of the world's pop culture, and have for over a century (Bollywood notwithstanding).  We have produced 353 Nobel Prize winners, beating out the second place country (Germany) by more than a factor of three. We invented jazz, hip-hop, and rock and roll.

These are all just off the top of my head. America has done a lot of bad stuff, for sure, but it's also been an enormous source of innovation and invention. It's just ridiculous the amount of stuff that has come out of America.","I think you're making a selectively negative reading of US history that doesn't account for the enormous human progress that has been made in substantial part due to the existence and persistence of the United States.

&gt;The American Revolution: It did involve great thinkers and advancement of political philosophy, but the French did it better, 

WHAT?!

The French Revolution was a disaster!  Their first elected government was [overthrown by a violent mob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_August_\(French_Revolution\)) and [started a war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars) that would persist for a decade to come.  Their domestic government quickly turned into [a totalitarian dictatorship that murdered tens of thousands of political enemies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror) and was then succeeded by a [reactionary coup d'etat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermidorian_Reaction).

And after all that, what did France get?  [Napoleon,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon) who was a dictatorial and warmongering emperor.

The American Revolution was followed by peace, the establishment of an actually elected government, and when problems did arise, a peaceful solution in the form of the Constitutional Convention.  The transition from Adams to Jefferson after the brutally contentious election of 1800 was probably the first peaceful transition of power between political adversaries in a sovereign state the world had seen for over a thousand years.

&gt;and American Revolution was an overreaction to British enforcement of fair taxes that paid for the 7 Years War to protect Americans.

It was a mutual escalation, with colonial tax protests being met with [excessive reprisals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerable_Acts) from the British crown.  [Many within the British Parliament sympathized with the Americans](https://almostchosenpeople.wordpress.com/2009/12/17/edmund-burke-and-the-american-revolution/) and thought the government was being foolish, even if sentiment was generally that they shouldn't have gone to war.

&gt;-Industrial revolution: Granted high developments in technology and economic prowess were built on slavery, child labor, discrimination against immigrants, poverty and greedy, amoral robber barons and corrupt politicians.

I think you're putting a far more negative gloss on this than is justified.  First, most of the massive economic growth of the US took place after the Civil War, and were not primarily driven by slave labor at any point.  Second, the effects of that economic growth on human wellbeing across the country today are enormous.  Standards of living are very high in the US today, and there is no country on Earth which has industrialized without having poor labor market conditions in its early industrial period.

Also, immigrants to America in this era weren't dupes.  They moved here because America really did offer opportunity to make a life for yourself that wasn't available anywhere else in the world at the time.

&gt;Civil War: The fact that it needed to happen and that a flag that represents those who fought to defend slavery is still being flown and celebrated is disappointing.

Obviously slavery is a dark mark on American history, and I have nothing to say in its defense, except that the north could have let the south secede, and a major reason that it did not play out that way was a moral opposition to slavery.

&gt;World War 2: Significant military power, certainly helped turn the tide, still killed 300,000 civilians with atomic weapons and put Asian Americans in camps (with little reparation that came way too late).

Again, nothing to say in defense of internment, but will note that the US did not start WWII, and did not fully enter it until it was attacked by the Japanese and declared war on by the Germans.  War is nasty business though, and if you're looking for a war fought by ethical means, you'll never find one.

&gt;Of course there are worse countries in the world, but current day America is a wreck. Frequent mass shootings that don't really happen in other developed countries, continued high race tensions, religious fundamentalism in the South and a poor education system. So tell me CMV, is there any reason to celebrate or be proud of my country?

Current day America has problems, but we're not a wreck.  Crime is way down, our economic situation is doing much better than most other developed countries,  and we still have a reasonably functional government which allows for peaceful political discourse and meaningfully defends Americans' civil rights.

Is it perfect?  Hell no.  Is life in contemporary America one of the best places and times in human history to be alive?  Yes.  And that's saying something.",B,A,"I would say that reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more balanced perspective on American history, acknowledging the negative aspects while also highlighting the positive contributions and progress that the United States has made. The response effectively counters the original poster's arguments by providing historical context and explaining the complexities of key events like the American Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. 

Additionally, reply B addresses the current issues facing America but also emphasizes the positive aspects of contemporary American society, such as the low crime rate and economic prosperity. This balanced approach is more likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially lead them to reconsider their negative view of the country."
predict-explain,"While I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems.

I believe that we will never be satisfied with what we have, there will never be equality for all, we'll continue to destroy the environment and in the end, we will all die a much worse death trying to live happily than one that would come form purposefully erasing our existence. Looking at it from another perspective, it's like eradicating the parts of DNA needed to make tonsils so that humans never again deal with tonsillitis. In that analogy, the human body would be the Earth and tonsils would be the people. Tonsillitis would be the possibility of people doing bad things and removing the DNA would be what we do to get rid of humans. I just think that, not taking feelings into account and going with the quickest and simplest option, remove the problems from the root is ideal. Once again, this does not take into account feelings of people as obviously most of us don't want to die, regardless if it would be better for the planet.

Of course, erasing humans from the planet is much simpler than you'd expect. It also doesn't have to be prolonged or painful as would be our deaths from a polluted world and from wars. I am sure that within 50 years, a group could easily genetically engineer a strain of virus to get the job done. Mass production of asbestos and coordinated release all over the world could work too. What I'm saying is that it's pretty easy and could be done quickly. Nothing more, nothing less.

Now, this is all assuming a few things:

- That if humanity continues, we will eventually cease to exist against our will.
- That humanity will never have true equality.
- That war will always continue in some form.
- That we will continue polluting/degrading the Earth as long as we exist.

If each human somehow became the ""God"" of their own universe (though I have no idea how that would come about) then I believe there would be no problem with each individual existence, as controlling your own universe means that no matter what you do you are in the right. Of course, that is all BS/fiction and we live just like all the animals on the Earth, aside from being special in our own little ways. I don't think we as a whole can ever fully agree on anything, and that our disagreements will always cause us problems.

Once again, I believe the destruction of the entire human population to be our best solution.

As an aside, some other animal may eventually evolve to be intelligent in the manner we are, so the possibility of simply destroying all life to forever end suffering of any kind on this planet is considered.

predict-explain,"I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying this was shameful, and embarrassing to the US military, a ridiculous simplification. To be clear, I am no fan of Huckabee, and I have nothing against our military or militaries in general. That said, I think he was dead on.

I think most people who don't accept this do so because they think it's crass, and brutal. Well, yeah, but it's also absolutely true. That's why the military has all those rifles and artillery and tanks and battleships and bombs and chemical weapons and knives and humvees and machine guns: for the killing of people and the breaking of things. Sure, not every member of the military's job is to be a killer, but those people are there to support the killers. The cooks, mechanics, engineers, and secretaries are all there to let everyone else kill people and break things as safely and efficiently as possible.

Again, I have absolutely no problem with this from a moral perspective. I am certainly not condemning anybody, just stating facts. Most people I've seen disagree with Huckabee are just dancing around this. ""Soldiers exist to protect the United States and her interests!"" Sure, using violence or the threat of violence. ""The army doesn't just kill people, they developed the Internet!"" Yeah, as a weapon to coordinate their violence in the most efficient way possible. The internet we have now is just an unintended side effect.

The US military is in a bit of a unique position, since they haven't had a lot of opportunities to do their job recently. Our military is so badass, there are not a lot of people with enough courage or stupidity to take us on. Thus, a lot of time is spent running practice drills and handing out food to people after earthquakes. That's great, but it's all a displacement activity until they need to do their real job. It's a sideshow, a distraction. The alternative would be these men sitting around, waiting for something to need destroying. We don't keep our military around and spend billions of dollars for disaster relief. We keep them around to kill people and break things. That's their real purpose, simple as that.

predict-explain,"A friend and I were talking about the current candidates and she couldn't understand why Trump was doing so well in the polls.  The best I could articulate it is that he is the most populist candidate out, his politics are moderate but heavily nationalist, his demeanor is one of our idealized archetypes, and he is wealthy but appears genuine, achieving a halo effect (unlike Romney.)  

After realizing this, I asked several other people, and realized that basically my friends, like Clinton, don't like how he communicates, but then have no major disagreement with the content.

Am I missing something?  Is there a good reason to dismiss him as a candidate?  More importantly, who is real competition for him?

***EDIT****
From todays conversations:
I see an argument for why he may not have a good chance in an election (delta awarded), mainly in that whatever percentage of his 25% popularity is republican is all he may get from the republicans, and as a more mainstream candidate arises, the split votes wont go to him (that is, the people who polled for him may be all that would poll for him in the primary, given any other more mainstream republican candidate.

However, I have seen no compelling argument for why he is not a populist candidate.  Some have tried to narrow the definition of a populist to being representative of a position or policies that in some fashion clearly serve the underserve or/and the majority, but this is difficult to define, and ignores the perception.  One person argued at length that the self perception of the constituency as victim and the candidate's policy being to address that sense of victimization is what makes them populist, and while I can agree that it is a fine definition, the person then asserts that this is not trump, and I disagree, as Trump clearly paints the American people as victimized by poor, self interested leadership, a corrupt political culture, and compromised ideas and strategies, and his entire platform is about going in as a normal private citizen and fixing it.

Many (most?) have simply tried to argue that he is too insulting to win, but I remain unconvinced that that would stop a sizable percentage of Americans from voting for him.  This is because Americans don't actually value formality and decorum as much as power and conviction.  For the same reason that this is the America we have, I can't see how a candidate, fundamentally in favor of current nationalist policies, but simultaneously harping on being free from big money interests and the many leadership deficits that are frustrating Americans, isn't hitting so many of the right cords with mainstream America.

If he sticks to a policy (rather than sentiment,) that is antithetical to a group, then another would be preferred by that group.  But a career politician vs Trump, both speaking in vagaries, I see Trump coming out on top rather consistently.  (Saw a headline today, Trump took a hit in polls for being in favor of higher taxes, this looks like an example of the very thing.)

He doesn't care if he comes across as abrasive or bigoted.    He also doesn't care if what he proposes makes any sense (building a Mexican wall and making Mexico pay for it, for instance).

There are some who find this outspokenness appealing (such as those who liked Sarah Palin).

But his problem is that he doesn't appeal to enough Republicans to get the nomination.  The Christian Right doesn't think he's really Christian (because, well, he isn't).  The Tea Partiers don't think he's really their guy either (because he isn't).  The mainstreamers don't think he's mainstream (because he isn't).  

At the end of the day, he might draw enough to be a spoiler in some early races (and maybe win a plurality), but once the other vote splitters drop out, a Jeb Bush or Scott Walker will appeal a lot more to primary voters.

The biggest scare for Repubs is whether he'll run as a 3rd party candidate.  In that case, he'll get enough votes to ensure a win by the Dems.","We're at an extremely polarized point in our nation's history and I think a lot of the dismissal comes from the fact that he's simply in the ""other"" party.  Democrats have branded him racist, sexist, etc. but is there a Republican they're not *also* branding as those things?  

Trump gets an extra heap of dismissal because he's also not exactly a Republican either.  There are a lot of people in the party who have a strong interest in making sure an outsider doesn't take the reigns. 

I think Jeb Bush is still his biggest competition overall.  Trump is the front runner because ridiculously early polling has him ahead but polling this early is notoriously unreliable and campaigning hasn't really started yet.  He's going to have to come up with a platform at some point to run on.

I wouldn't exactly call him a populist.  He certainly says some things some people want to hear but I think it's probably more accurate to call him the candidate for those fed up with career politicians.  Trumped up controversial statements have made headlines but I think his man attraction still is that he's an extremely successful businessman and not a guy who ran for his father's Senate seat 40 years ago.",A,A,"I would say that reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view.

This detailed explanation may help the original poster see potential weaknesses in Trump's candidacy that they may not have considered before. Reply B, on the other hand, focuses more on the polarization in politics and the dismissal of Trump as a result of being in the ""other"" party, which may not provide as much new information or insight for the original poster."
predict-explain,"**Firstly**, I'm using a throwaway because most people get really sensitive about this and my views are pretty much the antithesis of reddit (love Rand Paul, support Mens Rights, hate Pink Floyd).

**Secondly**, for context, I come from a wealthy family and have had very little experience with people from the lower socioeconomic spectrum, which probably shapes my view of the wealth ladder and how one climbs from rung to rung.

**MOST IMPORTANTLY**: I believe there are levels of poverty within the lower class and perhaps each level should be approached differently in this discussion. They are as follows:

1. *Physically/Mentally Unable to Work*: For all intents and purposes, this category should not be considered in my argument. They physically can't produce value and have little-to-no means to change that situation.
2. *Homeless/Welfare/Food Stamps*: Sometimes shit happens and people need help, but six months to a year should be enough time for anyone to get out of this category, yet many don't. I think [the 35% of Americans](http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/terence-p-jeffrey/354-percent-109631000-welfare) asking for handouts get so used to doing it that they forget how to be a valuable member to society and end up just sucking resources from the rest of the productive population which brings everybody down. 
3. *Crippling Debt*: I think people in this situation, regardless of their financial education, show a general lack of care to manage their money. It's not difficult to see if a degree will be worth the salary raise or if a loan will actually solve your current problems and their are more than enough resources online and in libraries to learn about proper finance skills in order to do so.
4. *Below the poverty threshold*: This is the general catch-all for everyone else in the lower class. I think problems like a botched health care system, over-imprisonment for drug sentences, and a generally rigged system such as having to pay to cash checks, not being able to afford the bulk deals, or own a home are factors that plague the lower class and rigidize social mobility, but it does not take away their opportunity to pull themselves up.

Every person starts somewhere in life, some get college education paid for, some join the family business and some are born an orphan without a bank account in their name. There's no question that some situations are more difficult than others, but there is also no question that examples of social mobility exist in both directions: rich kids wasting away a fortune and migrant farm workers becoming well-paid astronauts. 

I believe that as long as everyone has the freedom to climb the socioeconomic ladder rung by rung, that the only difference is between those that take the opportunity and those that don't and the reason why many people remain in poverty is because they lack the motivation to take the necessary steps, be it because they don't have peers pushing them to do so or because they would prefer to work a minimum wage job instead of applying for better positions--I can't say.

Although I was fortunate enough to start adulthood with no debt, I have had to work my ass off to get everything else I have and believe that anyone could be doing what I do and making as much money as I do regardless of their starting hand if they desire it.

EDIT: Great points, everyone. I am starting to see how success takes a combination of hard work and luck, the latter of which is invisible to most who are provided more of it. So far, the most convincing points have been the ones that have illustrated the poverty condition, and not just reminding me how lucky I am. The one thing I can't get past is that even if it is insurmountably more difficult to escape poverty, the fact that it IS possible makes me wonder if the institutions put in place making it difficult to make and keep money were removed if motivation would in fact be the only thing holding them back. I will have to come back a little later and read more thoroughly as I am at work now. Thanks for taking the time to respond.

**EDIT2: I awarded the delta to /u/caw81 way down at the bottom. His/her post was short, but provided a piece of evidence for the mental hardships of the impoverished. A belief is only as strong as its evidence in the logical mind and before his/her post I couldn't get the nagging argument of ""what if they just tried a little harder"" out of my head. I feel strange for ever feeling that way now.

What I don't like about this view is that it makes it seem so simple to get out of poverty.  ""'Just Do It' is all you need to fix your financial problems!""

Its hard to explain but poverty saps you.   Its a struggle just to keep your head above water and the waves are getting bigger and bigger and your are getting more and more tired.  

For example http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/29/poverty-mental-capacity-complex-tasks  

&gt;The cognitive deficit of being preoccupied with money problems was equivalent to a loss of 13 IQ points, losing an entire night's sleep or being a chronic alcoholic, according to the study. The authors say this could explain why poorer people are more likely to make mistakes or bad decisions that exacerbate their financial difficulties.

Its very hard to figure out what to do, organize yourself to do it, do it and then take advantage of it when you are sapped out.  Is the motivation you are asking of people unrealistic?","&gt; I come from a wealthy family and have had very little experience with people from the lower socioeconomic spectrum, which probably shapes my view of the wealth ladder and how one climbs from rung to rung.

predict-explain,"Hi guys!


To expand:

Although I would happily call someone who went from being a man to a woman (- for example) a woman to their face and when talking about them, I still don't believe they are truly that gender. Despite having surgery, having that mindset and having hormone treatment, I can't feel fully comfortable referring to them as a woman - just from a technical standpoint. I feel as though I'm lying to myself.


Disclaimer:

I am not homophobic or anything of the sort. I completely agree with people doing what they want to do and I completely believe people can be 'trapped' in the body of the opposite gender.","&gt;I feel as though I'm lying to myself.

Why? And what 'technical standpoint' are you referring to? Gender is mostly a surface level set of assumptions we make about other people to orient which social norms we should apply when interacting with them. Sure, biology has some influence and in a *very* few realms, might be a concern, but in terms of how we treat people in a day-to-day environment there's no reason trans people are not their gender.","Trans people are not uniformly the same as their supposed pre-transition sex. There are *biological* differences between trans people and their pre-trans sex. These include genetic differences, and differences in the brain.

**Genetic differences found only in trans individuals:**

MtF Trans individuals have been found to have genetic differences that cause their biology to bind testosterone differently than males.

&gt;The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.

**Brain structure differences found only in trans individuals:**

&gt;Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender.

and

&gt;The interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.

**Prenatal androgen exposure:**

&gt;Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females

So no, they were not ""technically their own original gender"", because their original biological characteristics did not conform to a typical member of their supposed previous sex in the first place.

Does this help change your view?

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism)",A,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B provides scientific evidence and research to support the argument that transgender individuals have biological differences that align more closely with their identified gender than their assigned sex at birth. By presenting this information, Reply B effectively challenges the original poster's belief that transgender individuals are not truly their identified gender from a technical standpoint. This evidence-based approach is more likely to persuade the original poster to reconsider their views on transgender identity."

When something is dismissed as anecdotal, it's usually because there's better evidence available. No one complains that it's anecdotal when you say you enjoy chocolate cake. It's when anecdotes are pushed in the face of more objective measures to the contrary that it becomes a concern, because then they become a potential tool for manipulating others or fooling yourself.","&gt; I understand that in an anecdotal case it is not scientific because it cannot be replicated and held to control standards, but I don't think this is grounds for dismissing the case as merely anecdotal and not worth mentioning.

One of those is a positive statement, and one of those is a normative statement.

""merely anecdotal"" -&gt; suggests that anecdotal evidence is not an acceptable standard of proof, which is a factual statement

""not worth mentioning"" -&gt; this is a normative statement. Depending on the context, anecdotal evidence may be worth mentioning, or it may not. Its context, however, has no bearing upon its essence as an insufficient standard of proof.

I can't really CMV you on whether or not you should like something (I don't yuck someone's yum), and I can't say that anecdotal evidence should never be mentioned because then I would be a colossal hypocrite.

The problem with this argument is that it is open ended and not grounded in a fact or idea.  It is as hard to dispute it as it is to dispute the comment *""I am scared""*.  

Whistle-blowers are essential to keep groups honest.  It doesn't mean that the whole system is better off gone.  It only means that there are more flaws than an entity would otherwise acknowledge.  I'm not familiar with everyone on the list, but considering that Obama immediately granted William Thompson immunity from any crimes for testifying clearly indicates that we're not looking at a conspiracy. He spoke out and he was encouraged to do so.

&gt;  Now I'm not antivaccine (although I haven't been immunized yet) I'm just not pro vaccine. I haven't seen enough to discredit this dark side of things and show undoubtedly that vaccinations are the way to go.


As /u/amazingmrbrock pointed out in what might be deemed *the laziest CMV comment in history* there's more at stake than what you can plainly see.  Specifically Herd Immunity.  That means that we are communally protected from diseases because they are less prevalent.  So for instance, babies younger than 1 year old or the elderly with weakened immune systems may not be able to be vaccinated.  However the lack of prevalence of the disease in society makes it that they are still safe.  So being vaccinated is not just about saving your life but it is about saving the lives of others around you.


Separately, it is important not to look at public policy from an empirical perspective.  Everyone will always know of a story about someone who suffered in some way.  This only points out that a system is not perfect, which was never really in contention. The only question is if the system is better than the lack of a system.  Which *statistics* do a much better job at proving.  Looking at the [Anti-vaccine Body count](http://www.antivaccinebodycount.com/Anti-Vaccine_Body_Count/Home.html) we can see staggering numbers in preventable diseases and deaths.  

If vaccines caused autism or had similar effects, then surely it would be measurable in a similar way.  We could reconcile that data against each other.  But in the absence of facts, horror stories take it's place.  I can see how gory details are more moving than a chart, but it doesn't make them more accurate.","The problem is there are thousands of vaccines in the world, all with their own specific goal, their own specific ingredients and therefor their own specific interaction with the human body. Saying vaccinating is a bad idea because some may or may not cause negative side effects is akin to saying that eating is a bad idea because some people have bad reactions to certain foods. It is nonsensical.

Yes, there are undoubtebly some horror stories out there about cases where vaccination may or may not have played a role. And that is absolutely sad and horrible for the parents involved. But the inevitable result of introducing a foreign object (the vaccine) into the human body is that somebody, somewhere is going to have an adverse reaction to this. In the end, life itself is inherently risky and we can never eliminate all risks. I myself am terribly allergic to walnuts. Give me a handful and I'll be dead before you can call an ambulance. In the US alone it is estimated there are over 15 million people with food allergies (1 in 20), yet how many parents will have their children tested before giving them their first peanut butter? I would guess none. Why? Because the risk is thought to be minimal. Yes, there might be countless horror stories, and some of these might even be true, but billions of people have been vaccinated over the years. Compared to that number, even if all these stories are true, means that there is virtually no risk whatsoever. A child is far more likely to die from eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich than from getting complications from vaccinations.

Now a lot has already been said about the actual health dangers to vaccinations, I could add to it, but instead I'll direct you to a very informative video by Potholer54:

predict-explain,"With the advent of self-driving vehicles, the unavoidable will become clear: people are terrible drivers, and operating your own car is unacceptably reckless if a better alternative exists.  I see the coming timeline like this: (copied from a reply to another post)  

&gt;2-5 years: The last major technological hurdles (driving in rural/poorly documented areas, driving in adverse conditions, cost) are resolved. Cars are now demonstratively better drivers than humans in all situations. (note: may be a very liberal estimate.)  
4-6 years: The first round of legal cases involving driverless cars is settled, producing a precedent that makes driving your own car very risky. A collision between two vehicles, one self driving the other not, almost always results in fault to the driver. Causing an accident while operating a car with unused self-driving capability makes drivers extremely vulnerable to being sued.  
5-10 years: Safety studies, overwhelmingly favorable to self-driving cars, lead to the option becoming mandatory on all new vehicles. insurance companies, burned by litigation, offer premium rates to those who never switch off the driverless option, while increasing rates on drivers who elect to operate their cars manually. Soon the difference between these rates becomes enormous.  
10-15 years: Commercial driving is entirely automated. Cabs, buses, trucks, trains, ""driver"" becomes an obsolete profession. The savings in both wages and liability is simply too tremendous to allow any non-automated fleet to remain competitive.  
15-20 years: Studies conclusively show that the only traffic casualties that still occur are exclusively due to human operator error. It becomes evident that driving your own car is unthinkably dangerous, like drunk driving at night with no headlights or seatbelts. Safety laws are passed that effectively outlaw operating your own vehicle.   
  
By the time my nephew is 15-16, controlling a car will be something that only hobbyists do, and never on public roads.  Very few cars will be privately owned, rather they will be operated by private or municipal transportation services.

With all automated mechanical systems, it's important to have fail-safes to allow human intervention in the case of emergencies that are not anticipated by the software.  

Nowadays, auto-pilot can fly airlines pretty much from gate-to-gate.  The reason that we don't do this is that the software cannot anticipate **all** possible emergency situations and pilot intuition cannot be replaced.  

I believe the same thing will ring true with self-driving cars.  Eventually, they will take over a majority of our driving, but I think that it'll be a long time before we have self-driving cars that cannot be manually controlled.","While I agree with you that safe-driving cars will likely eventually become mainstream, I'm not sure where you got your time line from because it seems grossly exaggerated. There is no way that self-driving cars are going to replace human-driven cars in 16 years.

predict-explain,"Let me start off by saying that I am not against legal immigration in anyway, and am only against illegal immigration. I believe that illegal immigrants should not be given amnesty for plenty of reasons.

A) They broke the law, and should be punished, not rewarded, for doing so. There are legal ways to immigrate into the US, and just because it is harder to do so does not mean you can ignore the law when it is convenient. 

B) Illegal immigration depresses wages and lowers working conditions. They are willing to work for less, and are much less likely to complain when they are abused. Many businesses take advantage of such people to save costs, and treat their illegal immigrant workers unfairly. 

C) The people coming in negatively effect the community by committing crime. According to USA Today, [they represent just 3.5% of the U.S. population, undocumented immigrants represented 7% of federal prison sentences following convictions on charges of sexual abuse, 9% of murders, 12% of assaults and 30% of kidnappings in 2013.
](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/16/voices-gomez-undocumented-immigrant-crime-san-francisco-shooting/30159479/) 

**EDIT** I only googled ""how much crime to illegal immigrants commit"" and only looked at the first statistic I found in the article, so I do concede this point after reading my own source more clearly, since it states later in the article that
""There's no evidence that immigrants are either more or less likely to commit crimes than anyone else in the population,"" Janice Kephart, a CIS researcher, said last week on the PBS NewsHour.


D) Most importantly, by not having a tough stance on illegal immigration, it further encourages illegal immigration. There is always going to be motivation for illegal immigration, so as a country, we should do our best to discourage that behavior. By not actively discouraging illegal immigration, people would be stupid not to try to illegally immigrate.


**EDIT:**
My view has changed in the sense that I no longer believe that all illegal immigrants should be deported as soon as possible, and you can see my post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3gt76g/cmv_illegal_immigrants_should_be_deported_and_not/cu1b3o9)

They work in certain jobs that traditional Americans don't. 

Also, no matter what laws we place, we will never defeat the massive amount of economic incentive for people to come over here. If Americans could make far, far, far more moving to Canada we would make the trip legal or not. 

So the fact that we have job sectors that require illegal work and they will simply come over anyway because of economic incentive, what we need is a much stronger guest worker program.  

There are people who would love to work the season an then go back to their home countries. Our current laws make this impossible. Once you're here you stay. 

If we had a solid guest worker program it would solve a fair amount of problems.

This strikes me as, and I'm going to be honest here, unbearably naive and simplistic.

First of all , ""They broke the law and should be punished.""

Ok, but you haven't explained why that punishment *has* to be deportation. Not only is it going to cost the US billions of dollars tracking down and deporting 11 million people, it leaves off the table other methods of punishment. Punishments that could include:

Paying a large fine to the taxpayers

Community service

Larger amount of paycheck going to payroll taxes (social security)

Lower on the tier list for government job prospects

Just deporting them all isn't good for the country. Certainly not as good a deal as having them pay us money. This also doesn't deal with the problem that most of the jobs they do Americans don't wan to do anyway. And this:

&gt; There are legal ways to immigrate into the US, and just because it is harder to do so does not mean you can ignore the law when it is convenient.

I mean, come on. I hate calling people out but this is just textbook ""American not realizing how good they have it.""

If a guy has a hungry family, he isn't just breaking the law because it is ""convenient."" He's not shoplifting his favorite pair of sneakers. They are taking a **huge** risk coming here, and working a tremendous amount (I believe the average work week for an illegal immigrant is well over 50 hours..close to 60) in order to **not starve.** Honestly, if I was in their position I would do the same thing. Do you really expect people to just say, ""Oh, since it is against the law for me to climb that fence, me and my family are just gonna starve."" Fuck that. Sending them back because they ""broke a law"" is just flat out immoral. They had to be pretty desperate to take all those risks, uproot themselves from their homes, and move their whole family to a foreign country where they don't even speak the language.

&gt; B) Illegal immigration depresses wages and lowers working conditions. They are willing to work for less, and are much less likely to complain when they are abused. Many businesses take advantage of such people to save costs, and treat their illegal immigrant workers unfairly.

Ironically, these problems would all be solved if they were given amnesty.

As for your crime stats, I'm pretty sure those are misleading / cherrypicked, but I'm not sure so I cannot dispute it. However, it is silly to deport *all* illegals.

This perception is incorrect but is still commonplace. I believe that the Bush years will be viewed similarly by future generations for the following reasons:

The much disputed election in Florida was a huge challenge to the world's second-largest democracy. Having the Supreme Court effectively appoint a president upon party lines significantly hurt faith in the US political process and led to the polarization that has led to the Do-Nothing Congresses of 2006-2008 and 2010-.

Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq eroded the brief period of global consensus that saw countries from Iran to Russia united in sympathy with the USA against Al-Qaeda. I'm not saying we would be at world peace thereafter, but we could have taken advantage of that unity to seriously reduce international conflict.

Climate change. Need I say more? The Bush years saw inaction on global climate change that has endangered every country on earth.

Imperialism. The expansion of the War on Terror to Iraq and other groups was correlated with a rise of police militarization (in the US) and espionage (globally) and led to the installation of treasonous quisling governments around Europe.

Erosion in quality of living. In addition to the phony ""development"" of countries like China and India, Western countries have seen a large absolute drop in well-being due to the financial crisis of the Bush years, a drop which treaties like TPP and TTIP may well enshrine into law.

TL;DR: If the world is a dystopia in 2200, George W. Bush will be (rightfully or not) blamed.

How?  When has something like that ever happened?  In reality, there was a large body of international opinion that the US should not even go into Afghanistan after Al Queda.  Many foreign governments were on board with it, but their peoples weren't.  If we'd never gone into Iraq all the same people would still hate us.

The peaceful transition of power, particularly in an unsatisfying way (and whichever way it went, half the country was going to be unsatisfied) is still relatively rare in the world.  I'm far more concerned about Citizens United or gutting the Voting Rights Act, which I think we have a much greater impact on elections and the governance than the Bush v. Gore where I can at least understand the votes.

**Squandered Opportunity for peace**  Agreed, we dropped the ball on this one.  But it wouldn't have stopped Russia's love of imperialism.  It wouldn't have stopped Muslim extremism in the Middle East.  Maybe an FDR could have forged something out of it - but Gore wasn't talented enough of a politician to create a coalition of nations dedicated to wiping out the poverty and ignorance that leads to extremism.  And it was early enough in his term that he wouldn't have the skills, relationships or staff capable of helping him accomplish this.

**Climate change** Congress was not going to pass legislation that would hobble the US economy for the sake of the future.  The threat isn't immediate enough (or perceived as certain enough by most people) for people to support the sort of extreme action that would be required.  Yes, Gore would have worked to reduce our speed in that direction, but he alone couldn't have made a significant enough difference.  He wasn't charismatic enough.  Plus, post 9/11, people would have had other priorities.

**Imperialism**.  Americans were scared shitless after 9/11.  Gore would have been forced to respond.  Likely, as a democrat, he's be under huge pressure to not ""be soft"" on terrorism.  I don't think he would have invaded Iraq, but probably would have done so in Afghanistan.  He would have also taken similar steps on domestic spying.  Remember, this is a guy whose wife lead the ""parental advisory warning on CD's"" movement - not a huge civil libertarian.

**Economic Instability** This can't all be pinned on Bush by a long shot.  [NPR did a great series](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money) on how the global economic boom created this unprecedented pile of money that needed to be invested somewhere, which lead to the popularity of ""mortgage-backed securities"", which lead to stupid loans, which lead to the global economic collapse.

There's no question that the amount of [disposable income in countries like China](http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/26/news/economy/china-middle-class/) has increased dramatically, and poverty has decreased.

Yes, the distribution of wealth is still screwed, but there is vastly more wealth, which is benefiting many poorer countries.

**TL;DR: it was a time of missed opportunities, and some screw ups, but I don't think it was a tipping point as you suggest, and that even had Gore been elected, things wouldn't have been dramatically different.**",B,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more nuanced and balanced perspective on the impact of the Bush years, acknowledging both the missed opportunities and the screw-ups, while also pointing out that the situation was more complex and not solely the fault of George W. Bush. Additionally, Reply B offers counterarguments to the original poster's points in a more logical and structured manner, addressing each point individually.

They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?

Legally, police aren't allowed to shoot someone with their gun if they don't intend to kill them. If they shoot, then they must intend to kill. 

&gt; I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing him/her, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen.

The problem is different people can resist these weapons to different degrees. Police do use these weapons, and you can see videos online where the results range from having no effect all the way to killing people. The problem is there's no way to guarantee the weapon will stun, but also not kill them.","Have you ever seen an anesthesiologist's paycheck? They get paid a lot, and a huge portion of what they get paid goes straight to malpractice insurance. This is because it's not easy to knock someone out, and it's even harder to do it without hurting or killing them. 

I'm no expert on tranquilizers but I know they are not the instant knock out guns movies make them appear to be. You have to get the drug in their system and it needs time to work. Time a person could use any number of ways, some dangerous.

Also, more importantly in my opinion, you're putting the person shot a risk. You're injecting an unfamiliar drug into their system. They could be allergic, or it could have an averse reaction with some other legal or illegal drug that they're taking. It could hurt them, cause permanent damage, or even kill them.

predict-explain,"A multitude of films have twists in the plot, for example Gone Girl, Memento, a lot of films of M. Night Shyamalan, the Usual Suspects, Shutter Island, Fight club, well I can go on and on. [Here is a list of 100 twists](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070836741/). 

It usually consists of a plot that advances, but with hidden information not completely revealed yet. When the information is revealed, it will heighten the liking of the plot. It feels 'Mind blowing', the movie instantly goes deeper, it is suddenly a more complex movie, and twists are ideal for deep analysis and allegories. 

Adding a twist to a plot can make it everyone say 'Wow' and that one guy say: 'I knew it all along'. 

I think an analogy of showing why people like this so much, because it is abit like being in the plato's cave and then suddenly showing the light and deeper meaning. 

However, and this is my point, it is a simple and cheap way to make the movie much smarter than it initially was. I think there is also a high amount of plot twist movies in the IMDB top 250 (By no means a standard, but a good representative what is liked by movie-goers). Adding a well written plot twist makes a movie ripe for people to laud it, even though it is done to dead.

Basically my point is that it is a too simple way to make a movie 'smarter' and an overdone method of 'blowing peoples minds'. It instantly adds points for movie-goers. 

As I said in the title, my point is not that is a non-amusing 'plot device'. But it is a simple way to add layers in a movie. 

While watching a movie myself I always seem to like a twist (I thought Gone Girl did this very well and it sincerely surprised me) but afterwards when I am out of the cinema and more rational again I think 'hmm, just another twistmovie'. And apart from the twist nothing really interesting going on.

A well regarded movie where I didn't like the twist was 'The Usual Suspects'. The cinematography and acting was obviously well done, but only looking at the plot I thought it wasn't impressive taking away the twist. I am probably triggering now a couple readers, for that I am sorry. However this is not a critique of this movie, but more of an example.

I also think this is the reason why M. Night Shyamalan was so well recieved in the start of his career and now he is way less regarded than at that time. Because he does it all the time, and then it surfaces that it is a cheap movie 'plot device'. If he did it only once or twice people wouldn't have noticed it significantly.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","A good twist is really hard to pull off, because it has to walk a very thin line. If it's too predictable, then it's not a twist at all; if it's not predictable enough, then it's just going to seem silly (e.g. If, for example, LOTR had a plot twist where Sam was actually Saruman in disguise the whole time, absolutely no one would see that coming - but that's because it's a bloody stupid idea that makes absolutely no sense).


So pulling a twist off well is a matter of feeding the audience just enough foreshadowing that they have an idea of what's coming, but not so much that they're bored when it actually happens. In other words, a good twist feeds more off suspense than surprise.


I would say that The Usual Suspects is an example of a bad twist. It's a twist that ends up invalidating a good chunk of what you've seen. In other words, it's a twist that reveals that the movie has been lying to you. 


IMHO Inception is a better twist, because it relies more on suspense than surprise. The possibility of being trapped in a dream is raised quite a few times. This sounds a few bells in the audience's mind: ""Okay, not being able to distinguish between dreams and reality seems like a major theme here, that'll probably be relevant to the plot later."" So we have a sense, a feeling, that maybe Dom is more embroiled in this world of dreams than he thinks. When we learn about what really happened with his wife, or see the top spinning at the end, it's a good twist because it's something that's been germinating in our minds for a while. We look at that and say ""Aha! I knew that would come into play somehow, I just didn't know how or when."" 


Hitchcock often spoke of the value of suspense over surprise. One of my favourite examples of this is him discussing a bombing. If you have a five minute scene where two people are having a conversation at a table, then a bomb under the table explodes, the audience is completely shocked - but only briefly. If, however, you start the scene with someone planting the bomb then sneaking out, and during the course of the conversation cut to the bomb ticking down, then the entire conversation people are on the edge of their seats. The dialogue is cast in a whole new light, knowing that there's something about to happen. Moreover, it fuses in a bit of uncertainty: Will the bomb explode? Will they find it in time? If they find it, how will they defuse it? etc.


A good twist is the same way. A twist that no one sees coming is a bad twist. Everyone's shocked when it happens - for about thirty seconds. A good twist is one that is slowly and gradually introduced, to build suspense. People are fairly certain that something will happen, but they don't know how, or why, or when. 


For example: Betrayal. You've got a film where a group of people are working to accomplish something. One of the people on the team is a traitor. A bad twist is one where, at the climax of the film, the traitor is suddenly revealed. A better twist is one where we find out part way through the movie that there's a traitor on the team, but we don't know who. This is still revealed at the end, but we spend the rest of the movie thinking ""Hmmm, okay how and why will the betrayal happen? Who will be the traitor?"" Everything is cast in the light of this knowledge that someone is going to betray the rest of the team. We may guess right, we may not, but either way (if it's a good movie) we're on the edge of our seats right up until the last minute, waiting to find out the exact circumstances of the twist we already kinda know.


tl;dr A bad twist is something that takes us by complete surprise; a good twist is one that provides new context, nuance, and depth to the rest of the movie.","Twists are done because they are intended to be a plot development or character reveal the audience would not expect to happen. A twist fails completely when it is predictable. When the story is built in a way that makes you think something is going to happen; but in fact, something you never expected occurs, you feel more engaged in the story because it is legitimately unpredictable. There's a reason twists aren't typically revealed until halfway or three quarters of the way through a movie, and that's because a twist revealed too early has no time to subvert your expectations-while one revealed too late has no legitimate impact on the rest of the story. 

No doubt some movies use twists to try to appear ""smart,"" but it has an actual purpose from a storytelling perspective in keeping things atypical.",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a detailed explanation of what makes a good twist, emphasizing the importance of suspense over surprise. It uses examples and analogies to illustrate its points, making it easier for the original poster to understand why twists are important in storytelling. Additionally, Reply A acknowledges the flaws in certain twists, such as those that invalidate the rest of the movie, which aligns with the original poster's concerns about twists being overused as a cheap plot device. 

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the unpredictability of twists and their purpose in storytelling. While it does touch on the importance of twists being unexpected, it lacks the depth and analysis provided in Reply A. 

Overall, Reply A presents a more thorough and well-argued perspective on twists in movies, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"A few points clarifying my view:

* By primary language, I mean either *official* language (i.e. English or French in Canada) or the language most spoken by the people in that country (i.e. English in America)

* I don't expect fluency. My mother has lived in Canada for almost twenty years now and she still has trouble sometimes. My view is that all immigrants should strive for at the very least an [intermediate](http://www.londonschool.com/level-scale/) mastery. 

* My one exception would be if an immigrant does not have the financial capability to pay for lessons in the language of the country they've moved to. However, in Canada at least, free English lessons are offered to new immigrants, so I wouldn't see any reason to not learn the language here. 

Not learning the primary language of the country they've moved to encourages segregation and often leads to racial or cultural tension. By refusing to learn the primary language to an acceptable extent, they're showing a blatant refusal to adapt even a little to their new country's culture. Even if you're living in an area where you could live your entire life speaking your mother tongue, it doesn't make sense to not at least do the bare minimum to adapt. What's the point of coming all the way to another country if you're not going to respect it? Multiculturalism is wonderful and should be valued, but refusing to learn the country's language and creating enclaves is *preventing* multiculturalism.

3.saying it was justified trivialises the death, decision caused by them and ignores the moral imprecations of the event.(this is a observation made on reddit) that in discussions people are more focused in saying it is justified and giving the same reasons, rather than actually thinking about the event or have any meaningful decision .

People who think so, especially via religion, has their head up their asses. in my opinion

War is never a morale action, it just what we deem a necessary action.

The nuclear bombing was justifiable from the point of view of a country fighting a war. It would have done the most, in terms of the war effort. for the least resources (time, materials, energy, man power, and human lives - on their own country's side)

tl;rl No, in the grand scheme of things, as human beings; no, the bombing was not morally justifiable.
From the point of view of a country fighting another country by means of violence; yes, it was economically justifiable.","&gt; the argument ""but more people would have been killed!"" is not valid as we will never know if more people were saved, but more importantly if we can't tell if more people were saved how would the people at the time know ?

You're right to point out both that at the time of the decision, we didn't know what would happen, and that even know, we have no good way of knowing what would have happened.

But this uncertainty cuts both ways. Harry Truman did not know what would have happened if he didn't act. But if this means dropping the bombs ""can't be justified"", then couldn't you say the same if he hadn't dropped the bombs? If he hadn't gave the order, and even more hundreds of thousands of lives were lost, couldn't you just as easily say that his decision to *not* drop the bombs ""can't be justified"" because he didn't know what would happen?

This is just a fundamental problem of making decisions with limited information. And unfortunately, making those sorts of decisions is literally what the president's job is.

So the questions I would ask when evaluating such an action involve imagining what other people (myself included) would do in his situation. And to really think about that, you have to put yourself in his position. You are responsible for the lives of millions of Americans. There's a war going on right now with people fighting and dying, and you don't know how its going to end. You don't know how many more of your people are going to fight and die and suffer because of your decisions. And now you are given the opportunity to end it all, but not without a cost. You don't know what will happen, but you kind of just have to do the math based on your best assessment of the situation. I don't think it was a decision that was made lightly. We'll never know if it was ""right"", but I think given the situation at the time, it was reasonable. I don't know if that counts as ""being justified"" to you, but its enough for me not to condemn Harry Truman as a mass murderer.",A,A,"I would say Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more nuanced and thoughtful analysis of the decision to drop the atomic bombs on Japan. It acknowledges the uncertainty and difficult decision-making process that Truman faced, and presents a compelling argument for why the decision, while not morally clear-cut, was reasonable given the circumstances. 

On the other hand, Reply A takes a more absolute stance on the morality of war and the bombing, which may not resonate as well with someone who is looking for a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in such a decision. 

Overall, Reply B's consideration of the context and the challenges faced by Truman in making the decision makes it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games.

All other ideas on curbing gun violence doesn't seem to have the aspects of deincentification and directness that posting armed guards at schools has. That's not to say that ideas are wrong but adding this idea of armed guards to their respective platforms would, in my opinion, help curb school violence better than any of these opinions could individually.

Additionally, Reply B highlights the benefits of obtaining a college degree, such as higher average wages and lower unemployment rates, which could make taking out loans to pay for college a worthwhile investment. 

On the other hand, while Reply A makes a valid point about the value of essential trades that do not require a college degree, it does not directly address the original poster's concerns about the rising cost of college tuition and the burden of student loan debt. Reply B's evidence-based argument is more likely to persuade the original poster to reconsider their views on the issue."
predict-explain,"Cigarettes are the leading cause of preventable death, responsible for roughly 480,000 deaths per year in the US. 41,000 of those deaths aren't even those of users -- they are the deaths of those exposed to secondhand smoke. If you use the drug (nicotine), it can directly affect the health of those close to you. 

Smoking harms nearly every organ in the body, causing cancer and disease. Cigarettes are extremely addictive and many people can't quit even if they try.

Yet other drugs pose less threats and have a much lower or even a nonexistent fatality rate. They certainly aren't killing 1,300 people per day. 

Can you imagine if an illegal drug killed over 1,000 people everyday, users and nonusers? There would be political crusades.

For all illicit drugs combined, the number of resulting deaths were about 17,000 in 2013. For all drugs combined -- legal and illegal -- that number jumped to about 46,500 for that same year. That's an extra 29,500 deaths from legal drugs.

Cigarettes cause 10x more deaths per year than all the drugs in the US.

Why are we pouring so much time, resources and money into the Drug War to keep these *super dangerous* illegal drugs out of the hands of the American public such as marijuana (easy argument, 0 deaths) or even heroin (much more difficult argument, ~6,000 deaths in 2013) when cigarettes are so acceptable? 

Cigarettes kill nearly half a million people per year and are the direct cause for serious health issues and reduced lifespan. They are highly addictive. If the objective of the War on Drugs is to keep people safe and not addicted to drugs, how can we rationalize this continuing support of cigarettes while stigmatizing the use of other, less harmful drugs? 

- - -

**Reasons I think we overlook this high fatality rate...**

* culture and ingrained public perception of acceptance. 

Cigarettes used to be advertised as good for you and everybody knows somebody who smokes. Smoking is not something you necessarily have to hide. Jobs don't (generally) screen for cigarette smokers.

* in the eyes of the public, cigarettes aren't really ""drugs"" (i.e. they don't alter your state of consciousness; they don't get you high)

An 18 year old can legally buy as many packs of cigarettes as they want.  In the US, they can't even do that with alcohol (which gets you drunk). In states with legal marijuana, you also have to be 21 to buy/consume. 

* cigarettes don't cause immediate death. (shortsightedness)

You don't overdose on nicotine. Instead, cigarettes slowly kill you so there is no instant connection between cigarettes and death. For example, a heroin OD would be an instant ""drugs kill you."" If you smoke a cigarette, you know you aren't risking your life right that second.

**What are some other reasons we overlook this fatality rate and continue to socially and legislatively accept cigarettes?**

Maybe your premise is wrong about the objective of the War on Drugs. The War on Drugs came from the Nixon administration, with the *advertised* purpose ostensibly being to keep people safe and not addicted to drugs. But according to John Ehrlichman, who was counsel and Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs under Richard Nixon, the real purpose was different. Here is an excerpt from an interview with Dan Baum for the book ""Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure"":

&gt;The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar Left, and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black. But by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.

According to the book, the rationale for the war on drugs was to target people who were not likely to vote for Nixon: 

&gt;The young, the poor, and the black. Nixon couldn't make it illegal to be young, poor, or black, but he could crack down hard on the illegal drug identified with the counterculture.

If the book is right, acceptance of cigarettes falls in line exactly with the War on Drugs.","I don't disagree with your claim that the war on drugs is stupid (I choose to believe that's your claim, and I agree).  

But to answer your hypothesis about why we're mysteriously okay with cigarettes, it's because it's a lot easier to keep something away from people than it is to TAKE something away from people.  If the default stance on marijuana was already that it was legal, it'd still be legal everywhere and you wouldn't be seeing many people trying to get it banned.  Same as alcohol.  

But when something is *already* illegal, it's a lot easier to keep it that way.  If cigarettes were illegal already, they'd likely be staying that way, for exactly the reasons you mentioned.  People would be saying ""Why on earth should we legalize these things?  We haven't even legalized stuff that's far less dangerous!""",A,A,"I would say reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because reply A provides historical context and insight into the true motivations behind the War on Drugs, suggesting that the acceptance of cigarettes falls in line with the agenda of targeting certain demographics rather than genuinely aiming to keep people safe and not addicted to drugs. This perspective challenges the original poster's premise and raises questions about the underlying reasons for the acceptance of cigarettes despite their high fatality rate. Reply A also includes a direct quote and a specific example to support its argument, adding credibility to the response. On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the practicality of legalizing or banning substances based on their current legal status, which may not directly address the original poster's concerns about the acceptance of cigarettes."
predict-explain,"Bernie Sanders is running a campaign on promises like free college and getting money out of politics. Nearly everything I've heard his campaign promise requires congressional action. As a congressman Bernie Sanders knows that.

From the [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/26/bernie-sanders-2016_n_7446570.html) : ""Among the specific items on his campaign platform include establishing a $15 minimum wage, closing the gender pay gap, investing $1 trillion over five years to rebuild infrastructure, and overturning the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision""

Each of those things requires new legislation. With 16 years in the House and 2 terms in the Senate Sanders should be familiar with the limits of each branch of government. This makes me think he knows he can't win so he is recklessly promising absurd things. When he inevitably loses and the winning candidate fails to deliver on the impossible goals he set out he can say ""I would have done it differently"" but we should know better. Even if he wins, he'll blame Congress for blocking his agenda. The only way he can possibly accomplish anything he promises is if 1) He wins the presidential election, 2) Like-minded democrats win a majority in BOTH houses of congress. Which, while it would be cool, is only possible in some incredibly unlikely fantasy land.

predict-explain,"I think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at the keys and often hunting and pecking. I personally consider this a major problem because I think it is holding us back to some extent.

Some points that I use to support this argument:

1. Faster typing = more productivity, businesses would benefit. You could do more paperwork, more homework, anything on the computer. I'd argue that if everybody could type, we'd all have more free time as well, or at the very least GDP would increase as we get more work done in less time. 

2. It's useful for personal and professional activities: Even if all you do is type posts on facebook and write an email to your grandkids, knowing how to type will help you.

3. It's easy to learn. It's all muscle memory, and if you practiced for an hour a day you'd be good in a month. Plus there are programs galore for it. 

So, my view is that if university required you to know how to touch-type, perhaps with a modest WPM test on entry, or at least a freshman-year course, people would be forced to learn it and would become better typists, thus benefiting everyone down the line. 

Why university? Because minimum wage workers don't usually need to type on a computer, making it less necessary at the high school level. Also, in university, you'll be typing a hell of a lot. I don't care what course you take, you'll need to type up essays and ultimately a thesis paper. 

Am I overblowing this? To quote the great Mugatu, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. To me it's at least as important as learning how to write with a pen these days. I'd just like to understand why society currently seems to place no value in this skill, and that maybe I'm overreacting. 

**Edit 1**

Well, thanks for all the comments, it's been a very interesting discussion so far. 

The argument that's hanging onto me the most is that the keyboard may become obsolete, but I can't see that happening soon enough to justify ignoring a useful skill.

For those who point out that we can learn it of our own free will and it's not the university's place, I feel that the long-term benefits of such a policy change benefit us in the long term. Universities often require you to study other things they feel are beneficial, such as learning another language (which is often taught inadequately), so I don't feel that it's outside the potential scope of a university to require typing.

And for those pointing out that it isn't worth the time, I maintain that learning costs next to nothing, and it saves you time over the course of your life if you add up every time you type.

**Edit 2, View Changed**

/u/cheeseboyardee made the point that not everyone learns at the same rate and some people may not be able to learn to type well, and thus mandating it could exclude otherwise capable people. 

Thanks for all the posts and cordial discussion.

If you're writing so quickly that you're limited by your WPM, you're probably not being very concise. For example it takes me about 10-20 hours to write a 3000 word paper. 

Based on your reasoning, speed reading would be 100x more useful than being able to type fast. Would you support a mandatory speed reading class for everyone?","In middle and high school my school mandated typing classes. Typing ""the quick fox jumped over the lazy brown dog"" over and over again for an entire week with a piece of paper covering the keyboard. 

I topped out at about 30 WPM after 10 weeks of the course with more typos and misplaced spaces than are appropriate. (About 20 WPM if I was copying text.)

By looking at the keyboard I actually slow my mind down to focus on the word I am typing at the moment instead of getting ahead of myself. Moves me up to 40-50 wpm with fewer mistakes. To catch up to how fast the words go through my head I would need to be closer to my reading speed (300ish WPM).  The speed difference trying to touch type is unbearable, the increase in allowing myself to see the keyboard helps make it bearable. 

Offering touch typing courses is going to be a good idea. 

Requiring it for admission is not. Especially in countries that have massive disparities between school districts in terms of the availability of technology. Not every student has regular prolonged access to a keyboard or the internet in order to develop that skill. 

Saying anything is ""Easy to learn"" leaves off the second half of that sentence. Which is ""...For me."" Other people have different skills and abilities and learn different skills at different rates. Even something as simple as singing a simple tune is nearly impossible for some.",B,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a personal anecdote and explanation of why touch typing may not work for everyone, highlighting the fact that people have different learning speeds and abilities. The user also brings up the issue of disparities in access to technology and resources, which could make it difficult for some students to learn touch typing. This response takes a more nuanced approach to the issue and addresses the potential challenges and limitations of mandating touch typing courses. 

In contrast, Reply A focuses on a different skill (speed reading) and argues that speed in typing may not necessarily be the most important factor. While this is a valid point, it doesn't directly address the original poster's arguments about the benefits of touch typing and the potential impact on productivity. 

Overall, Reply B provides a more comprehensive and thoughtful response that takes into account different perspectives and potential barriers to mandating touch typing courses."
predict-explain,"I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly interactions with civilians when there is no clear or present danger present. I've seen a few videos on the internet of cops dancing at block parties or playing a short round of cards in a park but none have gone viral like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl972jf8cs4) of an NYPD officer dancing at the NYC LGBT pride parade this past weekend. The general consensus is polarized; some people like myself are perfectly fine, even happy, that some officers are finding enjoyment and positive interactions with civilians in their day-to-day work rather than hostility and aggression; others feel that this interaction was completely unprofessional and that the officer should be fired or at least punished.

I believe that the officer shouldn't face any punishment for simply dancing with a civilian for less than 20 seconds at a parade with clearly no imminent threat or danger present. My logic behind this is that many officers won't be punished for using excessive force or even wrongfully killing someone, so why should an officer be punished for taking 20 seconds to dance with a friendly civilian at a parade. Even if we lived in a world where excessively violent officers were rightfully punished, I would still be angry if this cop were to be punished for dancing at a parade.

What if (and this isn't beyond the scope of ""reasonably possible"" things) while you weren't paying attention because of this, someone came up and started shooting at the crowd? It was your job to keep them safe and because you weren't paying attention, more people could have potentially been hurt? Is that likely? No, but you never know when things like that will happen so you need to be concentrating on your job.

It isn't a job-ending offense in my opinion, but people get punished for goofing off on the job all the time. It isn't really relevant that there have been worse offenses committed by police, what matters is whether his conduct was in line with what he should have been doing, and it wasn't. It was a harmless thing, but the reason you enforce conduct codes is because you never know when some seemingly ""harmless"" thing is going to lead to or allow something not so harmless to happen. 

Some punishment is fair, but it isn't a huge issue. He shouldn't lose his job but his conduct was not professional and it is totally fair to maintain a higher standard of professionalism by enforcing rules regarding conduct when on duty.

EDIT: To address several people who have mentioned this, yes obviously there is some degree of discretion involved as to what constituted ""too distracted"" and it is nice to see officers interacting positively with the community. I'm just laying out the reasoning for why this could potentially be considered an offense while on the job. As I said, it wasn't a huge deal, but you have to draw the line somewhere between ""OK behavior"" and ""distracted while on the job"", even if it isn't *likely* that anything would have happened in those 15 or 20 seconds. It's fair to say that a high-profile, controversial (to some) event like this could *potentially* break out into something that the police would need to interject into and that is why I think the rationale holds up, even if it's just a slap on the wrist and a warning to ""not do that next time"".","If some cops didn't commit sexual assault while on duty then mild simulated grinding wouldn't perhaps be so problematic.  But when cops express themselves even mildly as sexual beings while on duty, while armed, and while in the position to really wreck someone's life... then even mildly suggestive acts carry more weight and only serve to remind the public (for better and/or worse) of the implications.  

We all know that what happened in this video wasn't the most heinous thing that an officer has ever done.  Not even by a long shot.  In fact, it was arguably rather harmless.  But in the context of many heinous actions committed by the police overall... even slightly questionable actions should be considered with more weight.  

And the fact that some cops act like decent/typical human beings sometimes doesn't dispel the reality of what police departments in general do as a whole.  A few dancing cops doesn't change the harsh reality of what they they more regularly do on a daily basis -- and people shouldn't be confused into thinking that it's all fun and games with them.  If you try dancing up all friendly with a cop in most situations... you're probably not going to have such a good time.",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a logical argument for why the officer's conduct, while not a major offense, was still unprofessional and potentially could have put others at risk. The user acknowledges that it wasn't a huge deal but still argues for maintaining a higher standard of professionalism while on duty. They also address the potential consequences of being distracted while on the job, even if nothing serious happened in those 15-20 seconds. This user presents a balanced perspective on the situation and provides reasoning for why some level of punishment may be fair.

Reply B, on the other hand, focuses more on the broader issues of police misconduct and the implications of officers expressing themselves while on duty. While they make valid points about the potential implications of even mildly suggestive acts by officers, their argument is more focused on the overall behavior of police departments rather than the specific incident at hand. This may not directly address the original poster's belief that the officer should not face punishment for dancing at the parade. 

Overall, Reply A provides a more direct and relevant argument for why the officer's conduct could be considered unprofessional, which may be more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"I know Sanders is probably the best candidate for BLM policies (though O'Malley is good as well), and that his supporters are probably the most likely to support BLM. This is exactly why I think he's the right choice.

First, I think it means you get less backlash against the movement in general. If she were to interrupt another candidate, more people would use that as evidence against the BlackLivesMatter movement in general. That means more people would use the incident to negatively paint the entire BLM movement since they are less familiar with it, while the Sanders supporters who would be upset would be the least likely to do this.

Second, it forces Bernie to make a bigger deal out of racial injustice in his campaign. Even if he doesn't support the people who interrupt him, he has to at least issue some statement that says ""Why'd you pick on me? Here's everything I'm doing to help . . ."" and suddenly, it's a major part of his campaign.

Sanders *does* have a solid [page on racial injustice](https://berniesanders.com/issues/racial-justice) on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to [O'Malley's page](https://martinomalley.com/policy/criminal-justice/), Sanders has a lot of work to do. Interestingly enough, O'Malley began to better flush out his policy on criminal just after he was interrupted by BLM protesters.

Forcing his hand in making his stances on racial justice more public and more thorough is the best way to make it a bigger campaign issue, and is the best possible result for the BLM movement at large.

These things could be beloved things like first night in Boston for example, sit-ins, blocking off ramps. I can get behind shutting that down to raise awareness (I can't recall for certain if that was directly tied to #BlackLivesMatter, but it was certainly tied to the momentum begun under the Ferguson protests.) By interrupting the speech they were acting in that vein. By demanding four and a half minutes of silence they were acting in that vein. Even by making the statements about Seattle is a racist city they were acting in that vein (In response to the ""Let Bernie Speak"" chants). Where I think they made a miscalculation was in refusing to give back the mic. I suspect they refused to do that because people in the rally were no respecting the moment of silence (which was pretty tactless on the people crying ""Let Bernie Speak"").  

If the objective was about exposing the hypocrisy of white progressive liberals, how does forcing him to leave, then give a scripted response, and making Sanders out to be another unappreciated advocate accomplish that objective? Sanders respected their actions by standing to the side, letting them speak and not speaking during the moment of silence. I don't mention that to make Sanders out to be some saint, only to outline a rationale for what could have happened had they given back the mic. I don't think its unreasonable he would have told the crowd that they shouldn't have spoken during the moment of silence, then speak on the topics, if only briefly, that #BlackLivesMatter want to have, and then resumed to the itinerary of the rally. But even a brief detour like that would have been a massive statement: #BlackLivesMatter has a primacy in this political cycle over other political issues, they can dictate the conversation if they so choose, and force others to recognize the issues at hand, which *is the entire point of the hashtag*. Instead, they created another martyr of under-appreciated advocacy. It was a miscalculation. 

Moreover, the fallout is reminiscent of the fall of the Puerta del Sol and OWS protests. Both fizzled out because they became about purity, infighting and diversifying of objectives unrelated to the root cause of the protest. #BlackLivesMatter advocates are already concerned about other groups trying to hijack the hashtag for their subgoals. I was at the end of the Puerta del Sol protests, and believe me, it can get all over the place politically very quickly and that is a fast way for a movement to die out. I am not saying that there isn't a hypocrisy and blind spot in the mentality and thought of white progressive liberals, but not acknowledging how purity and infighting brought down other recent social media driven protests, advocates like these two are making a big mistake.","I think this would be a reasonable response after Bernie was first interrupted by BLM. In response to that he gave a massive speech with SCLC about racial inequality, hired outspoken BLM supporter Symone Sanders to be his national press secretary, and truly made combating racial injustice a cornerstone of his campaign. 

Did you not hear or read the SCLC speech? I'm sure Marissa and Mara didn't. Here's a link to it https://berniesanders.com/remarks-senator-sanders-southern-christian-leadership-conference/

Important to note that speech was given before O'Malley posted his policy positions on racial issues. Bernie actually reacted faster. 

The interruption on Saturday did absolutely nothing to make Sanders more focused on racial issues. He had already hired Symone, she had already written her speech to introduce him Saturday night and speak out about how we need to end institutionalized racism in the country. The page on racial issues had already been written. 

Essentially, BLM asked Bernie to change in July, and by all appearances he has embraced the BLM message and changed in all the ways they asked of him. The ""protest"" yesterday did absolutely nothing to help their cause because they've already won Bernie over and he's already clearly the biggest supporter of the movement of all current candidates. All they accomplished was making themselves look bad. When you ask someone to change and they do it, you don't slap them and yell in their face about some of the changes being marginally slower than you would've liked.",A,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides specific examples of Bernie Sanders' actions and responses to the BLM movement, such as his speech with the SCLC and hiring Symone Sanders. These actions demonstrate Sanders' commitment to addressing racial injustice and show that he has already made strides in supporting the BLM movement. Additionally, Reply B points out that Sanders had already taken steps to address racial issues before O'Malley posted his policy positions, indicating that Sanders was proactive in his response.

On the other hand, Reply A focuses more on the tactics and potential consequences of the BLM interruption, but does not provide as much concrete evidence of Sanders' actions in support of the movement. Reply B effectively counters the argument made in the original post by highlighting Sanders' efforts and commitment to racial justice, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."

predict-explain,"*[This article](https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/12/health-risk-having-gun-home) does a pretty good job of pulling the relevant statistics together that I find convincing. In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/defensive-gun-ownership-gary-kleck-response-115082.html#.Vdm1n_lVhBc) that lays out some criticisms of the first article's source study, along with a rebuttal from another journalist who's written on the topic.*

I believe that:

1. You, or someone in your family, are more likely to be killed by your gun either purposefully or accidentally than you are to use the gun against an attacker successfully in self-defense.

2. Therefore, if your goal is to make yourself and/or your family safer, then choosing to keep a gun in your home explicitly for that purpose is an irrational decision.


I do believe there is one exception to this. If you have a particular reason or belief that you are likely to be attacked, then, since the odds of being attacked have increased dramatically, then it may be rational to have a gun in the house for self-defense. For example, if you have a stalker. If you have received threats on your life. If you have any reasonable belief that someone will try to harm you specifically. If government or police forces have broken down. Basically, if the odds change so that for you the risk of you or your family being attacked is greater than the risk of having a gun in the house, then it would be rational to have a gun.

But we do know, statistically, on average, that is not the case. So for the average person, the risks are such that the rational decision for maximizing safety is to not keep a gun.

I further believe that if you get other uses out of the gun other than just self-defense, then the other added benefits of having a gun would make it rational to keep one in the house. For example, if somebody was a hunter and or target shooter and they get a lot of joy out of their hobby, that could be worth the risk of gun ownership. Or even if someone cited tradition, or the need of an armed populace as a check on the government, that too could be a perceived benefit to them that makes the safety risk worthwhile. I'm strictly speaking about what's the best decision for maximizing personal and family safety.

Change my view by showing me that the risk of harm to you or your family is lower by having a fire arm in the house.

If you've ever lived in the country, you know how valuable a gun can be. It is not uncommon for people to wander up your driveway and check to see if anyone is inside the house. More than once, I've been saved from robbery (or worse) by brandishing a rifle. But the best part is I've never had to shoot anyone. I've never even had to shoot *at* anyone. For most purposes, just the sight of a gun is enough.

So I'd argue that it is very rational to keep a gun in your house for self-defense purposes. However, it could be considered irrational (considering the statistics you mentioned) to keep ammunition.","The [chance of a random American being killed](http://blog.nj.com/njv_paul_mulshine/2009/09/madds_bad_with_the_facts.html) by a drunk driver is about one in 100k in any give year.

But the chance of *ME* being killed by a drunk driver is vastly smaller.  I'm almost never driving after 10pm, don't drive much on rural roads, and most of my driving is on low-speed surface streets.

Statistics are great  for getting overall trends, but suck at predicting individual outcomes.

If I lived alone (i.e., no spouse or family), were well-trained in handling firearms safely, with no history of depression, the odds would be dramatically different than the ones you list.  

In that case, it would be perfectly rational for me to have a gun, since I'm not likely to use it to commit suicide, my non-existent kid isn't going to find it and accidentally kill his friend, and I'm not going to wake up without knowing my non-existent wife slipped out to satisfy a Ben and Jerry's craving and shoot her because I think she's a burglar.

There just aren't a whole lot of circumstances that make it likely that my gun would be used in error.

You point may hold that it's irrational *for the average person* to own a gun.  But for many real people it's completely rational.",B,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a compelling argument by pointing out that statistics are great for overall trends but can't predict individual outcomes. By considering the specific circumstances and characteristics of the individual, such as living alone, being well-trained in handling firearms, and having no history of depression, Reply B shows that the risk factors mentioned in the original post may not apply to everyone. This personalized approach effectively challenges the blanket statement made in the original post and highlights that for certain individuals, owning a gun can be a rational decision. Additionally, Reply B acknowledges the potential risks associated with gun ownership but presents a nuanced perspective on how these risks can be mitigated based on individual circumstances."
predict-explain,"A little background, I have over 600 hours in tf2, mostly playing as pyro, soldier or medic. I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was entirely removed.

A good sniper has no real counter apart from another sniper, making them frustrating to play against. A majority of the other weapons have damage fall-off to discourage long-range play, further separating the sniper as a class. 

As far as I can tell, snipers mainly exist to pick off slow moving or high value targets, which the spy already does and does in a more interesting (to play as and against) way.

I can't see any way the sniper, sitting at the back of the map away from the action, adds to the game (as a side note, I also think the removal of sniper would do nothing but good for the class diversity on pubs).

Your opinion is not an uncommon one, and I believe the developers have even stated that the sniper added the least to the game out of all the classes, but I think you need to articulate your reasoning better before I or anyone else can attempt to change your view. 

The only point (from a gameplay perspective) I see you've provided is that the sniper is a long range pick class; and there already exists a far more dynamic pick class, the spy. However, the spy is an inconsistent, and thus ineffective, pick class. The range, preparation, patience, luck required to get a backstab on an attentive target (especially when players are actively searching and attempting to stop the spy from reaching a medic or heavy), combined with the fact that you are unlikely to survive after the pick in question is completed, again provided the team is competent enough to have a pyro near the combo to flush you out, makes the spy class hard to play and have little impact on the game. 

If you've ever watched competitive Highlander, you'll notice the spy does very little for most of the game; usually their role is literally that of a spy, to sit with a Cloak and Dagger and report on the enemy's movements. In 6s, spy is the least used class besides engineer. It's because as a pick class, the spy is ineffective most of the time. If you're pub stomping or whatever, then you'll obviously dominate the other team, but a halfway organized team can shut down a decent spy. 

It's necessary to have a class that can provide picks based on purely skill and not luck or the competency of your enemies. There needs to be a pick class that cannot be safeguarded against with little effort, at the cost of less role diversity. That is why the sniper is a very important class to have.","&gt; I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was entirely removed.

Well, an entire group of people would lose their main and would most likely stop playing. Also, all the cosmetics and weapons for sniper would become worthless, which will impact the economy and fuck a lot of people over. 

Now, I'm not a competitive TF2 player, but I can tell you that sniper adds a lot. Without sniper, people don't have to be nearly as careful with their movement. Also, Sniper has the ability to turn the game around by making important picks like demo or medic. Without him, the losing team has a small chance of recovering if they lose an important class. 

As for pubs,  sniper fullfills the same role as he does in competitve, which makes him valuable. 

&gt; A good sniper has no real counter apart from another sniper, making them frustrating to play against

A good sniper can be countered by good spies, good soldiers (depends on the map) and a good scout (depends on the map). Also, if the team is careful and has good movement, average snipers will have a hard time picking them off. 

They're only frustrating to play against if your team sucks, which is true for the rest of the classes as well. 

&gt; As far as I can tell, snipers mainly exist to pick off slow moving or high value targets, which the spy already does and does in a more interesting (to play as and against) way.

He also denies the enemy certain paths, something the spy can't do. He also has different counters. 

&gt;  I also think the removal of sniper would do nothing but good for the class diversity on pubs

You can make the same case for scouts, spies and engineers when playing on defense. 

Sniper is an annoying class. As someone who spends most of his time playing Heavy (inb4 n00b), Medic and other Combo classses, I hate sniper and Spy. However, they have their place in the game even though I don't like them.",A,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a more in-depth analysis of why the sniper class is important in TF2. It discusses the role of the spy as a pick class and explains why the sniper is necessary for providing picks based on skill rather than luck or the competency of the enemy team. The argument is well-articulated and backed up with examples from competitive gameplay.

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the potential negative consequences of removing the sniper class, such as impacting the player base and the in-game economy. While these points are valid, they do not directly address the original poster's concerns about the sniper class being frustrating to play against and potentially adding little to the game.

Overall, reply A provides a more thorough and convincing argument for the importance of the sniper class in TF2, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified:

* The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for, either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild. If we're using the usual justification of animal rights - they can feel pain/have a life - then letting them lead a safe and happy life in captivity seems to be more moral than the dangers of the wild.

* This is a less quantifiable good, but zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies.

While I guess the best way to C my V would be to provide overwhelming evidence that zoos provide lower quality of life for the animals than life in the wild and that there are more effective means of conserving/promoting endanger species, I'm mostly interested in values/premises I haven't considered.

""In general, I wasn't interested in seeing animals in cages. The animals know that you are watching them; they feel those hundreds of curious eyes and are affected by them. No, let us have animals that don't know you are watching them, those shy creatures puttering about in their winter lairs, lying there with somnolent eyes, licking their paws and thinking. Eh?""

The fact is, animals were not meant to be in cages. It doesn't matter that captivity is ""safer""; the only animals that really have an understanding of what that word means are the apex predators anyway. So you have the lions and tigers and bears doing nothing but eating and sleeping. And you have the lesser animals doing the same, only they're constantly terrified because they're *out in the open.* And they're all, all of them being watched. Constantly. The hunter, used to being stealthy and unseen, is now always surrounded by noise and bustle. The hunted, used to short lives of uncertainty and frantic reproduction, grow decrepit without being able to fulfill their biological imperatives. In both cases are they hounded with unwanted attention. 

Conservation is an important issue, and will continue to be even more so as the human population grows. More species--beautiful creatures--will inevitably go extinct. However, I don't think the answer to that problem is to round up the survivors and stick them in cages.

As a final point: a zoo could be the epitome of ethical and you'd still have the douchebags/children that come in and tap the glass, throw concessions into the cages, yell, and generally disturb the animals in the hope of getting a reaction.","I actually agree with you, and could add many more reasons why zoos can be ethical, but that's not the point here so :

  - endangered animals can be cared for : It's true but it's only a very small portions of endangered animals that the public find cute or know about that will be protected this way. The reasons why some animals are protected in the wild or in a zoo are wildly irrational.

  - Most of these animals are 'exotic' and you concern has very little chance of changing things in these animals former countries. Also there are many other ways to attract attention to these animals than enslave them and put them in a cage. We actually did that at the World Expo in Brussels with Congolese tribesmen. And I can conclusively confirm that it wasn't really conductive to intercultural understanding and enlightenment. It was another freak show, and the exploitation of living beings for financial purposes.

So yes, zoo can be ethical but it has never been their vocation. They are not actual non-profit organizations.",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a strong argument against the ethical justification of zoos by highlighting the negative impact of captivity on animals. The user effectively argues that animals are not meant to be in cages and that even if conservation is important, putting animals in zoos is not the solution. The user also brings up the issue of unwanted attention and disturbance from visitors, further emphasizing the negative aspects of zoos.

Reply B, on the other hand, acknowledges that zoos can be ethical but focuses more on the limitations and shortcomings of zoos rather than providing a strong argument against them. The user mentions that there are other ways to attract attention to endangered animals without putting them in captivity, but does not delve deeply into the ethical concerns of keeping animals in zoos.

Overall, Reply A presents a more compelling argument against the ethical justification of zoos and is more likely to challenge the original poster's views."
predict-explain,"In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want to is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to things that are unacceptable to do to a person without his or her permission. Telling someone that they can't get a medical procedure done (or, likewise, telling that they HAVE to get a medical procedure done) is just as awful as is dictating how they were their hair or how they dress. In that same vein, what makes it okay in our society for your significant other to dictate who you sleep with? 

Sex in our society is a recreational activity enjoyed by most adults in at least some capacity. People dictating what their SOs do for fun in their free time seems rather controlling. Adults should feel free to do what their bodies what they wish as long as they aren't physically forcing another person to do something. Forcing another person to only have sex with you seems to me like an awfully controlling behavior and takes away the body autonomy that they should have. 

I can understand if a couple decides between the two of them that would like to sleep exclusively with each other. It's just surprising to me at times that it is the norm to be mad enough at your SO to break up with them if they have sex with someone outside of the relationship. I understand that people cheat all the time, but open relationships just seem to be the exception rather than the norm. 

If you want a monogamous relationship and your SO sleeps with someone else, then you shouldn't be mad at your SO. You should simply realize that you guys want different things out of a relationship and part ways. Getting angry would be controlling your SO and taking away his or her own control over his or her own body. 

And just for clarification: I am not saying that everyone should go out and cheat on their SOs. I am more stating that it *should* be normal and acceptable for people to have sex with people outside of a two person relationship for no other reason than that it is oddly controlling to insist that your SO sleep with no one besides you. 

Also, I wanted to point out that I am purposefully not using particular genders. It is just as bad to for a woman to tell a man he can't have sex outside the relationship as it would be if a man told a woman the same thing. 

So, please. Change my view! Why should it be the norm to have monogamous relationships?

It seems like what your advocating is that people be cool with non-monogamous relationships. But you are ignoring the fact that the majority of people tend to associate sex with an emotional monogamous bond. You don't? Cool, find someone else who feels the same way.

predict-explain,"While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes to win the Democratic nomination for a myriad of reasons:

(1) Huge swaths of Democratic blocs have little-to-no idea who he is. Working class Democrats, Blacks, Hispanics are all in the same boat. The only people who have a vested interest in him are college students and certain areas of the internet. No one seems to be addressing this huge discrepancy either, making the whole thing reek of another ""Ron-volution"".

(2) Our economic problems aren't behind us by any stretch of the imagination, but we are slowly recovering and the media seems to be shifting its focus toward international affairs such as ISIL and Russia. Hilary has the advantage here as a former Secretary of State. If something happens between now and the election, it would only further her lead.

(3) This one is a bit shaky, kinda sexist, and based on personal antidotes, but here it is. Mrs. Clinton is a woman. I remember in my class a few months back a straw pole my professor conducted an informal poll of who was going to voting for who and why. Almost unanimously (professor included) were in favor of voting for Hilary on the sole qualification that she was a woman and that would be good simply because it would signal to other women that they could have a career in politics. I don't necessarily agree with this mentality, but you can't argue that a lot of people will vote for her for that reason simply because of that ""progressive"" position.

(4) Even if Hilary gaffes and scandals her way out of the nomination and hands it to Bernie on a silver platter, Republicans are going to have a field day turning this into a shit show. Mud will be slung at the Radical Vermont Socialist who'll just continue Obama's policies. Corporate interests will pile the money on. The Baby Boomers will come out in full force and vote for whoever the GOP will push out simply out of fear. A good chunk of Americans don't believe in global climate change, how in the hell are they going to vote for a socialist?

I will admit that my opinion is incredibly jaded. I will also admit once more that I really want to see Bernie win, but I just can't imagine a universe where that happens.

Edit: There has been a lot of great debate over the last 12 hours about this issue. Ultimately, I can't count this as fully persuaded/""Bernie is going to win the nomination and take the White House."" However, the never has changed to an itty bitty maybe baby. It is smaller than a gnat's stomach, but its there. Regardless, keep debating you magnificent bastards!","&gt;  Huge swaths of Democratic blocs have little-to-no idea who he is.

This can be changed and it is changing currently. In national polls, his approval has grown 5 times since May. And the number of people who haven't heard of him has been cut in half.

&gt; No one seems to be addressing this huge discrepancy either

That's simply not true. Check any news site, tv show, or even /r/SandersForPresident

&gt; Our economic problems aren't behind us by any stretch of the imagination, but we are slowly recovering

The problems that Bernie focuses on are not getting better. He does not talk about GDP growth, the Dow Jones, and nominal unemployment.

Wage growth has been stagnant since the 1970's. Income inequality continues to increase. Obamacare only helped ~7 million out of 47 million uninsured. Climate change is rocketing off towards disaster. College costs continue to shoot up. 

For Bernie's issues, we have not seen a recovery. And even in the areas where we are ""recovering,"" the working class does not see it. Almost all new ""recovery"" income is going to the top 1%, and 5% unemployment is inflated by low participation and part-time work.

&gt; the media seems to be shifting its focus toward international affairs such as ISIL and Russia.

Fuck the media. You *know* CNN and FOX are just blowing up those stories because they scare people and boost ratings. [Voters continue to care far and away about the economy more than anything else](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx). The number of people who care first about terrorism and national security *combined* is 10%, while economic concerns are 33%.

&gt; Hilary has the advantage here as a former Secretary of State. If something happens between now and the election, it would only further her lead.

I don't know. That Iraq vote killed her last time, and now she's actually running against someone who voted against the war.

&gt; but you can't argue that a lot of people will vote for her for that reason simply because of that ""progressive"" position

This is nonsense. Democrats who identify as progressives *already* approve more of Bernie than Hillary, and that lead is only increasing.

EDIT: spelling","While I mostly agree with you, I think you're downplaying two issues.

In the primaries, it's really just Sanders &amp; Clinton.  The middle class has been shrinking but it just vanished after '08.  The American people don't just want a better economy.  Most want restitution.  Most want to have opportunities afforded that were gutted from the middle class.  ~~Clinton makes not claim to that.~~ **EDIT** Thanks to /u/Yosarian2  [for pointing out that I'm wrong on this.](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-clinton-economy-20150711-story.html)    

Warren had a lot of momentum on leveling the playing field and when she didn't run it transferred to Sanders because he began to run similar campaigns and used similar rhetoric.  He's offering what the people want most right now and she - while probably more capable of delivering - ~~just isn't saying the same things.~~  See edit above.

Before discussing the Presidential debate I want to remind you of the clown car, shit-show that was the 2012 Republican Primaries.  The Republicans had **14** candidates.  It took 5 debates just to get through it.  This was the first Presidential election since the super pacs and the amount of negative ads that aired was unprecedented.  The end result was that the Republicans themselves filtered out the most challenging candidates (namely Jon Huntsman).  In the end, the only people who stuck around were those who had more to gain by the slim prospect than they had to lose by continuing to allow their oppontents to tarnish their reputation.

By the time the Presidential debate rolled around, not only were the more challenging candidates gone, but all of the ammunition to beat the Republicans was given to the Democrats by other Republicans through the negative ad campaigns.  In 2016, there are already **28** candidates for the Republican primaries.

predict-explain,"Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich. However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons:

First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”. Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people’s inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. 

Second of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds. Examples for this are Venezuela or Columbia. 

All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc. However this are minor elements, which I think, should otherwise be implemented in fierce Capitalist society, where in order to succeed you cannot rely on gov. support, but 95 % on yourself.

Edit: I hope this is not too long of an explanation.

This why the  phrase ""Workers of the World, Unite!"" exists.

Ultimately, the biggest thing that can be done is to unite the working class. Join unions, negotiate better pay and working conditions for everyone the world over.

Obviously this is better achieved at a country level - but it can be expanded worldwide by those who are doing something in their own country, to (for example) only purchase or conduct businesses with other companies in other countries who are also improving the rights of their workers. Ultimately, everyone should be paid well for reasonable hours *regardless* of their job. And by ""well"" I mean a lot more than lowest earners are currently getting, by ""well"" I mean a wage that allows people to *live* and not work for little return.

This is achievable, and will have a real impact on the entirety of humanity. It will change the economy from that of an exploitative one, to one that promotes good pay for all, and allow us to live our lives, follow our dreams, and work in careers we wish to, instead of being wage slave until we die.

Right now there is a strike on the underground system in London. Instead of people supporting them in improving their work life, and using this as inspiration to improve *their* own work conditions and pay, people are attacking them. Calling them overpaid, greedy etc (when really the people who are doing the attacking and name calling are weak and powerless as they are too afraid to do the same thing - if someone has what you don't have, you should aim to get the same, not take away from what they have. This only makes things worse for everyone, including themselves,  as then being a low paying wage slave is the norm).

EDIT: I rushed writing this so if it doesn't make sense, just ask for clarification :)","The ""argument from human nature"" gets brought up a lot but is surprisingly easy to refute. From all the socialist books I've read, (and I don't know if you've read any), it is never required theoretically that people should become perfect. Instead, socialism as a theory is conceptualised as one which will more perfectly fit human nature as it is. 

Firstly, what is human nature? The first thing we can say about it is that it is very varied. It is just whatever humans do. But humans do a lot of things. 

The central mistake that proponents of the argument from human nature make is a kind of ""begging the question"". They assume that human behaviour in a capitalist system must be the paradigm of human behaviour per se. I think this is demonstrably false, as a moment's reflection will show. 

For the vast majority of time that humans have existed, they were hunter-gatherers, living in fairly small communities or tribes and practising some form or other of primitive communism, ie, sharing the spoils of the hunt. Social structures were also more or less egalitarian, necessarily, because of required co-operation in the hunt. 

If mankind has a species character, it will be informed by being a hunter-gatherer, living in a social group. Other social forms, cities, states, capitalism, consumerism, and so on, are much later, much more recent developments. 

So what we can take from this about human nature? 1. Humans are a social species, they can collaborate and join their labour together for the common good. 2, Humans are creative, and find meaning and dignity in creativity. And you can also, more tentatively, add: 3. Humans are at their best when free to contract the kinds of social relationships and pursue the creative activities they want.

Well this exactly accords with the species character of man described by Marx and, before him, by the philosophers of the Enlightenment. Man is given naturally to free, cooperative, creative labour. 

Now comes the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution transformed the farm worker into a factory worker, a proletariat. Labour became *necessarily* collaborative again. 

Socialism is nothing more, at a basic level, than a theoretical response to these facts about human nature and human creativity, and the facts of limited global resources and labour. If you want to, you can look at it merely as a rational, efficient use of resources and labour, getting rid of unproductive classes, middlemen, profiteers, production of useless commodities, and so on. 

So to sum up, your ""argument from human nature"" is, as usual when this argument is brought up, based on the usual question-begging and is, I'm sorry to say, based on something of a strawman socialism. I recommend that you read up on the topic and you'll see that no serious socialist writer demands or expects perfectibility. 

Your other objection, that socialism, in order to function properly, would require a world-wide system, is more serious and has more force to it.  But that was only ever a long-term goal and it doesn't follow that we can't try to achieve change in our day-to-day lives, and in our own local polities. After all, world-wide changes have been affected before and they will be again. 

I would also briefly say that very few people advocate a Soviet-style system these days. No-one is anxious to recreate the days of Stalin and gulags and show trials. But once you grasp that that was a deviation from the course of socialism proper, (and was recognised as such at the time by perceptive critics), the goals of socialism in the present day become all the more clear.",B,A,"I would say reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a thorough explanation of human nature and how it aligns with socialist principles, addressing the common argument against socialism based on human nature. It also acknowledges the flaws of past socialist experiments, such as the Soviet Union, but distinguishes them from the true goals of socialism. Additionally, reply B addresses the concern about the need for a worldwide socialist system and emphasizes the potential for change at a local level. Overall, reply B presents a well-reasoned argument and provides a more nuanced perspective on socialism, which may be more convincing to the original poster."
predict-explain,"I'm going to clarify that by 'Trigger Warnings', I'm referring to a tag/disclaimer of some sort that warns the audience of content that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response (eg discussions of suicide, rape, murder, etc.). The (exaggerated) culture surrounding TWs of the blanket avoidance of those topics and the overzealous labeling of 'offensive' content is not only something I do not support, but also not the topic of this CMV.

**EDIT: Maybe Trigger Warning wasn't the best phrase to use. I'm simply referring to the adding a disclaimer for content which depicts/describes material in such detail as to recall traumatic memories.**

TWs and Spoiler Alerts serve the same purpose of alerting the audience to content that they may not be willing to expose themselves at the time - be it a graphic depiction of a corpse or who died in the most recent episode of Game of Thrones (which could very well be the same image). While many support the latter, the former is reviled in some circles.

I think the argument for supporting the latter applies to the former: Just as you would like to avoid/be alerted to spoilers until you've gotten to that point in the story (you're 'narratively' prepared), it makes sense to alert others of content which may be emotionally distressing so that they can engage with it when they're emotionally prepared.

You could say that there's a presumption of eventual engagement with Spoiler Alerts, you wouldn't be worried about them if didn't plan on following the story. With TWs, someone could duck out of all triggering content forever. But that doesn't seem to be reason to denounce TWs as a whole: you're still saving that person and many others (who could be working to overcome those triggers) undue emotional distress.

You also could argue with my definition of emotionally distressing content, stating that it very easily leads to a slippery slope ending with everyone having to tag all of their content, but I'm not terribly persuaded by that argument. For one, regardless of a individual communities definitions of spoilers (we all know Snape killed Dumbledore by now, right?), endings and most recent episodes are universally considered spoilers. Similarly, I'm sure that sexual violence and gore can be considered universal triggers. Discovering how broad a community's definition of spoilers/triggers is done by engaging with that community. As for giving TWs being too much of an inconvenience, I think that's more of a matter of getting used to it: you extend that courtesy when discussing spoilers, why not for when you're discussing triggers?

I disagree with this. The goal of a spoiler alert is typically to allow a fan to prevent herself from being exposed to the content *for the purpose of seeing later and being more affected by it*. The goal of trigger warnings, or what people worry is the goal of trigger warnings, is to avoid being exposed to the content *at all*. 

People don't think trigger warnings are ridiculous because they think others will see the warning, take a few minutes or even days to mentally prepare themselves, then read the article. People are worried that others will decide they categorically don't want to be exposed to a certain kind of content and will then shroud themselves in ignorance about it. This is troubling in specific cases where having good information about these kinds of things is important (suppose someone decided discussion of the vaccine-autism link was triggering to them), and in general if we wish our society to adhere to a high epistemic standard. (Or even the educated people in our society; people are demanding college lectures be trigger-warned.)","&gt;  that could reasonably produce an involuntary negative response

This is all conversation.  Me simply disagreeing with you both *is* and *produces* a negative response.  I think that the biggest problem people have with trigger warnings is twofold; the air of sanctimony people have when demanding them compounded with people overusing it and therefore draining it of its meaning.

It's like the [NSFL] tag.  That tag does exactly the same thing as a trigger warning without all the social justice baggage.

The problem with comparing it to spoiler alerts is that we mostly agree that to a good extent, [it's on *you* to avoid the spoilers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8IAhI-B6UU)

There's no give and take with trigger warnings, no compromise.  And it's tone policing which always puts people on guard.",B,A,"I would say that reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a clear and logical argument about the difference in purpose between spoiler alerts and trigger warnings, highlighting the concern that trigger warnings may lead to avoidance of important information rather than just mental preparation.

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on personal opinions and experiences with trigger warnings, such as the perception of sanctimony and overuse. While these points may resonate with some individuals, they do not provide a strong counterargument to the original poster's view. Additionally, the comparison to the NSFL tag and the lack of compromise with trigger warnings may not be as compelling in changing the original poster's perspective. 

Overall, reply A presents a more convincing argument that is likely to challenge the original poster's beliefs and potentially lead to a change in their view."
predict-explain,"So I'll start off by saying that in no way am I promoting the ""gluten free diet"" or any other so called ""fad"" diets such as paleo, keto etc...
Essentially my viewpoint is that making fun of, or telling an individual who chooses to follow these diets that they are naïve and trying to convince them not to follow them is just as bad as making fun of, or saying the same things to a religious individual, such as a Muslim or Jew who cannot eat pork or must eat halal, or kosher food.
In both instances there is no general scientific consensus that agrees with the choices the individuals make; however, in both cases the individuals feel good about their choices whether it be because they feel like they are following the will of their God, or because they believe they are eating healthier. I do make an exception for diets which are unsustainable and will eventually cause either malnutrition or an eating disorder etc… but some diets, such as gluten free or dairy free, do not cause this issue, and the individuals feel great when they do it, whether or not it is a placebo or a result of other factors is irrelevant. I see a lot of hate on people who follow these diets on the internet and in person and I don’t really understand why. If the individuals is an adult and chooses to practice this lifestyle we should respect it as much as we respect individuals who practice their religions. In both cases I agree that if they shove it in people’s faces and try to convert people they know, it is annoying, but if they keep to themselves and understand that it is not for everyone, I don't see a reason for all the hate on people who follow these lifestyles.

predict-explain,"I am a cynical man.  I don't believe in heroes, and so I'm prepared to change my view on this.  THe trouble is, every last bit of news I hear about the current Middle East conflicts goes only to reinforce my ever-growing belief that the Kurds are the only group involved with any moral high ground.

1) The Kurds espouse a number of western values that are largely absent in the region.

Only The Kurds and the (middle and lower class) Iranians show any tendency to respect women's rights or treat them as equals deserving of respect or status.  The Kurds have women in their military, and even their conservative tribal organizations can have Matriarchs in charge of political and military decisions.

2) They care about more than just themselves.

The Kurds have gone out of their way, at significant danger to themselves, to rescue other ethnic minorities in the region, including famously the Yazidis, who everyone else was more than happy to let ISIS literally murder, enslave, and rape at genocidal scales.

3) Their political opponents have all shown themselves to be monsters in the fullness of time.

Turkey is key here.  For a while Turkey managed to keep up quite a reputation as a modern secular-Islamic state.  Now they're wringing their hands about how *powerless* they are to stop ISIS while they gleefully watch the black banner do all their dirty work for them, then step in with overwhelming force to rescue Ataturk's grave the moment it's threatened.  They're bombing Kurdish targets *right now* while crying about ISIS.  I would want independence from them too.

**Things that will not convince me:**

1) A Kurd did something bad once.

Every group consists of a bulk center and extremes on either end.  It takes a pattern of ideological violence to establish that a group is responsible collectively.  I need to be shown that the Kurds, as a national or cultural entity, are at least half as bad as their neighbors in terms of the actions they will routinely, officially, or systemically commit or tolerate.

2) It is advantageous to ally ourselves with monsters.

Look, you can be totally right about this.  I won't even argue that this isn't possible, and might even agree with you, but it does not change my view about what we, the west, *should* be doing.


Make me a cynic again, please.

First of all, there are a number of other actors which does subscribe to woman's rights. Turkey for example has opposition leftist parties which supports women's rights. Israel is also another example of a western valued country in the region.

&gt;2) They care about more than just themselves.


I feel that this part is based on an incredibly....optimistic view of the Kurds.

Kurdish middlemen, including Kurdish political leaders are quite willing to work with ISIS when there's material gains involved. See their involvement with helping ISIS to sell oil for instance:

http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6c269c4e-5ace-11e4-b449-00144feab7de.html#axzz3hJfQSOhy

Every single political group in the Middle-East are largely motivated by material gains. Even incredibly ideological groups have bottom lines. The Kurds are fighting ISIS because they are a threat to Kurdistan, if ISIS wasn't a threat to the Kurds, the Kurds wouldn't fight them even if they are committing genocide.

&gt;3) Their political opponents have all shown themselves to be monsters in the fullness of time.

Turkey isn't even too different from the US in the 1980s in this regard, who cooperated with Islamic extremists to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. 

People are primarily motivated by realistic geopolitics in the region. It's awfully problematic to attribute actions to ""morals"" or ideology when there are so many strange bedfellows if you look at ideology. 

Syria for instance is allied with Iran despite Syria being a nominally secular, atheistic state and Iran is a theocracy. 

Saudi Arabia, the most Islamist country in the region and Egypt are also close despite the fact that the current dictator (let's just admit it) of Egypt came to power on the promise that he will save the country from the Islamists. 

Israel, a western, Jewish state and Saudi Arabia, a country which don't allow Jews into the country, have a defacto alliance against Iran. And Israel sees the Saudis as a stabilizer in the Gulf.

Overall, I think you underestimate how self-interested people are, if the day comes when the Kurds needs to cooperate with ISIS (say against the Iraqi central government), they will do it to guarantee their own survival.","""The Kurds"" are an ethnic group, with a similar mix of people as any other. There are many Kurds in ISIS. When you're describing ""The Kurds,"" you're conflating many different groups with different agendas and ideologies, to the point that they have openly fought each other in the past. For example, you cite women's rights, when Kurdish areas have some of the highest rates of Female Genital Mutilation of anywhere in the world. The YPG in Syria are a socialist/communist movement with a high regard for women's rights, but they are drastically different from the Iraqi Kurds. The same PKK fighters that might save the Yizidis one month are placing fake emergency calls and shooting/kidnapping the police and nurses who respond the next.

I am extremely sympathetic to the cause of the YPG in particular, but I feel like your view is unduly influenced by the way the western media has simplified and thereby misrepresented the situation in the middle east.",B,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"Every month or so, we hear about a tragic story of a hiker attacked by an animal (usually a bear) while they are out in the wild. Often times, the animal is unprovoked. But sometimes an animal's instincts will overtake it, and it will perceive a hiker as a potential threat to either it or its offspring. Whenever an attack on a human happens, park officials from wherever the incident occurred place traps to catch and euthanize the animal.

I don't think that animals that attack hikers should be killed. I love the National Park System, and everything they do, but I just don't think that it is appropriate. The NPS was created for the purpose of being preserved. With that preservation comes the opportunity for us as humans to enjoy them in their uttermost beauty, but that doesn't mean we should start altering them for our convenience. 

Yes, wild bears can be dangerous. They're BEARS for heaven's sake! But their habitat isn't ours to make our own. Part of hiking through these parks, whether it's the Great Smoky Mountains (where the North America's largest density of black bears reside) or Yellowstone National Park (where a grizzly killed a hiker just yesterday), wild animals are going to be wild. 

The national parks are to be preserved, not to be altered for our enjoyment.","It's not a matter of justice or what's right. The fact is that we value the life of a human over the life of an animal. When an animal attacks, even if provoked, there is a significant chance that it will attack again. The risk of someone else being harmed or killed is too great to favour the life of that animal.

If you disagree with this concept, as is your right, you may also want to reconsider where the meat you buy comes from or how the milk you put in your cereal is collected (assuming you are not already a vegan)","I see your point, but animals that attack humans aren't put down for justice or vengeance. An animal that attacks a human is very likely to do it again, so they're killed for the safety of any other humans who they come across.

Look at the AskReddit questions about child abuse, rape, worst experiences, etc., and how many people use throwaway accounts in general because they don't want to be defined by those moments.","If you think about it, the number of people trolling or being fools in comments would increase. This is my logic: if someone, as you mentioned earlier, is mean enough to troll someone about the death of a beloved family member, the same people would be tempted to use your system in order to, for example, impersonate others, or the basic info section would be empty, except for a few kind souls, who would be ridiculed by the anons.",A,A,"I would say reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

This response helps to broaden the original poster's understanding of why anonymity is valued by many internet users, rather than just focusing on the negative aspects of it. Additionally, reply A offers a more nuanced and empathetic view, which may resonate with the original poster and prompt them to reconsider their stance on the issue."
predict-explain,"Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for “sleeping around"", and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. 

I want to make this point clear – I am NOT debating whether or not it is good/bad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of ""slut."" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified.

The reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care of/raising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation.

Given these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. 

Once again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction.

To illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue.

Now, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination.

The difference between Bob and Patrick is this – Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over $5 billion from his father's trust fund.

So, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieve/accomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse.

Now, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biology/sociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios. I could be wrong on this, but it's more of an ancillary point rather than my main argument.

To make sure that you've been reading all the way down to the bottom, I would really appreciate it if you started your post with any word that rhymes with ""crime."" 

Thanks!!!

No

&gt;Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for “sleeping around"", and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour.

It seems like the crux of your argument is that it is harder for men to sleep with women than it is for women to sleep with men, and since it is more difficult, it is more impressive and praiseworthy.

There are three main problems with your argument. First, I do not think your characterization of the ""stud/slut inequality"" is fair. When people complain that society treats men and women differently in this regard, it is not because women receive less praise than men. It is because women are met with scorn and hostility. If female sexuality was viewed as merely ""unimpressive"", I think that would be a substantial improvement. Your argument doesn't justify hostility, and so I don't think you have attempted to justify the main aspect of this inequality that people care about.

Second, your hypothesis has no proof. You could equally guess that women should in fact be more promiscuous than men, because they have an incentive to confuse the paternity of their children, ensuring support from as many men as possible. In fact, I think there is much more evidence here in favour of a social explanation. rather than a biological one. It is harder for people to sleep with women because society will criticize women who sleep with multiple people.

Most importantly, there is no obvious reason why a combination of difficulty and alleged biological incentive make something praiseworthy. There is probably some biological incentive to kill others- less competition for food and mates. It is certainly very difficult to kill someone. Is killing someone praiseworthy? Would we be justified in praising them?","Crime. You are correct in that it's harder for men to sleep with a bunch of women than a woman to sleep with a bunch of men.

The problem is you are attempting to shuffle off the ""Morality"" of women being promiscuous to another discussion, but at the same time you are saying that it's justified to call a woman a slut for doing it.

If you are going to say it's justified, we *have* to have that conversation as a part of this one. If the only reason we called women sluts was because it is easy for them to have lots of sex, then maybe we could ignore it, but you and I both know that isn't the reason.

It can't be justified to insult a woman for the same thing you praise a man for, unless you agree that women *should* be insulted for it. It's just not a separate issue.",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A effectively addresses the main points of the original post, pointing out flaws in the argument and providing counterarguments. The user highlights the unfair treatment of women in society when it comes to sexual behavior, challenges the biological explanation provided by the original poster, and questions the idea that difficulty and alleged biological incentives make something praiseworthy. 

On the other hand, while Reply B also addresses the issue of morality and the treatment of women for their sexual behavior, it does not provide as strong of a counterargument or challenge the original poster's points as effectively as Reply A does. Reply B focuses more on the inconsistency in the original poster's argument without delving as deeply into the underlying issues. 

Overall, Reply A presents a more comprehensive and well-reasoned response, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately.  I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural.  If after death we experience what we experienced before birth which is nothingness, then isnt life meaningless?  Why should we continue to suffer when life is literally a constant suffering?  I personally believe life is meaningless.  When you are under the assumption that you experience nothingness when you are dead, what is the point of living?  
The only reason I can personally see for living is to not inflict additional emotional suffering on those that you know and care about you.  But if you do experience nothingness after life then why should it matter when you wont be able to conceive of this suffering.
Its been something I've been thinking a lot about lately... Change my view, please.
Also, this is not a cry for help and I will not be jumping off the golden gate bridge any time soon.","There's two issues you deal with here: 

1) Life is, objectively, meaningless.
2) We should all independetly choose to kill ourselves.

The problem with both of these notions is that you are dealing with very subjective issues. 

Life is meaningless? Really? To who? You? There's people that find lots of value in their lives that are extremely satisfied with what happiness they can find in their short life times. 

We should all commit suicide? How about - we should all find meaning in our seemingly meaningless lives? 

We have the ability to see the world, do anything we want in life, love each other and grow as human beings together.

Calling this life 'meaningless' is merely a subjective cynical view by you or some other people, and does not apply to the objective view of 'meaning' nor the conclusion that we should all kill ourselves. 

Imagine a beautiful parade outside of your window: People dancing, music, drinking and generally a big celebration. 

There's two different ways to look at this parade: You see the beautiful spectacle for what it is and feel the energy the environment is projecting onto you.

Or

You see the dirty stain on your window and view the parade as background noise. 

Is life really meaningless - or is it meaningless to you? 

And should you kill yourself - or should you try finding the missing meaning? 

And if both answers are yet again negative - does it really apply to everyone in the world? 

Probably not.","The meaning and purpose of life is a subjective matter, and if I feel that my life has meaning and purpose, and if I want to live, why should I kill myself just because *your* life doesn't have meaning  and purpose?

You can argue for your own suicide, but why inflict that same conclusion on everyone else?",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A addresses the original poster's concerns about life being meaningless and the idea of suicide in a more empathetic and understanding manner. It acknowledges the subjective nature of finding meaning in life and encourages the original poster to consider different perspectives and ways of finding meaning. Reply A also uses a relatable analogy with the parade to illustrate the idea that life may not be inherently meaningless, but rather it is the individual's perception that shapes their experience. Overall, Reply A provides a more nuanced and thoughtful response that is likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially change their view."
predict-explain,"On my mobile, so I'll be short, also it would be ironic if I wasn't.

If you can't make your point in a paragraph then you're not going to convince anyone.

1. Attention spans are too short.
2. If you can't distill your point into a few well chosen sentences you probably don't have enough mastery over the subject to convince anyone.

My point of view is more about rhetoric than being rigorously correct. I'm aware that there exists concepts that cannot be expressed in short form. I'm saying that communicating these concepts cannot reliably survive the medium of the Reddit post and still be effective at changing views.

EDIT_1: Thanks to everyone who has responded thus far.  I've had a few minor deltas and at this point now I've made the following modifications to my position.

1. The optimal length doesn't have to be a paragraph.  However, I contend that there is definite diminishing returns and negative returns associated with making points overly long.
2. For ideas complex enough to require long explanations, I still believe that the internet is a much less effective medium for this discussion than other options.  However, I will concede that it is not **ineffective**.  That was an overstatement.

EDIT_2: For clarity, I am intending on awarding deltas to a handful of users, but not until my position is settled.

EDIT_3: I am going AFK for a few hours.  When I return I'll address any points I am able that I've missed and award deltas.","I think it depends on the audience.  I agree you should be able to sum up your point in a sentence or two, but that does not mean your entire argument needs to be short.

For a target audience with a high level of knowledge on the subject, you're going to need multiple sources to validate multiple points of fact to change all but the narrowest of views.

It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific human need to continue to eat meat in much of the western world. This is the same thing; most of the time, we aren't hunting because we need to, we're hunting because we want to. 

What this selective outrage over Cecil tells me is that we, as a society, simply don't have any unified logic towards how we are supposed to treat animals and instead attach our moral views of animal treatment to whatever our culture finds fashionable. Walter James Palmer is potentially going to face criminal charges while Tyson and Perdue make an industry out of their treatment of animals. There is little difference. 

Edit: My opinion on this has been changed. Cecil's existence as a national treasure to Zimbabwe is enough to justify selective outrage. Moreover, Cecil's death specifically highlights issues inherent in illegal poaching.

In 7th and 8th grade I was a snob. This was probably because I am the youngest of five siblings and was fairly better looking than my classmates (before the acne, bad eyesight and crooked teeth kicked in) among other things. 


I realised this because of the way my classmates talked about me and treated me and I took the summer of 8th grade to transform into somebody else. I do not recall how exactly I did it but I did. Everybody was surprised, myself included, that the transformation was permanent and genuine.

Sadly, I was no longer a bitch but a pushover instead. I was bullied shortly after and had a horrible 8 or so years until I graduated from university. During those 8 or so years, my first love died in a car crash, my parents had a terrible accident leaving my mother unable to walk for a year, of course I picked up smoking, I started to serial-date guys and their treatment to me kept getting progressively worse all while I tried to do well at university because it was getting too expensive for my parents to pay for and getting a job wasn't enough for me to sustain myself.

Add to the above a religious struggle between myself, my society and my own mother who didn't talk to me for three months while I lived in the same house as her because of my religious and romantic choices (I was dating a black guy), and you get a fairly broken person.

I didn't trust anyone, I was naive, nervous, insecure, a people pleaser, somewhat promiscuous and a smoker. I did things I never thought I'd do and was put in situations I never wanted to be placed in.


I was even ashamed of my own psychologist whom I never went back to visit after a couple of sessions because of how fucked up I was.

My issues seem trivial but these are just the things that I haven't blocked out. My view does apply to individuals who have gone through everything but EXTREME trauma. 

My POINT is: How can I, and so many people who have gone through worse, emerge as functional if not even better people than we were because of what we went through by using our own logic and reasoning, the help of others, counselling and other resources, while others simply act as if life is supposed to be somehow tailored for them and that whatever 'triggers' them by making them actually have to THINK about what they went through should somehow be erased from their lives?


Tl;dr: Shit happens in life and people should wade through the pile of crap and come out as functional human beings via their own logic rather than project their issues unto others and claim that whatever 'triggers' them to think about their problems must somehow be banished or banned.

Telling someone with a serious PTSD trigger to get over it is like telling someone with depression to cheer up or someone with schizophrenia to un-fuck up their brains: it's a unhelpful and impossible.

Your experience is irrelevant, your trauma may have been unquestionably bad, but you do not speak or represent other people even in similar scenarios to yours.

Triggering someone doesn't force them to think about what they went through to deal with it. Triggers induce panic attacks, when your brain enters those, there's no room for ""logic and reasoning"" only an unavoidable sense of impending doom. When soldiers hear fireworks, they're not mildly disturbed by memories, many get into a fetal position and simply cannot function. Rape survivors when held or hugged too strongly when they don't want to be, feel like the worst experience of their lives is happening again and enter a panic mode.

Many people with triggers don't demand they be banned, but that they are notified of triggering things so they can brace themselves or avoid the trigger. Because nobody wants to have a full meltdown at the movies or during class.

Do people bullshit about triggers? Absolutely, but the plight of people with PTSD should not be ignored.","What about soldiers with PTSD? Do they not have triggers? 

I agree with you that society has gone a little overboard with the idea of something ""triggering"" someone else. And I also agree with you when you say we shouldn't have to tailor everything we do to make others feel comfortable. But that doesn't mean triggers don't exist or that they aren't real.

predict-explain,"This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in.  I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained.  

My wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country.  I will reflect on my mother’s story.  She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country.  When she came to this country she was on government assistance.  With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master’s Degree.  Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community.  I don’t need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent’s generation, their hard work and sacrifice.  

I hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country.  I’ve read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings.  However I don’t completely buy into it.  I’ve seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education.  As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I’ll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do.   At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint.  As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings.  They had no problems acting 'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america.  That is why I don’t have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty.  I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story.  If there are books or articles which provides a cogent counter argument please feel free to share.    

TL:DR – The rationale for why blacks and Hispanics are unsuccessful in the U.S. are bunk because of the success of Asian Immigrants.  

Edit: This is not to say that there isn't racism in society, especially towards Asians.  Colleges definitely try to make it harder for Asians to get admitted despite higher scores, and there is a Bamboo Ceiling in the workplace.  However, I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.  

Edit2: I appreciate the dialogue.  One point which I'll concede and am swayed from the dialogue is that racism, more specifically the historic racism perpetrated in the U.S. such as Jim Crow and Slavery created the culture which is present in the poor black community, hindering them from rising from poverty.  But nothing disputes that this culture is reason, and not the present-day racism that is preventing them from achieving in this country.  That is what I have issue against that the media portrays a image of victimization due to current day racism, however, I don't think the type of racism is the cause, maybe past racism, but not the type minorities face today.  If no one has a counter argument against the cultural aspect, shouldn't black culture, the one that glamorizes the baller lifestyle, be the focused of policy makers to change rather than focusing their efforts on social restructuring to accomodate the culture?  

Edit3: At the end of the day, and the dialogue set forth I come away from it with the following:

1) That current poor black culture  is a result of systemic discrimination.  
2) No one has disputed that culture which I have generally claimed is the REASON for the state of poor black americans.  
3) The present day racism and white privilege that exists today is not sufficient enough to either hold a demographic down or lift them up, not as much as the modern day media seem to claim.   
4) I want to beef up on some books and articles cited
5) The IQ debate. hmmm I'm just not going to touch that right now.","I think the blacks rights thing plays a big issue in this. It really hasn't been that long since that period and the racism from that still persist for a period of time after changes in laws.  In part the effects of that and the slavery thing is still ingrained in their culture. 

For the Latino population, many are illegal immigrants, which really affects their earning potential. Then their families also tend to be bigger too which means more money needed to support. Teen pregnancy rates were also higher for them which hinders them too. 

Asians are lucky with not as strong discrimination and oppression.  I know there is racism, but it's not nearly the same as the other two population. It helps us get ahead as we are seen as ""smarter"" or ""hardworking"".","&gt; I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.

In case of blacks, isn't that sort of begging the question of where that culture *came from*? 

Even if for latinos, you would subscribe for a theory about their countries' catholicism being weaker than protestant work ethic, that would be one thing. 

But how do you argue, that if you kidnap millions of people, keep them as cattle  for generations, forbid them to learn literacy, and break apart their families at will, then for another century, regularly lynch them, force them to live in specific districts, and occasionally firebomb the most successful of those districts, then the resulting ghetto culture somehow won't be primarily and obviously shaped by racism?",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B provides a historical context for the culture that exists in the black community, highlighting the impact of systemic racism and oppression on shaping that culture. By addressing the root causes of the culture, Reply B challenges the original poster's belief that culture is the primary reason for the struggles faced by poor black Americans. Additionally, Reply B's argument is more nuanced and detailed, providing a more thorough and compelling argument compared to Reply A's more general points about discrimination and oppression."
predict-explain,"So I saw someone link to [this column](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/want-to-be-president-show-us-how-youd-handle-a-disaster/2015/07/30/00fa4d8e-315c-11e5-97ae-30a30cca95d7_story.html) and thought it was really clever.

I think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates.  If you want hard questioning, or to know their stand on the issues, interviews from journalists can do that.  Debates are just grandstanding and ""gotchas.""  

A crisis simulation on the other hand would be really useful for getting information about how candidates would do the job of President.  We would see how they asses a situation, how they handle disagreeing advisors, and how deep their knowledge of government runs.

This is also a technique used in a lot of other situations to train and evaluate people who will hold a lot of responsibility.  If you want to be an astronaut, you're going to be doing a lot of simulations.

As far as getting candidates to do it, I could see this being something that a somewhat more obscure candidate does as a way to generate publicity, and which might catch on.   Probably not for the major party candidates for this election cycle, but maybe in the future.

This is because for the most part it's not a question of ""can the candidate perform a task?"" It's a question of ""what will happen if they do?"" Consider the following possible scenarios:

Republican and democratic candidates hop into the ""great recession simulator"". Republican candidate responds by cutting taxes and removing regulations. Democrat responds by bailouts and expanding g the safety net. Unless the simulator can actually evaluate the impact those policies, it's no better than a debate question.

Then they hop in the ""Iran is about to get a nuclear bomb"" simulator. They both draft potential agreements to put forth to Iran and other countries. What now? Can the simulator say if that deal will be accepted? Can it evaluate if the deal is enforceable? Again, it's the results that are interesting, and if the simulator can't deliver them it's just an expensive interview question.

Maybe I'm just thinking about this the wrong way though. Can you give an example of what this would look like in practice?","What an interesting proposition!

* **Why would nominees sign up for this?**

As far as I can tell, this method is far more likely to highlight the shortcoming of a candidate's abilities than the standard debates. I can't see any candidates (except the fringe ones) being masochistic enough for something like this. An additional problem is that since they're on camera, they still wouldn't behave the way they would in a real situation. They know this, and so do we.

* **Reliance on media**

The WaPo article still stresses that it'll be the journalists who analyze the simulation results for everyone else. How does that remove the ideological bias that's present in the current system? The Democratic supporters would get their analysis from a liberal source, while the Republican supporters would still choose their own source. It's still NPR vs. Fox, just a step removed.

* **Evaluation of successful simulation**

This is a big one. A lot of these situations would have to deal with emergency scenarios, not long-term matters. So perhaps it would be useful to see how a candidate handles a shooting at an Army base, but it tells us nothing about their ability to negotiate with Iran. It would favour those who can handle emergencies better, while possibly ignoring the more diplomat-type candidates.

That took a while to write up...",B,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A raises valid points about the limitations of using simulations to evaluate presidential candidates. It highlights the fact that simulations may not be able to accurately predict the outcomes of a candidate's proposed policies in real-world scenarios. This challenges the original poster's idea that crisis simulations would be a more effective way to evaluate candidates for the presidency.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on logistical and practical challenges of implementing crisis simulations for evaluating candidates. While these points are valid, they do not directly address the original poster's argument about the effectiveness of crisis simulations compared to debates.

Overall, Reply A provides a more direct and critical analysis of the original poster's proposal, making it more likely to change their view."
predict-explain,"So, it's obvious to anyone who took a math class that the average number of sex partners between straight men and straight women **must** be the same.

According to the CDC, the median number of **opposite-sex** partners in a lifetime is **6.6** for men, and **4.3** for women. Basic mathematics concludes this: Take two sets of numbers (set M and set F). M and F have the same mean, but F has a smaller median than M. Therefore, the numbers in M are more balanced across the board than the numbers in F.

Not quite. The TOTAL number should be the same between the two groups, but if there are different numbers of people in each group, then the average will be slightly different. Nitpicky, but still.

&gt;Basic mathematics concludes this: Take two sets of numbers (set M and set F). M and F have the same mean, but F has a smaller median than M. Therefore, the numbers in M are more balanced across the board than the numbers in F.

How do you figure? Here's a counterexample: 5 different women have 4, 4, 4, 4, and 4 sexual partners, respectively. This is an average of 4, and a median of 4. Meanwhile, 5 different men have 0, 5, 5, 5, and 5 sexual partners, respectively. This is also an average of 4, but a median of 5.

Reply A provides a clear counterexample to the original poster's claim that the numbers in set M are more balanced across the board than the numbers in set F. By providing a scenario where men have a larger median than women, even though the average is the same, Reply A challenges the original poster's assumption and demonstrates that the relationship between averages and medians is not as straightforward as initially stated. 

In contrast, Reply B simply provides different average numbers for men and women without directly addressing the original poster's argument about the relationship between averages and medians. While the statistics presented in Reply B are relevant, they do not directly refute the original poster's claims about the balance of numbers in each set. 

Therefore, Reply A is more persuasive in challenging the original poster's view and is more likely to prompt them to reconsider their stance."
predict-explain,"Where a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible.  There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as the worst pizza you can find in a restaurant.

I have searched for years trying to find frozen pizza that's half as good as even Little Caesar's, but to no avail.  I've come to terms with the fact that every variety has low-quality sauce and not enough cheese.  What I can't stand, however, and definitely the most common flaw, is the terrible, *terrible* crust, which ends up either undercooked or bone dry, without fail.

I understand that pizza can only be properly cooked using a pizza stone, but it completely baffles me that this is the best we can do without one in 2015.","The Totino's little party pizzas are wonderful. They are admittedly horrible, but they are also wonderfully horrible. It's like a train wreck in your mouth. 

Little Ceasars is also far from the worst pizza you can find from a pizzeria. I stumbled into a place in Chicago that appeared to have not known the difference between salt and sugar when making their sauce. Side note from another place: If you are going to put out garlic salt instead of garlic powder... warn us. 

Little Ceasars, Dominoes, Pizza Hut etc. are all mediocre pizza places. Most chains are. But there are definitely some places that long to serve pizza, really longing to have a pizza because they have only heard of them by rough description. 

For frozen if you look at the Jacks/ Tombstone/ Red Baron types... these are absolutely what you are talking about. Light on the cheese, heavy on the lack of taste. 

These also sell for about $3 a pie. The cost of a slice at a good place. 

But you want to move up in quality. So you think Di'giorno or Freschetta.. but these are made by the same companies as the shitty ones listed above with the same idea... which is to make pizza really cheap. Most pizza toppings also don't survive freezing very well. Which is why there is a lot of compromise in quality. 

However if you are in a store that puts a lot of effort and branding into their store brand (Wegmans in the northeast comes to mind)... their frozen pizza, and all of their store branded items are made to re-enforce the brand of the store. Which is why their name is all over the packaging instead of having an ""Exclusive brand"" like ""Everyday essentials"". 

Those are going to be the frozen pizzas that have the best chance of not just being a decent frozen meal, but also being a decent pizza. Different from a pizzeria but just as good on a quality scale. (The aforementioned Wegmans pizzas always struck me as a little floury and not as greasy as the closest pizzerias to me growing up. But very close to one of the upscale pizzerias I found on Chicago's Michigan Avenue)

You might want to also look into picking up a frozen pizza (mailed directly to you) from Chicagos ""Giordanos"". It is as close as I've come to getting good pizzeria quality pizza from frozen. Also about the same cost as getting it in the store.

You're not going to get a NYC pizzeria quality pie from frozen though. The hand tossed dough etc. just isn't replicable in the large scale assembly line demanded by frozen. But then again.. you're not going to get that NYC quality in most of the country from a pizzeria anyway.","I disagree with you, but this sounds like a personal opinion on taste than an actual viewpoint.

Sometimes little ceasers ""hot and ready"" Pizzas are not exactly fresh, I have had some shitty pizzas from there (and some amazing ones).

I would say that the delissio rising crust when cooked properly and fresh out of the oven is superior to the lower tier of little ceasers hot and ready pizzas. Mainly because of the immediacy you can eat the pizza from the oven.

Yes the frozen crust is always worst. I just don't eat it.",A,A,"I would say reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a detailed explanation of different frozen pizza brands and suggests trying a specific brand (Wegmans) that may offer a better quality frozen pizza option. The user also mentions Giordano's frozen pizza as a closer option to pizzeria quality. This reply shows a good understanding of the frozen pizza market and offers practical advice for finding a better quality frozen pizza. On the other hand, reply B seems to focus more on personal taste preferences and experiences rather than providing a comprehensive analysis of the frozen pizza options available."
predict-explain,"To clarify my title I believe that having an abortion is unjustifiable unless the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or child, or the child is the product of rape. I understand that this is a touchy topic so I'm sorry if what I'm saying comes off as offensive. That is not my intention. My main reasoning is basically this.
Human life is incredibly valuable. It is a guarantor of all other forms of rights, or it at least allows for the possibility of other rights. As such the maximization of life should take precedence to other considerations, such as the right to choose whether or not you want to terminate a pregnancy. 80% or more of all pregnancies in the united states will be successful, and pursuing an abortion just decreases the amount of possible lives.

To clarify my point here is a thought experiment. Say you have a 2 year old child and a woman who is pregnant. no one would argue that killing the 2 year old is wrong. No matter how humanely it happens, you are robbing the child of the years of life it could have had. having an abortion in my opinion is just as wrong because the 2 year old and the unborn child have almost the same likelihood to live out a full life and taking that away from either of them would be morally unjustifiable.

Also, the woman giving birth wouldn't have to take care of the child. contrary to popular belief, in recent years the number of children being put up for adoption has [steadily been decreasing,](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/15/us-adoption-domestic-waits-idUSBRE90E15Y20130115) while the time it takes for those who want to adopt a child has steadily been increasing, with some couples waiting up to seven years.

As a note my stance here has nothing to do with any sort of spiritual beliefs. Also I'm left leaning on most issues so it has nothing to do with party alliances. please CMV!

An unborn fetus, while it may be ""human"" doesn't meet the criteria for personhood in most situations.

Many popular arguments involve the idea that human life isn't necessarily valueable, but *personhood* is. And that whatever it is that people value about human life - it's really just personhood that they are actually valuing.

&gt; you are robbing the child of the years of life it could have had. having an abortion in my opinion is just as wrong because the 2 year old and the unborn child have almost the same likelihood to live out a full life and taking that away from either of them would be morally unjustifiable.

Killing a child/adult (usually) involves killing them against their will/choice. That's usually considered murder. An unborn child has no will and is incapable of choice, however. This is an important distinction - and the one many think is the relevant distinction.

You also can't attempt to maximize potential life... otherwise it would be ""wrong"" to masturbate and waste sperm... in fact, it would be wrong for women not to be pregnant all the time after puberty. A woman who has only 2 kids vs having 12 kids is depriving 10 potential humans of life! But this is a nonsensical path down a road with a very silly end. 

There is nothing intrinsically ""right"" about maximizing the quantity of human life - and if you believe otherwise, then I'd like to hear an argument for it.","Why do you we disregard the life of the unborn child if the pregnancy was the result of a rape? Why does how the fetus was conceived influence the rights we give it? You can't hold the argument that human holds importance over anything else and then make an exception in the same paragraph. 

Furthermore, it seems like in society we ascribe rights to conscious beings, rather then those that are just alive. For example, it is legal to terminate a life of a brain dead patient? It seems to make more sense to determine rights base on agency. A fetus is just a clump of cells, it doesn't think, have memories, or an identity. A woman does, a woman shouldn't be forced to carry a pregnancy to term because it carries a heavy, even in the modern day.",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A presents a strong argument by pointing out the distinction between valuing human life and valuing personhood. The idea that personhood is what is truly valued in society, rather than simply human life, challenges the original poster's belief that maximizing life should take precedence over other considerations. Additionally, the argument about the absurdity of trying to maximize potential life by not wasting sperm or constantly being pregnant after puberty effectively counters the original poster's stance. 

Reply B, on the other hand, focuses more on questioning the original poster's inconsistency in making exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape, rather than directly addressing the core argument about the value of human life. While the point about agency and consciousness is valid, it doesn't directly challenge the original poster's belief as effectively as Reply A does. 

Overall, Reply A provides a more compelling and logical argument that is likely to make the original poster reconsider their stance on abortion."
predict-explain,"I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my friends or the people who have gone through that with family or people in general.


As I was walking with my date (M) through town, a group of college students started laughing at us for holding hands. As we were walking by, I kept thinking of all the ways I could get them to stop because if they were to laugh at us, who else are they gonna make feel humiliated or disgusting. I felt like a pet. Some play toy. And that my life was humorous to other people.


I can't say that there would be anything to say or do to make them realize that it's normal to appeal to the same sex. I'm ALL FOR education. I believe education makes the world go around and it's so perfect to learn abd understand new things about the world AND be open minded to everything. 


However, when I see a group of people act ignorantly, I can't help but clench my fist and think about raising hell in their life. The people they are are the kind that take pleasure in hurting people. Why? Because they want to do it for themselves. They can only think about themselves and that they're more perfect than everyone else.


I sure as hell am not perfect. I resort to violence when it comes down to this topic. But when I hear or see ignorance made to hurt others, like this (https://youtu.be/1df_i26wh-w). I can't help but feel like this ignorance needs to be dealt with a punch in the face. Nobody deserves what I got. And nobody deserves the ignorance others recieve.


Ignorance stems from close mindedness, which is something in this world we don't need. If we were all close minded, we wouldn't have advanced as far as we have. Do we really need more of it in this world? Is it necessary for our survival? I believe so to the extent that when there is an absolutely close minded person,there is an equally absolutely open minded person (the bell curve).


So to deal with these people is to punish them with hurt nowhere near the pain they've inflicted onto people, while still sending a message. CMV


Edit: I know violence won't get me anywhere. Are there any other solutions besides time, education and ignorng other people that can remedy the situation more directly?","So from what I gather from your story, you wanted these people to be physically punished because they....hurt your feelings? I understand fighting (in a literal sense) for rights and equality under the law, but you aren't entitled to live in a world where people don't judge you. 

What you consider ""ignorance"" might be completely different from what someone else considers ignorant. A vegan might see meat eaters as being ignorant for causing pain and suffering to animals. But a meat eater may see a vegan as being closed-minded by judging people for the manner in which they obtain a basic human necessity. You can't label a certain opinion (and a group that holds that opinion) as ""ignorant"" and deserving of violence because you simply don't hold the authority to decide which opinions qualify as ignorant. And what about the people who are quietly ignorant? They may not openly laugh at you on the street but they still think of you as scum and spread their agenda. Do they deserve violence too? Even though they've done nothing but have an opinion?

Again, you do not have the right to live in a world where people don't judge you. But people do have the right to an opinion, and they should not be subject to violent repercussions just because they hold that opinion.

Lastly, how do you fix ignorance? That's like asking how do I fix people's opinions who don't agree with mine? You don't. Let them have their shitty opinions, and choose not to give them the time of day.","Lets start with ignorance, because I believe you're not representing it properly, and aren't fully thinking through the implications of what your suggesting.

Ignorance does not stem from closed mindedness, but rather, lack of knowledge. You, and every other human on earth are ignorant about many things in the world. Being ignorant has no effect on your openness to new ideas, in fact, people who are ignorant could be considered a blank slate. Perhaps a better word for this would be inconsiderate or insensitive?


Being closed minded is essentially being resistant to change, and that's not always a bad thing. Skepticism is a healthy thing, and in certain circumstances, it makes sense to adjust your willingness to be persuaded. It is in some ways necessary to our survival, and has been a factor in allowing us to survive this long.


As for punishing ignorance, that's not a proportional response. People's brains are not capable of comprehending everything that's happening in the world, and ignorance is necessary. The weight of all of the suffering, sadness, and tragedy in the world is not something people are equipped to actually all comprehend at once.


peoples instincts and emotions do strongly influence them. You're desire to use violence is a perfect example of that. I agree that in our current society, mistreatment of homosexuals is a serious issue, and we should be educating the ignorant, and attempting to persuade the insensitive, but that doesn't mean we should expect ignorance to away completely.",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B provides a more nuanced and thoughtful explanation of the concept of ignorance and closed-mindedness. It also addresses the potential implications and consequences of resorting to violence as a response to ignorance. Reply B acknowledges the complexity of human behavior and beliefs, and suggests a more constructive approach to addressing ignorance through education and persuasion. Overall, Reply B presents a more reasoned and logical argument that is likely to resonate with the original poster."
predict-explain,"I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it (""It's the oldest profession""; ""we should have full rights to our bodies"") don't hold up too well, neither do a lot of the arguments against it. **(As a side note, I'll be referring to women but all these arguments could reliably be applied to male prostitutes for the most part)**

One of the most oft-touted arguments that I seem to see is that ""Women will be forced into prostitution because they have no other options"".

I fail to see this as a legitimate concern. Not because I don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because I don't see how this is a bad thing. If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental *and* physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?

If I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because ""Desperate people might feel obligated to work them"", would that make sense? I don't think so. A McJob is a McJob, and a McBlowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. One could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. The only argument I could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which I concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, I'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.

I think a regulated, safe, and well-operated system of brothels (and only brothels, to ensure there are no dangers to streetwalkers/regulations can be easily enforced) would reduce the amount of dangers as well as offer additional opportunities. To clarify, this system would involve:

&gt;Similar regulations to the porn industry (mandatory screening for all workers, 100% condom use by 'johns', provided and required birth control, contracts either requiring abortion/absolving the secondary party of any/all liability and responsibility, physically and financially, in the unlikely event (but by law of large numbers unpreventable) double failure of condoms and birth control.

&gt;Protection, both on and immediately off of brothel grounds, by well-maintained security forces.

&gt;New legislation that ensures any fraud or intentional failure to pay (in the event some brothel didn't take money up front) constitutes rape.

&gt;Harsh crackdowns and harsher penalties for pimping, street walkers, and other institutions (""Massage parlors""). Death penalties/life sentences (where it isn't already) for human trafficking and sexual slavery, all the way down the ladder, and rehabilitation for victims of this.

(Actually, that last one would be good with or without legalized, but whatever).

**What I'd like to see to Change My View (in addition to any logical moral/emotional arguments):**

-Studies on legalization that prove it's not safe/causes societal repercussions more severe than the benefits.

-Studies on lack of effects (or worsening) of street prostitutes/pimp culture.

-Anything else relevant to disprove anything I've said here.

**What I would not like to see:**

-Outright moral arguments (""Selling your body is wrong"", anonymous/casual sex is a sin)

-Any arguments I listed above without additions (""Women will be forced into sex slavery"")

-Religious arguments

Not because I don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because I don't see how this is a bad thing. If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental and physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?

I think this is a simplistic view - Let's be honest and not politically correct - Providing sex services to strangers is not the same simple task as flipping burgers, cleaning stairwells and cooking, cleaning etc. Having sex has impact on people not because of taboo but because it is the most intimate act you can have with someone and it obligates you to share yourself at least physically with someone else. The problem with no other options available is that prostitution is not as easy as other jobs. Certainly it may be easy to please most Johns, that's not the issue, the issue is that it's not an easy call. Can you imagine yourself working for the sex industry and being required to do a certain amount of dirty things with whoever shows up, as your only option for survival? 

Yes, it is better than being homeless but it's troubling that people need to provide sex services to survive. It's not easy. I actually have a friend who worked in escorting - The payment is great so it was overall a good experience, but she described as being harsh specially on the psychological side because it's not easy to have sex with strangers and do most things they require

&gt;If I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because ""Desperate people might feel obligated to work them"", would that make sense? I don't think so. A McJob is a McJob, and a McBlowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. One could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. The only argument I could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which I concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, I'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.

I agree that it's taboo, but as I said it's not just that - For some people it is easy to have sex for strangers, for others it's not. Being a man myself, I don't like having sex with strangers and I prefer to be committed first - It's a preference (before you ask, no I'm not religious). For most people, having sex with anyone who asks for it is not an easy task.


I am divided on prostitution - But I believe it should be decriminalized at least. My problem with regulating fully is that there's no evidence that it does solve the issues it promises to solve. 

If you are open to changing your mind, read this 

http://www.embracedignity.org/uploads/10Reasons.pdf

Regardless of who wrote it and which websites host that paper you should take a look. Most of all, my problem is that street prostitution, pimping, abuse and trafficking have not disappeared. Yes, health wise things are improving, but don't you think it's curious that a significant part of Amsterdam's prostitutes are foreigners/immigrants? Do you think it's ok that the majority of prostitutes according to many studies start before the age of 18? Do you think legalizing and regulating will erase issues? I'm not exactly concerned about bodily autonomy or stigmas, but with the workers themselves. The fact you need to do something to survive doesn't mean that activity is good for you.","I agree that sex work should be legal, but your methods don't seem like they would be sufficient for harm reduction. Because of the high up front cost of running and regulating a brothel, you'd see them institute a robust hiring process that would screen out many current sex workers for a variety of reasons, perhaps most commonly the fact that they arE homeless, undocumented, or simply  won't look ""good"" enough to attract brothel customers. So you'll still have a thriving trade of street based sex work etc. that will actually provide exactly zero extra protection for the sex workers who will still be a exactly as much risk of being thrown in jail as they were before legalization.",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides a more nuanced perspective on the issue of prostitution, highlighting the psychological and emotional impact of engaging in sex work. It also raises important points about the potential negative consequences of legalizing and regulating prostitution, such as the continued existence of street-based sex work and the potential exclusion of marginalized individuals from regulated brothels.

Reply A also references a resource for the original poster to consider, which adds credibility to the argument presented. Overall, Reply A presents a more comprehensive and thoughtful analysis of the issue, addressing both the personal and societal implications of legalizing prostitution."
predict-explain,"I've learned about the concept of the hedonistic treadmill (by myself not by reading the wikipedia page). In short: The more you enjoy something, the more you'll get used to it, and the less you'll enjoy it!

Consequently, in life things like, say, videogames, make you used to high levels of stimulation, making everything else in life seem dull and boring.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, that is except for the fact that videogames are like 99% useless, and consequently you could have similar amounts of fun, on average, after getting used to the usual amounts of stimulation you can find in real life, with the plus that you get a lot more time and energy for things like your education and career, your social and love life, and any hobby or intellectual interest you have!

Even in small amounts videogames drain the fun out of life and take a large amount of time and energy, without giving anything back, at all.

Conclusively, videogames are bad, and society would be better off without them.

Starcraft taught me some of the most valuable and useful lessons in my life that have helped me achieve my successes.
things I learned from starcraft:

* how structure can create freedom
* how to lose
* how to set reasonable expectations
* how to break problems down into small area's and find small things to improve that will have large scale effects.
* It definitely improved my under pressure decision making
* It helped me realize that sometime's you just need to give up.


The souls series has taught me a lot of things as well: 

* how to analyze my surroundings and improve my ability to problem solve under pressure or external forces
* how to use failure to learn and develop required skills
* the importance of being prepared
* greatly improved my navigation skills

Dota has been a great social experience, and that in and of itself has value, as much value as watching a movie or playing cards with friends, it's also taught me about leadership, teamwork, delegation, and morale.

Applying these concepts to the rest of my life has worked very effectively, and I credit these games in part for much of my current life.",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B provides specific examples of how video games have had a positive impact on the user's life, such as teaching valuable lessons and skills that have contributed to their successes. By highlighting the practical benefits and lessons learned from playing video games, Reply B effectively challenges the original poster's assertion that video games are ""99% useless"" and argues for the value that video games can bring to one's life. On the other hand, Reply A's argument is more general and does not provide concrete examples to counter the original poster's claims."
predict-explain,"Clearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. 

1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit whiny, perhaps because is is too close to ""why.""

2. Exclusivity. Only about 300 words in English start with X. Y starts over 700 (per Wolfram-Alpha, and this appears to include proper nouns). X appears in only 0.15% of English words, while Y appears in far more. I could not find an estimated percentage, but so many adverbs end in ""ly"" that it rather proves my point. Even though it's so exclusive, it is so much more versatile, as shown below.

3. Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind. 

4. Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4). 

5. Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable. 

6. Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze. 

7. Sex. Our favorite word not only has X right in it, but the whole last 2/3 of the word sounds like saying X. Y? Nowhere to be found, unless it tags along to make something sexy. Not to mention the uses of XXX, and the fact that fairer sex is made up of X chromosomes. Y gives us baldness, hairy backs, and emotional immaturity. 

8. History. Malcolm X, not Malcolm Y. There's even ""American History X.""

9. Versatility in other areas. X can be used to show that something is crossed out, used as a check mark to indicate the choice on a form, used in cartoons to show that a person is dead, used in medicine (x-rays), used to show treasure on a map, 

10. = X. 

11. ~~No one has ever died in a state spelled with an X. Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, and Wyoming combine for 10% of the deaths in the US each year~~ I somehow came up with the 4 Y states off the top of my head and also thought there were no X states. New Mexico and Texas. 

12. If you're talking about unknown items, you always say ""X is better than Y,"" never ""Y is better than X"". 


EDIT: It worked. I was forced to rethink some of my strongest points. I still may think that X is better, but I can see that Y has its merits and can sometimes be even superior. Very clever responses in many cases, and I'm afraid I'll be banned for giving out too many deltas to people who make me rethink each point.

I want to take a different approach.

While X may be better than Y, I want to change your view that this is irrelevant. M is superior to both, and that is more important in your life.

1. Pronunciation. M is easy to say, not too harsh, not too soft. Saying, ""Mmmmm"" describes deliciousness. It is so great that it is often the first sound a baby makes.

2. Restrained Popularity. M is a pretty popular letter, but not overused. It is right around the middle of the [letter frequency chart in English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency#Relative_frequencies_of_letters_in_the_English_language). M is a common but not overused first-letter as well, in part because it is such a pleasant sound to make. Mmmm. Furthermore, while neither X nor Y are present in all languages, M is universal on [this chart on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency#Relative_frequencies_of_letters_in_other_languages), and it retains a solid medium frequency between 2% and 5%. Used, but not overused.

3. Consistency. M is also always a consonant. X cannot make up its mind regarding the sound it makes. Zuh? Chi? What is it, X?

4. Scrabble. M, with its restrained popularity, is a happy tile to come across. You get a middling number of points (3) but what you lack in points you more than make up for in usability. Sometimes you can even use more than one M in the same word! Can you say Double Letter Score? Thanks M!

5. Use in math. M is the first letter of the word math. You are welcome. End of discussion. 

6. Appearance. M is such a beautiful form that we have modelled other letters after it: W is an upside-down M with some sharpness and E is a sideways M with some flatness. We even find the influence of its beauty in numbers as 3 is a sideways M with more roundness. Marvellous.

7. Sex. Mmmm, sex is good. How do you get sex? Money. Boom.

8. History. Malcolm X, not Xalcolm X. History museums, not xuseuxs. The second millennium, not xillenniux. You practically cannot even say words with X properly.

9. Versatility in other areas. Without the M in medicine there would be no x-rays, and without a ""M""ap there would be no treasure.

10. ≠ X

11. What is the best school in the world? Harvard. Where is that? Massachusetts. Thanks brains.

12. When one understands the value of M there is no need to talk about ""unknown items"". You know M, and M is all one must know.

Bonus: If you search for ""M is the best letter"" on Google you will find about 610,000,000 results. ""X is the best letter"" returns a paltry 560,000,000 results (not to mention ""Y is the best letter"" at a pitiful 392,000,000 results)  
M is the head of M6 in James Bond.  
The Christian God picked a woman named ""M""ary to bear his son.  
The Hindu Mahabarata starts with ""M"".","In your arguments you make a lot of assumptions about what better means. For instance you presume that rarity is 'better' than versatility.  The letter Y is far more versatile than the letter X, it can be used in many more words and is flexible enough to stand in for vowels when using them makes a word look horrible.  On that basis the letter Y also has great aesthetic appeal.

You assume that consistency is better when versatility could just as easily be argued to be better.

You assume that having the word ex in sex is good, but in order to describe the magnitude of sex something exudes you need to add the y on the end (sexy).

Number 11 is just plan false as I'm sure many people die each year in Texas, and New Mexico.",A,A,"I would say that reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B raises valid points about the assumptions made in the original post, such as the presumption that rarity is better than versatility, consistency is better than versatility, and the assumption that certain aspects automatically make something better. Additionally, reply B provides examples to support their arguments, such as the aesthetic appeal of the letter Y and how it can stand in for vowels in certain situations.

Overall, reply B challenges the original poster's views and provides a more nuanced perspective on the topic, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"**tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting?**

I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to sports, I know more and watch more than any of my peers through work, school, or friendship. I like hockey, baseball, and the NFL. But regular season games are boring.

Boring can be good sometimes. A casual baseball game on a lazy afternoon is amazing, and it's great in the background during a family gathering. Seeing a game in person is awesome and regular season games are perfect for that because if you miss a play it's not the end of the world. I find the NFL regular season *almost* engaging because of the short schedule. I understand that in the NHL and MLB you need to play more games so the gap between 1st and last is sufficiently large, so I'm not suggesting shorter schedules. I would just really like someone to make regular season games more exciting for me.

The NHL is my favorite by far, but I can't stand regular season games. Until the very end of the season it just feels like watching practice. There's no excitement. It's like a 10 cent bet. Until the end of the season, very little is on the line. I don't see the appeal.

So can someone explain it to me? When I ask my friends who do watch the regular season they get condescending.","While the thrill of every game being a ""do or die"" situation isn't always there, I think if you're a true fan of the game, then regular season games are fun for their own reason.  Sure, it's a bit like practice, but you're watching it for the strategy.  You're watching it for the athletic ability.  You're watching it to see how the management is playing the long game (Do they use a pitcher today in the 13th inning, or save him for his start tomorrow?)

Seeing a guy make an amazing play at shortstop, or seeing a guy shoot the puck past 3 defenders from the blue line is just as awesome no matter when you see it.  

Then there's the rivalries.  I'm always going to be happy to watch the Flyers lose, no matter what.  And lately (lol), the playoffs don't give me that opportunity much.","MLB - It's a pass time, baseball is a long, slow grind that builds up gradually and doesn't matter much until the end of the season, this falls into your view of ""not mattering a whole lot""

NHL - Also my favorite sport, and depending on your team there are three categories that they'll fall into: Obviously making it into the playoffs (Chicago, Anaheim, Tampa, Pittsburgh). Obviously *not* making the playoffs (New Jersey, Arizona, Philadelphia, Toronto, whatever the expansion teams will be), and finally bubble teams (Ottowa, Columbus, Minnesota, Edmonton^maybe , Buffalo^maybe^unlikely )

For the ""gonna make it"" teams, there isn't much on the line other than home ice advantage, though that doesn't mean much, so the big thing is seeing the team progress and develop and making sure players are healthy, not terribly compelling.

For the bubble teams, this is where it gets interesting, you're talking about battles *all season long*, the wins *matter* when the team is only 2 points out of the wild card, the last 2 months of the season are frantic, with everyone trying to fight their way into the playoffs, for some people it's as good as playoff hockey from February on.

For the ""obviously not gonna make it"" teams, the regular season matters the *most* to them! It's all they have and if the team realizes it early enough and there's a highly touted prospect on the board next season (like Austin Matthews) it's incredibly important that the team does poorly. I'm a Sabres fan and this last season was one of the most tense and compelling I've watched in years, because they *needed* to finish last.

So in the NHL for the majority of the teams at least half of the regular season is extremely important for either making the playoffs, or getting into last for the best chance at the top draft pick.

NFL - 

I saved this for last because I almost can't believe that you feel the games are important. There are only 16 games each season! Any single game can and does mean the difference between making the playoffs and going home at the end of December. 

Even if a team is bad games have *massive* implications because drafting is so important in the NFL.

Compared to baseball or hockey, each NFL game counts for 10 baseball games, or 5 NHL games, all in one day! You have the majority of the games against teams that are constant rivals, that are battling for just 2 or 3 playoff spots available.

So much in the NFL can swing on one weekend that it's almost *too* important!

TL:DR - I pretty much agree with baseball, but the NHL and especially the NFL every single game matters for most teams.",B,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more in-depth analysis of why regular season games in the NHL and NFL are important and exciting. It breaks down the different scenarios for teams in each league and explains how every game can have significant implications for playoff positioning or draft picks. This detailed explanation may help the original poster see regular season games in a new light and understand their importance beyond just the final standings. Reply A, while also offering valid points, does not go into as much depth or provide as much context as Reply B."
predict-explain,"I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I can't think of anything redeeming about makeup. 

1) It takes forever to put on. I feel like this is most of the reason women are given a reputation for taking ages to ready themselves, and given that I think it's unnecessary, it's actually a waste of time no matter how long it takes.

2) It's harmful. Not only physically, where it may causes skin problems, headaches, premature aging, cancer, allergies, other skin diseases, and other things, but it can be harmful to the self-image of the woman wearing makeup, making them dependent upon the makeup, feeling ugly without it, etc.

3) It's disingenuous. I think of it as false advertising. Celebrities are a big indication of this to me, many of them don't look particularly nice without makeup on, and with regular women the drop in attractiveness without makeup is generally even more noticeable.

This is all that comes to mind at the moment.

But I'd argue that it's not harmful to a woman's self image, and that it being disingenuous is not necessarily a bad thing. To me, the makeup makes them feel beautiful. They may feel ugly without it, but the makeup being disingenuous is then a good thing. Makeup could give them confidence and a self-esteem boost that they would not have without it. Many women like wearing makeup, and I think it's because they like how they look while wearing it. That makes it a good thing.","&gt; regular women can go from attractive to unattractive at the swipe of a brush.

So they're using makeup incorrectly? Is your view that while makeup makes celebrities look nice, it works the opposite way for the average woman?

&gt; It takes forever to put on.

It depends. A lot of women take less than two minutes to adjust their makeup because a lot of them don't like heavy makeup.

&gt; but it can be harmful to the self-image of the woman wearing makeup, making them dependent upon the makeup, feeling ugly without it, etc.

Again, not necessarily true at all. Wearing makeup makes a lot of women feel more attractive because men do have a strong reaction to it. [Men, on average, rate women with makeup as more attractive; they also tip more generously to women who wear makeup](http://journal.scconline.org/pdf/cc2011/cc062n03/p00283-p00290.pdf)",B,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"I’m a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find silly/trivial. I’m currently dating a girl who is a VERY strong feminist. Over the weekend we were playing Mario Kart 64 and for as long as I can remember my go to character for Nintendo games has been Peach. There’s really no particular reason I do this other than I seem to do the best with Peach.

When I won the grand prix my girlfriend said “Ugh, I hate Peach, she’s such a weak and stereotypical female video game character.” To which I jokingly replied “Wow, that’s a SUPER sexist thing to say, and she’s obviously not that weak since I crushed you with her.” And her response to that was “Peach negatively reinforces the idea that women are weak and can only be saved by men in power like Mario.”

Then I made the mistake of saying “Well I don’t think that’s true.” We ended up getting into an argument over the portrayal of females in video games and how that perpetuates stereotypes in the real world. Her main argument was that most females in video games are portrayed as weak and need help from the male characters and this is detrimental to women in real life.

There were two issues I had with her argument, the first one being that there are a TON of badass female characters in video games who don’t need no man: Samus, Rosalina, Zelda/Sheik, Palutena, Bayonetta, Lara Croft, Ellie from the last of us, and GLaDOS (just to get a female villain in there). She shrugged this off by saying it’s still not enough because male protagonist characters outnumber female characters in video games. I feel like she wouldn’t be happy unless the numbers of male and female characters are exactly equal.

The second, and main issue I had with her argument is even if all female characters were represented as weak and helpless, I sincerely doubt there is any correlation between these characters and real world issues for women. For me video games are make believe, fiction, and stories. They’re imaginary worlds with imaginary characters. Saying the portrayal of women in video games perpetuates real societal problems for women (like pay inequality) is about as absurd to me as saying violence in video games perpetuates violence in real life, which from what I can tell [has been thoroughly debunked](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-33466-001/). Most reasonable people realize that women don’t wear bright pink dresses, pick vegetables with faces out of the ground, and get kidnapped from a giant turtle/dinosaur hybrid.

I provided my argument, and also said if Mario’s and Peach’s roles were reversed I could seriously not care less, as long as the game was still fun. Her response was “You won’t ever understand because you’re a guy.” I tried to continue on the debate but was met with the same response every time: “You won’t ever understand because you’re a guy.”

So here I am trying to change my view, while I may not agree with the feminist issue of women in video games, I feel like I’m more empathetic than what my girlfriend is giving me credit for. Have there been studies done about the portrayal of women in video games/stories and their effects on society? Is there any hard evidence for this correlation? 

EDIT: Yes, I get it, some people's feelings are hurt that Princess Peach is portrayed the way she is, and while making people upset IS a negative effect, this is not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for more of an impact than ""It's bad cause ma feelings are hurt""

Presumably, because feminism is a thing, it makes *many* people upset. Sadness is a bad thing, so something that makes a lot of people sad has a negative effect on society, even if it's a small one.

I don't think video games *cause* this, they just represent it.  The problem is that by repeating this figure they make it much harder to change, so it perpetuates it.  How much harder?

Reply B addresses the issue of representation in video games and how it reflects societal norms and values. It acknowledges that video games may not directly cause these issues, but they do perpetuate them by reinforcing certain stereotypes. By framing the discussion in this way, it highlights the importance of representation and the impact it can have on shaping attitudes and beliefs in society. 

On the other hand, Reply A focuses more on the emotional impact of these portrayals, which may not be as convincing to someone who views video games as purely fictional and separate from real-world issues. While emotions are important, the argument presented in Reply B provides a more nuanced and thought-provoking perspective on the issue at hand."
predict-explain,"Rock and Roll music is no longer an important part of the cultural conversation. This is obviously not to say that there is no longer rock music being made, that that music is never popular, or that that contemporary rock music isn't good. But rock has become similar to jazz and classical—while there is still lots of it being made, it's not a powerful cultural force any more. The modern cultural conversation is being played out in hip-hop and EDM.

Of the current Top 10 on the Billboard charts, the only rock single is ""Shut Up and Dance"" by Walk the Moon, at #9, and that song is heavily influenced by EDM. The current Song of the Summer is generally agreed to be Fetty Wap's ""Trap Queen."" The most consistently popular rock band currently is probably either the Foo Fighters, a band that has been around since the late 90s and still plays a very similar style of music to what they were playing then (and arguably still owe a large portion of their popularity to nostalgia for Nirvana, a band whose largest cultural moment was 24 years ago), or the Black Keys, a band playing with a deliberately retro style. 

Tame Impala and Arcade Fire, two bands that have been lauded for their innovation in the rock genre have on their most recent albums embraced EDM influences, and largely moved away from guitar-based rock. 

I would argue that the most culturally important albums of the past few months have been outside of rock—Kendrick Lamar's *To Pimp A Butterfly*, Drake's *If You're Reading This It's Too Late*, Mark Ronson's *Uptown Special*, Taylor Swift's *1989* (in which she ditched her country roots for an embrace of EDM pop).

There has been a lot of rock music recently that has been great too (Father John Misty, Courtney Barnett, Colleen Green, and Jim O'Rourke have all released albums I have absolutely loved, and I just listened to the new Titus Andronicus album yesterday) but that has become an exception, and as my examples point out, it's not really commercially popular or culturally relevant beyond a small core. 

I don't have a real problem with rock losing its cultural cachet. I love rap, R&amp;B, and electronica as well, and think that there is a lot of great innovation going on in modern music (and even that 2015 is an all-time stand-out year). But I think that rock has lost its importance in the wider culture, and that rock music is now even imbued with an inherent feeling of throwback, the way that jazz now makes people think of a certain time period even as jazz continues to innovate to this day.

Look back at the heyday of punk or prog rock or thrash metal and you'll see it was largely some version of pop that dominated the charts. Pop-punk, grunge and nu metal were largely short-lived trends (from a mainstream exposure standpoint.) Rock has always had one foot firmly in the underground, which is why its descent into irrelevance has been proclaimed in every decade. Most rock bands reach their commercial peak late in their career. Bands like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Rush and Iron Maiden weren't critical darlings at the time of their most classic albums.","IMO, rock - especially modern metal - is more ""culturally"" relevant than ever before. But it's more relevant to a different demographic; people who are connoisseurs of music and the like. It's the same move that jazz and blues made when rock became dominant in the '50s and '60s. 

The music of the masses is now hip hop, EDM and stuff like that. But stuff like metal and punk are no longer seen as lowbrow. Highbrow metal bands such as Opeth, Agalloch and Mastodon are reaching out more to college-educated audiences, like art-rock did back in the day.",B,A,"I would say Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a historical perspective on the cyclical nature of rock music's relevance in mainstream culture, pointing out that rock has always had a presence in the underground and that many classic rock bands were not necessarily critical darlings at the time of their most popular albums. This challenges the idea that rock music's decline in cultural importance is a recent phenomenon, suggesting instead that it may be a natural part of the evolution of popular music trends. 

In contrast, Reply B focuses more on the idea that rock music, particularly modern metal, is still culturally relevant but to a different demographic. While this perspective is valid, it doesn't directly address the original poster's argument about rock music losing its importance in the wider culture. Therefore, Reply A's historical context and insight into the cyclical nature of music trends may be more likely to prompt the original poster to reconsider their view."
predict-explain,"Edit: I think I may have overestimated the problem, due in part to my sources, and in part to my zealousness. Many comments so far have pointed out that even if all of this were true, it would not constitute a police state. I'm willing to give quite a bit of ground on that phrase, as I likely used it without thinking it through.

Edit 2: I'm sorry some people think I'm a shill. I'm just a concerned guy trying to help.

First Amendment

Cops can tell you what to say, taze you for arguing with them, arrest journalists, and arrest you for filming them. They can break up peaceful protests by force. They bring assault weapons to memorial services and gay rights marches and anti-war demonstrations.

[Here](http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/tag/journalist-arrested) are some stories about arrests of journalists.

Second Amendment

Most states don't seem to have tried to take your guns away, but that won't stop them from arming the police with military weapons. If the police attack you, where can you go for help? Why are the (civilian) police forces authorized to carry weapons which are illegal in the states they police? Do police really get into gunfights with heavily armed drug dealers and save the lives of crowds of law abiding citizens, like something out of a 1980's cop thriller?

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarization_of_police) is the wiki about police militarization.

Fourth Amendment

Cops can seize your property without cause or warrant (civil forfeiture), and search your car, phone, or house without cause or warrant. Don't believe me? Look it up. Multiple recent court decisions defend an officer's wish to do whatever he wants with your things.

[Here](http://www.mintpressnews.com/supreme-court-rules-police-do-not-need-a-warrant-to-search-your-home/206199/) is an article about the most recent supreme court decision on searches.

[This](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;rlz=1C1ASUC_enUS632US632&amp;es_sm=93&amp;q=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;oq=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0j0i22i30l9.269565.274940.0.275095.27.25.0.0.0.0.299.3358.0j18j2.20.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..7.20.3353.s4Q1aX2iVQY) is just a google page, but how many of these wrong house, no knock searches are too many?

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States) is the wiki about civil forfeiture.

It appears the court has ruled that police -do- need a warrant to search your cell phone.

Fifth Amendment

Cops can arrest you on the spot for literally anything they see fit, and you will be held -at least- until your bail hearing, and you will be lucky if you can afford your bail. Also, they can compel you through whatever means they see fit (lying, threatening, depriving of basic needs, torture) to bear testimony against yourself, even if you are innocent (any testimony given under duress is admissible to the court, and usually leads to conviction regardless of proof-of-guilt). Also, they fund their own departments by issuing citations and stealing property (seriously, if you haven't looked up civil forfeiture, do it now).

[Here](https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1656) is a good video where a Virginia Beach officer explains criminal 'interviews.' If you have time to really watch this, please listen to what he says, and how he says it. His job is to look for wrongdoing, and he freely admits that if he wants to pull someone over, he can follow them until they do something he can pull them over for. [This](https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1881) is where he starts to describe interrogation specifically.

Sixth Amendment

You can be kept in jail for years before you are brought before a judge, and can expect no help or information from the prison guards. Guards are there to keep people in, not to save lives. Numerous cases are rising to the public view regarding prison conditions, and maybe we should start throwing the 'cruel and unusual' term around. Either way, in 2011, about 3 people died in American jails -every day- with countless others tortured or left off the books (think Chicago's interrogation fiasco this year, or Guantanamo).

[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site) is an article about Chicago's secret prison.

[Here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/08/how-many-police-shootings-a-year-no-one-knows/) is an article about police killings. Note the fact that they aren't even tracked very carefully.

[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/27/deaths-in-jails-885-inmates) is an article about deaths in prisons. Again, information is out of date, and possibly inaccurate.

Eighth Amendment

Some Judges set reasonable bail, others do not. Some of the Judges caught setting unreasonable bail are called out, or disciplined, most are not. Chances are very good you will not be able to afford bail if you go inside. Think about that next time you're tempted to flip off a police officer.

I'm having a hard time finding specifics about the time between an arrest and a bail hearing, but pages I visit says it varies state by state, with multiple lawyers giving anecdotes of people waiting up to a year in jail before being -acquitted- because they couldn't make bail. Personally, I have known more than one person to spend months in jail after being unable to afford bail. Whether or not someone is found guilty, shouldn't this be viewed as a violation of our right to a speedy trial? Not sure about that one.

[Here](http://www.bjs.gov/content/dcf/ptrpa.cfm) are some statistics on drug bail.

[Here](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/bailfail_executive_summary.pdf) is a document full of prison statistics, most relevantly, bail rates.

Bottom line:

You don't have rights anymore. Each of the constitutional rights we have were set forth by Americans to protect their families from overzealous government officials. These rights are not there to protect you from your neighbors. They aren't there to protect you from your employer. They were written specifically to protect you from the Government, and they have failed. Remember your history, read the constitution. Every one of the rights Americans hold dear is being violated by police, judges, and politicians every day. Every Day. EVERY DAY. Every bullshit arrest, every bullshit sentence, every bullshit traffic stop, every bullshit roadside search. If you try to exercise your right to free speech, you can be stopped for it. If you argue with the officer, he will pull you out of the car for an arrest and search without warrant. If you resist him in any way, or if you can't hear him, or if you step on the brake pedal by mistake, or if you just don't fall on your face quickly enough, he will shoot you. Those are the facts.

Every year, another generation of high-school students reads 1984, by Orwell. They tell us what to buy, and at what price (medicine, insurance). They tell us our wars are moral, or economically sound. They tell us who to love (media, soldiers, 'heros'). They tell us who to hate (war, media, socialists, WBC). We are in a constant state of war on at least one front (Germany, Vietnam, Korea, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, Russia, Mexico, and God only knows where else). They lie to us, and suppress anyone looking for the truth (media, arrest of journalists, denying the right to assemble or film officers). They tell us what to believe. They tell us how to behave. They will kill you if you do not fall in line exactly when and how they tell you.

It might not look like you live in a police state. After all, you can drive to work, do your job, buy your groceries, and go on vacation. However, if a police officer, a judge, or anyone else has the authority to ignore the Constitution of the United States of America, what else can you call it? Do I need to dare you to piss off a cop? If you know what will happen when you piss off a cop, how can you accept that? Why are police even authorized to use deadly force? You really want them to kill someone for speeding? Well what about stealing your car, can we kill them then? How many lives are saved through the use of deadly force? Is it worth it?

Well it isn't worth it to me. I'm going to keep my head down until I can afford to get the Hell out of here. I'd rather Live as a citizen of the World than Die as a citizen of this country.

If you think the constitution protects you (at all), think again. They are walking all over your rights, and you aren't going to notice until they arrest you, or kill your children. If they never do, you will live your life among the sheeple, waiting for the law to tell you how to live.

I'm sorry if this comes across as somewhat belligerent, but I believe the seriousness of the situation in this country isn't exactly sinking in for the general public. Am I wrong? Is it already getting better? Are citizens safer than they used to be? Is my information wrong or biased? I would love a discussion about what we are doing right, what we are doing wrong, and what we can do next.

Like 3 months. Then come back to it. I realized what was going on then. Different portions of the media attempt to rile you up and get you angry. This earns them money. There are no saints in this world. Everybody has an angle to help them in some way. 

Think about it. Snowden is in Russia right now after leaking secrets. What did that do? Hurt a spy program and angered people across the world. Now Snowden is safe in Russia and is with the Russian government. He works with them now and probably has no problem getting what ever he desires.

That's just an example of somebody that was praised as a hero on the Internet. I'm sure I could think of plenty more.

TL;DR: You are being manipulated by the media into being angry and having beliefs molded. Not much has really changed, just adapted to modern times.",I wonder how many of these people who changed your mind are actually working for the police or government. I mean they have people who's full time job is to create profiles on social media and maintain them and keep people's focus wherever they want it. Oh isn't technology lovely.,A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A offers a suggestion to take a break from the news and then come back to it, which can help the original poster gain a different perspective and potentially see things in a different light. Additionally, Reply A points out that the media often tries to rile people up for profit, and highlights the idea that everyone has their own angle. This approach encourages the original poster to consider the influence of media manipulation and the potential biases present in the information they are consuming. Overall, Reply A provides a more thoughtful and reflective response that may prompt the original poster to reconsider their views."
predict-explain,"Translation software already exists and is pretty good. Image recognition lets you translate signs, and with voice recognition, it may be possible to have a conversation between two people who don't share a language (although it would be slow and occasionally confusing). Google translate may have its hiccups, but I can understand the majority of its translations and it's only going to get better over the next few years.

I understand that most universities (at least in the US) require some time spent in a foreign language class, but this is really part of what I am arguing against. Most people I have ever taken a foreign language class with resented being there and putting in years of effort to learn a skill they might only use a couple times in their whole life, and will likely forget.

Obviously people in some careers, like diplomats or aid workers, need to learn another language, but I just don't see how the average person will spend enough time with people who don't speak their language, in a place without an interpreter or internet access, to justify the amount of time spent learning a language.

*I am excepting English from this because so much of the Internet is available only in English.

**Edit**: /u/RustyRook changed my view by linking a study which showed that learning a language could delay onset of dementia by 4.5 years. To me, this would justify the time requirement as it often doesn't take that long to learn a language.

predict-explain,"Cabotage is the practice of allowing foreign airlines to operate domestic routes.  Currently, if your airline is not headquartered in the United States, you can't fly between two US cities.  

So Air Canada can fly a plane from Toronto to New York, but can't continue that plane on to Miami.

I think this rule is dumb and protectionist.  [Airline safety and protocols are subject to international treaties already,](https://www.faa.gov/passengers/international_travel/) and if we wanted, foreign airlines could be subjected to additional FAA safety checks as a condition of being allowed to engage in cabotage.

With the current state of the US airline industry being [so close-knit as to promote collusion,](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-doj-investigating-airlines-20150701-story.html) a healthy dose of competition seems like it's in order.  Opening up cabotage would allow a lot more competition in US aviation, which would be a big benefit to consumers as far as price.  It would also likely allow a lot of airports which aren't presently hubs to get better overseas service.  For instance, British Airways might not be able to justify a direct flight from Cleveland or St Louis to London, but it might be able to justify a flight that does St Louis - Cleveland - London.

Additionally, Reply A's example of a Chinese airline operating solely within the USA helps to illustrate the potential consequences of opening up cabotage without considering these important factors."
predict-explain,"Consent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved that what they're doing, and how they're doing it, is okay with their partner(s). Consent also allows for things that would otherwise be creepy or weird to come into a positive light and expressed in a healthy way. I would consider the act of objectifying to fall under this category. For example, a woman may be creeped out if a dude right in front of her at a party is just staring at her boobs without any concern for her at all. The same act of staring at the boobs is 100% fine if it's with her boyfriend while they're having consensual sexual relations.

If we take this same line of logic of consent that happens with sex and put it with masturbation, that's where I'm going with this. If you're thinking about another person in a sexual manner without them knowing about it, and then acting out that thought process by masturbating, it just seems a bit creepy to me. If I'm not allowed to objectify or do other sexual acts in person without having consent from the other person, I don't see how that wouldn't also translate over to masturbation. It's the same sexual thoughts, feelings, and intentions with the only difference being that the partner is not physically with you. Because they're not there with you, you can't ask for proper consent unless you physically ask them some other time if you can masturbate about them.

This line of thought has logic to it, but it's a conclusion that I don't like to face. This line of thought potentially makes masturbation an awful act if done without consent. It also makes it an act that wouldn't be allowed if no one gave any consent to you. You might be able to say that pornography that was paid for might be consensual masturbation because the model is being paid, and is therefore willing to consent to you masturbating. Even so, this doesn't allow you to explore your sexual desires outside of straight up porn unless someone says it's okay. If you asked me whether I'm for or against masturbation, I would say that I'm very pro-masturbation. The act has health benefits, relieves stress, is pleasurable, and all sorts of other fun goodies. It makes it so I don't want to come to the conclusion that I've come to that it needs strict consent about the person(s) that's involved in one's fantasies.

So please, CMV!

EDIT: After reading over the many replies I've gotten (thank you all) I think my view has already sufficiently changed. Consent with masturbation has more of a tendency to be harmful than helpful and positive. There's a difference between one's thoughts and actions, and masturbation causes no harm if the one being fantasied about isn't informed. There was also the argument that ones thoughts and fantasies should be their own, and no one else's. Control of your own thoughts is a human necessity, and putting a limit on them could be hazardous. As long as I keep a mental image of someone in tact of who they are, and not just seeing them as a sex object, I think it's all fine and dandy.

Thanks guys. I felt like I must've been wrong with my logic somewhere, and you helped point to where. I needed that. :)

It deals with unrequited love in a way that I think would be convincing. Here is a relevant quote.

Charlie Kaufman: There was this time in high school. I was watching you out the library window. You were talking to Sarah Marsh.
Donald Kaufman: Oh, God. I was so in love with her.
Charlie Kaufman: I know. And you were flirting with her. And she was being really sweet to you.
Donald Kaufman: I remember that.
Charlie Kaufman: Then, when you walked away, she started making fun of you with Kim Canetti. And it was like they were laughing at *me*. You didn't know at all. You seemed so happy.
Donald Kaufman: I knew. I heard them.
Charlie Kaufman: How come you looked so happy?
Donald Kaufman: I loved Sarah, Charles. It was mine, that love. I owned it. Even Sarah didn't have the right to take it away. I can love whoever I want.
Charlie Kaufman: But she thought you were pathetic.
Donald Kaufman: That was her business, not mine. You are what you love, not what loves you. That's what I decided a long time ago.

Ultimately, I get to choose the object of my desire. Even if that person despises me, I can still choose to love them. Donald Kaufman was not in the wrong to think about, love, and masturbate to his fantasy girl.

Also, how are you going to monitor what people think at any given time? It honestly sounds like a movie where people are so controlled that they can't even have a thought without being punished. 

You are essentially asking people to get permission to think. Thousands of thoughts go through peoples heads unchecked every day and no one is the wiser. I glanced at a woman this morning and noticed her boobs, they looked very nice, I thought about them for a while. Should I have told her? No, because there isn't a point, it would have just made her uncomfortable and then it can be constituted as harassment.

This perspective offers a more nuanced and empathetic view towards the act of fantasizing and masturbating about someone without their consent.

On the other hand, Reply B takes a more extreme approach by comparing sexual fantasies to physical assault and suggesting that even thoughts about harming someone could be considered a crime. This argument may come across as too extreme and unrealistic, potentially turning off the original poster from considering the viewpoint presented.

Overall, Reply A provides a more relatable and empathetic perspective on the issue, making it more likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially change their view."
predict-explain,"Whenever I want to know more about an idea, product, etc. I look to someone who has that idea or uses that product to learn more about it. Why, then, is it looked down on and dismissed as anecdotal evidence for someone to share an experience of theirs? I quite enjoy listening to anecdotal evidence to get new perspectives I wouldn't have thought of or haven't heard before.

I understand that in an anecdotal case it is not scientific because it cannot be replicated and held to control standards, but I don't think this is grounds for dismissing the case as merely anecdotal and not worth mentioning. Am I wrong about this?

Anecdotal advice is the reason Amazon values its reviews so highly. People do find a lot of value in reading another person's experience. I'm one of them: I bought the watch that I'm currently wearing after reading over a dozen user reviews on Amazon. 

However, unlike with scientific evidence, you should be much more skeptical about relying on anecdotes. There are plenty of fake reviews on Amazon. In fact, there are so any that Amazon has [had to take action](http://www.geekwire.com/2015/amazon-files-first-ever-suit-over-fake-reviews-alleging-calif-man-sold-fraudulent-praise-for-products/). So proceed with caution and try to get a LOT of feedback so that you aren't influenced by false or misleading reviews.","Essentially, anecdotal evidence is too little evidence. Think of reality as a connect the dots drawing. Each item of anecdotal evidence is a dot. Now then, with say two or three dots, can you tell that the picture will be a car? Of course not. The person supplying that data point could have just been extremely unlucky or extremely lucky. However, when you have say 500 dots, then you can clearly see that the picture will be a Ferrari.  This collection of anecdotes collectively is empirical data. you can perform statistical analysis on it to find am average trend. Rather than seeing just a point, you now have a view of the entire bell curve. If someone was unusually unlucky, you will be able to tell and know that in reality, it's a solid product. Likewise, if someone has been unusually lucky, you can also tell and know that you will most likely get a bad product.",A,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B uses a clear analogy of connecting the dots to explain why anecdotal evidence on its own is not enough to draw conclusions. By comparing anecdotal evidence to individual dots and empirical data to a complete picture, Reply B effectively conveys the importance of looking at a larger sample size to see the full picture and identify trends. This explanation is logical and easy to understand, making it more likely to change the original poster's view on the value of anecdotal evidence."
predict-explain,"First Let me just say I am 16 and don't have much experience with how it is in the 'adult world'. But I don't think a 100% platonic relationship can exist between a straight male and a straight female. 

Can you think back to any friendship and say with absolute certainty that there was never even a hint of attraction? And even if you can, how do you know they don't or never haven't felt that way?

It doesn't even need to be acted on to affect the relationship. It often with subconsciously. From my personal experience, this sort of friendship doesn't exist. 

So, change my view, Reddit!","I strongly disagree, based on the fact that I have several female friends with whom I have nothing more than a friendly relationship.  In most cases, we're both married.  Are some of them attractive?  Sure, but that doesn't mean that the friendship is somehow altered because of that.  And plenty of them I absolutely don't find attractive, and wouldn't be attracted to them even if I were single, yet I'm still friends with them for the same reason I'm friends with guys.  I just enjoy talking to them and doing fun stuff with them.","This sort of logic seems a bit backwards to me.  To me, a relationship is not possible without the people being friends first.  To say the possibility of a relationship precludes a true friendship doesn't make any sense to me, because there is no possibility of a relationship without the friendship.

To think about it from a different perspective, do you think that bi people are incapable of having a friendship?",B,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides personal examples of having platonic relationships with females, even when they are attractive, and emphasizes that attraction does not necessarily affect the friendship. The user also mentions being friends with females they do not find attractive, showing that friendship is based on more than just physical attraction. This personal experience and reasoning may help the original poster see that platonic relationships between straight males and females are indeed possible."
predict-explain,"Having one Bernie Sanders as President is one thing but I don't think it'll result in anything even close to what his supporters would hope. 

Let's cut the cynicism for a moment and let's say that Bernie Sanders is one hundred percent dedicated and accomplishing each and every one of his goals laid out in his agenda. 

Given that the right hates this guy and the amount of corporate influence amongst the Senate (and it's not just limited to the right, I realize), I don't think it's worth being invested in who becomes President so long as the GOP remains as influential as they are in Congress. 

We don't need one Bernie. We need 100 Bernies.

Of course, I would argue that makes him WORSE: because the stuff he's arguing for that his supporters are actually championing for and which may be good won't get passed, but the stuff where he is absolutely nuts will. In short, with a Sanders president, you'll just be getting the terrible things he advocates with him.

So, a CMV response....in a manner of speaking.","First, to quibble:

&gt;We need 100 Bernies.

60 Bernies would be sufficient to be filibuster-proof.

Now, for serious discussion.  Saying he ""cant follow up on any"" is a bit of an overstatement.  Can he do everything he'd like to do the way he'd like to?  No.  But can he make moves in the right direction?  Sure.

Let's look at his Agenda:

*  1. Rebuilding Our Crumbling Infrastructure

Now, this is something that he'd absolutely need Congressional help with.  But it's not hard to sell as pro-business and pro-jobs.  Americans like highways.

* 2. Reversing Climate Change

There is a lot he can do with EPA regulations.  And, again, he sells it as ""Transforming our energy system will not only protect the environment, it will create good paying jobs.""

* 3. Creating Worker Co-ops

Frankly, I'm not sure what, legally would be required for this - whether the department of labor alone can get this done, or he'd need help from Congress.

* 4. Growing the Trade Union Movement

Again, this is somewhat of a mixed bag, but probably more Congress than DoL.  It's also something that I think has some limitations at the Federal level, since a lot of it is governed at the state.

* 5. Raising the Minimum Wage

Definitely needs Congress.

* 6. Pay Equity for Women Workers

I believe that there are already laws on the books that he could choose to enforce more vigorously.  But I'm also not sure what he thinks the goverment should do about this.

* 7. Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers

Now, this is something that the president can absolutely have a huge impact on.

* 8. Making College Affordable for All

Obama has made some strides here.  I don't know how much more he can do without Congress.

* 9. Taking on Wall Street

Again, there's a lot more stringent enforcement of laws, investigations into trading, etc that the executive branch can do, but they certainly can't ""break up the banks"" without Congress.

* 10. Health Care as a Right for All

Yeah, single-payer for everyone can't happen without Congress.

* 11. Protecting the Most Vulnerable Americans

Another one where he can't expand social programs without Congress.

* 12. Real Tax Reform
Again, Congress needs to amend tax law.  Even enforcing through the IRS is restricted by Congressional law.

So, after all of this, I think you're view that ""He can't follow up on any of his points"" is an overstatement, but, yeah, what he can do will be limited with a hostile Congress.",B,A,"I would say reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a detailed breakdown of Bernie Sanders' agenda and highlights the areas where he can take action even without full Congressional support. By showing that there are aspects of Sanders' agenda that can be implemented by the executive branch alone, reply B offers a more nuanced perspective on the potential impact of a Sanders presidency. Additionally, reply B acknowledges the limitations of a hostile Congress, which adds credibility to the argument. Overall, reply B presents a more balanced and informative response that is likely to challenge the original poster's initial skepticism."

I have plenty of short friends who make piss poor money (most of them are school teachers) who still found love. Hell, I have short, fat friends who don't make much to any money who didn't start dating until much later in life who still found someone they fell in love with and happily married.

The only thing that would guarantee you to stay alone is if you continue with the attitude that you're somehow meant to be alone.  Be happy, enjoy life, and take some ladies out.","&gt;I do not think a girl has expressed even the slightest interest in me.

A bit of a personal question here, but do you talk to girls? Do you have female friends or at least female acquaintances? You know, females you're familiar and friendly with? Because if not, I hate to break it to you, but real life isn't like movies. A girl won't spot you walking by and sigh in disbelieve or fall in love with you or anything like that.

To get the interest of a girl, you're going to actually have to talk to her. You're gonna have to talk to a lot of girls. Don't make getting a girlfriend your only reason to talk to a girl. Instead, talk to girls the way you talk to guys, and look for friendships with girls (I started doing this and personally, I found myself much more comfortable with female friends than male friends). This builds social connections, builds up your own experience, increases the chances of getting a girlfriend, etc... You just have to talk, that's about it. Many guys think they don't have girlfriends because they're fat or ugly or things like that, but girls aren't as superficial as guys, believe it or not. Us, guys, like to look at how the girl looks. Of course personality is important, but physical attraction is the more important factor for us. With girls, it's the other way around. They care about how guys look, but not as much as guys care about how girls look. To them, personality is much, much, MUCH more important than looks.",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides examples of people who found love later in life, including short individuals, which shows that it is possible for the original poster to find love as well. It also emphasizes the importance of attitude and mindset in attracting a partner. On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on practical steps the original poster can take, such as talking to girls and building friendships, which are important but may not address the underlying belief of loneliness. Overall, Reply A's message of hope and positivity may be more effective in changing the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"To me, a human's well-being and enjoyment always trump an animal's. It's why we can morally justify continuing to eat meat despite rampant abuse of animals and despite no specific human need to continue to eat meat in much of the western world. This is the same thing; most of the time, we aren't hunting because we need to, we're hunting because we want to. 

What this selective outrage over Cecil tells me is that we, as a society, simply don't have any unified logic towards how we are supposed to treat animals and instead attach our moral views of animal treatment to whatever our culture finds fashionable. Walter James Palmer is potentially going to face criminal charges while Tyson and Perdue make an industry out of their treatment of animals. There is little difference. 

Edit: My opinion on this has been changed. Cecil's existence as a national treasure to Zimbabwe is enough to justify selective outrage. Moreover, Cecil's death specifically highlights issues inherent in illegal poaching.

predict-explain,"This is not meant to be a troll post, but an earnest attempt to determine if my views are incorrect or unfair.  I have two minds when it comes to the fact that so many people have trouble finding a job that pays a living wage and is something they enjoy.  On one hand I am very sympathetic and feel that I have been lucky in life to get to where I am.  On the other hand I got to where I am through taking calculated risks and then stacking the deck in my favor.  There was definitely luck involved, but not all the risks I took paid out and I had to move on to something else.  I feel like too many people aren't taking matters into their own hands regarding their own success, like I feel I did, and I simultaneously feel proud and callous in that belief.  I am unsure which one is more correct.

Example #1

I have been on the recruiting side of multiple companies (tech sector) and have been blown away by the low quality/behavior of applicants.  These are the people that get through the resume filter and are invited on site.  Now I never test applicants on specific details of systems, because in practice you look those up as needed on the job.  I asked about what they have done in the past or what parts of their training they were most familiar with and tested their understanding of it.  I have had people that came into interviews and tried to act like they were running the show, people who refused to answer questions I asked, and people not familiar with the most basic parts of what they said they were experts in.  I know this is anecdotal, but the fact that it was so difficult to find people that were remotely qualified in fields they had spent years studying completely confused me.  The bar for applicants was not high in most cases my team was very motivated to find someone to hire.  I could not understand why people seemed to put in so little effort to sell themselves.
 
Example #2

I once worked for many years at a company that was funded off of venture capital around '08, where all investors closed up shop.  There was a lot of pressure on the company and there were multiple mass layoffs that cut staff to the bone and then even further.  I survived all of them, and eventually resigned because I correctly predicted the company would fold in a month.  I was fully aware of the risk of me losing my job and I countered that by simply being very useful.  This was a win-win scenario, because I was an enthusiastic employee and was happy to improve my skills through working on any existing part of the system or try to develop new ones.  Because of this I was more valuable than most of the other employees and had a ton of work/learning experiences I could talk about with recruiters.  Anyone on the team that was remotely difficult to deal with got cut, and I saw their downfall much earlier than it happened.  Now if everyone is being the star employee it would be a different but I have never found a group where that is the case.  For any individual on a team, you don't have to work more hours than someone else to be more valuable than them; you just need to be more friendly, cooperative, and effective.  In my experience that just requires effort and not any special creativity.

Example #3

I started off with a lot of bad habits that inhibited my professional development.  I am very stubborn, so I tend to go down the wrong path for quite a while before I accept that it is wrong.  Despite that, I always honestly evaluated why other people were more effective employees/professionals than me.  In those cases, I would take a step back, forget my ego, and ask myself what they were doing that I was not.  I'd talk to close friends about this to analyze my conclusions and when I figured out what they were doing better I would work incorporate that into myself.  It seemed much easier to mimic the habits of successful people rather than come up with the behaviors on my own.  The fact that I don't see a lot of people doing this completely baffles me.

My experience has been limited to the tech sector but I don't see why this wouldn't generalize to other fields.  Now there are certainly fields where the supply of people overtakes the demand, but I were in that position I would give it my best shot and if it didn't work out I'd move on to something else.  Please tell me if I'm wrong.

edit: from a lot of the comments, I would like to clarify that I did not mean immediate success.  Rather, that one can be driven and follow a path that eventually does not pan out, but that being drive will eventually lead one to success.

Blaming people for not getting jobs that don't exist is like blaming people for not finding seats in a game of musical chairs.","&gt;My experience has been limited to the tech sector 

This is why. Most people who are complaining about failing to find jobs go for things they love, yet struggle to find jobs for it. 

So, for example, Philosophy has a 9.3% unemployment rate, while Chemical Engineering has a 2.2% unemployment rate [(source)](http://www.studentsreview.com/unemployment_by_major.php3?sort=Rate).

Unfortunately, what someone *wants* to do and what is economically useful doesn't always line up. There are more philosophy majors than there are jobs for philosophy. Most businesses aren't too excited about hiring philosophy majors. Yet, for more tech-oriented fields, the demand has never been higher. And when we look as a whole, rather than just at one field, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that *48% of college grads are in jobs that don't use their degree!* [(source)](http://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2013/05/28/half-of-college-grads-are-working-jobs-that-dont-require-a-degree/)

The iPad offers, among other things:

* A great screen. IPS &gt; AMOLED for color accuracy and the resolution is plenty high.

* Compatibility with other Apple products. Ecosystem cohesion is important to a lot of people.

* Graphics capability that is only rivaled by the few Android tablets with Nvidia's new SoCs (as far as I know).

* Great build quality. Samsung especially falters here, and Samsung tablets are among the most popular Android ones.","Let me give you an analogy: if you were a gamer in the ‘90s, you surely remember all the third party accessories for the Playstation and the Nintendo 64. Mad Catz controllers. Performance memory cards. (Every generation of game consoles has this stuff but this particular gen stands out in my mind for it.)

On paper, these third party accessories were great. A Mad Catz Playstation controller was pretty much identical to a first-party Sony controller. Mad Catz controllers were cheaper too. But they were poorly made. They regularly fell apart or just stopped working. To get that lower price point, corners had to be cut.

I don’t know enough about controller design to say *why* Sony’s Playstation controllers were better. All I know is Sony controllers didn’t break in 6 months.

The situation is similar with Apple products. I can’t tell you *why* exactly an iPad is better than a $350 Android tablet that has all the same features and does all the same stuff. But I can tell you the build quality is superior and it will likely hold up better over time. I can tell you it just feels better to use (some of this gets into iOS-Android comparisons).",B,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a tangible analogy that the original poster can relate to, making it easier to understand the concept of build quality and longevity. The comparison to third-party accessories for gaming consoles helps illustrate the idea that while on paper, a cheaper alternative may seem just as good, the build quality and overall user experience of the more expensive option may be superior in the long run. 

Additionally, reply B acknowledges that they may not know exactly why an iPad is better than a cheaper Android tablet with similar features, but focuses on the overall user experience and build quality. This approach is more relatable and practical for the original poster, as it addresses concerns about justifying the higher price tag for an iPad. 

Overall, reply B's use of a relatable analogy and emphasis on build quality and user experience make it more likely to change the original poster's view."

Since that would really be counter to the fundamentals of the scientific method, it doesn't seem likely.

The only approach I can think of to change your view is to examine what you mean by ""scientists"".  While the overall scientific community would respond as you say, undoubtedly there are many scientists who wouldn't - either because they lack the mental flexibility to rethink their world, or they have a vested interest in the status quo.  Now, I think this would be a small percentage overall, but certainly not ALL scientists would behave ""correctly"".","Scientists, as far as I know, have to assume uniformity or all the scientific theories fail. The thing is though, none have failed for that reason, so they really have evidence by now.

But if the universe would change in how it behaves, they would change their view. An assumption can be challenged and changed clearly.",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A addresses the original poster's point directly by acknowledging the possibility that not all scientists may respond as expected due to various reasons such as lack of mental flexibility or vested interests. By considering this nuance in the behavior of scientists, Reply A provides a more nuanced and realistic perspective on how scientists may react to evidence that challenges the uniformity of nature hypothesis. Reply B, on the other hand, simply reiterates the importance of assuming uniformity without directly addressing the original poster's concerns about how scientists would respond to evidence that contradicts this assumption."
predict-explain,"I think you probably shouldn't own a dog - except maybe you are blind, an old-school shepherd or train them for finding people after avalanches or earthquakes. I have several reasons to holdthis view - here they are, sorted by relevance (from least to most relevant). 

* They eat poo.
* They are annoying. Many people have really strong opinions against smoking in public, because it is upsetting them and accordingly laws have been past in many countries that limit/prohibit smoking in public transport, public buildings, etc. However, it is not uncommon to be leg-humped by a dog in the bus, or step into dog-poo in the park, which I find really annoying. This seems to be regarded as unproblematic, some pepole even get annoyed if you do not want to touch their animal companion with questionable hygiene standards.* You may say that (contrary to smoking) these are merely inconveniences, but in fact...
* ...Some dogs are plain dangerous. Have a look at the [""Fatal dog attacks""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States) wiki entry. Granted, there are MUCH more people dying from cars, cigaretts, cancer (and that's only deadly stuff with a C), etc. but in my opinion even one person would be too much. There are a lot of young children on the list as well. 
* My rant so far may have given you the opinion that I just hate animals. However, the opposite is true - I love them! Therefore I think we shouldn't keep them for our amusement or because we fancy a walk once or twice a day. 
* They eat. In a world where people are starving this is in my opinion morally not justifiable. 
* Most importantly: They produce greenhouse gases - and quite a lot of them! [The co2-""paw print"" of a big dog that gets fed mostly meat may even be bigger than the emissions caused by an SUV.](http://www.salon.com/2014/11/20/the_surprisingly_large_carbon_paw_print_of_your_beloved_pet_partner/)

Therefore I am convinced that you probably shouldn't own a dog. I will not be convinced by single examples where a dog was useful, but by reasons why the overall benefits of private dog-owenership surpass the negetive effects I have listed above. Please CMV!

(*)The fanatic dog-loving may be an issue particular to Germany.



**EDIT: Deltas have been awarded to the argument that dogs ""sage lives"" by providing companionship, and helping with mental as well as physical health issues. It may therefore be argued that these safed lives make up for the harm that dogs cause elsewhere. Thanks to /u/stoopydumbut, /u/RustyRook, and /u/jiw123. (Others have also made the same point later). Thanks for the interesting discussion. At the very least I learned that I am pretty alone in my distaste for dog poo :)**

**EDIT 2: Ok, it's 3am where I am and I think all arguments that can be made about the issue have been made. Good night and thanks again for the discussion!**

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","Dogs are AWESOME. A few benefits: 

* Having dogs makes the owner significantly more likely to be sufficiently [physically active](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2156050/). From the study: ""odds of achieving sufficient physical activity and walking were 57% to 77% higher among dog owners compared with those not owning dogs..."" This is backed up [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379705003995) and [here](http://journals.humankinetics.com/AcuCustom/Sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/17134.pdf) and in many, many other studies.

* Dogs are extremely helpful in reducing the healthcare costs of the elderly. [Proof](http://jah.sagepub.com/content/20/4/437.short): ""Interaction between humans and dogs is a mechanism that can enhance the physical and psychological health of elderly citizens and promote a social support network between dog owners. In turn, dependence and impact on health and social services are alleviated.""

* Owning pets is extremely beneficial for [one's psychological health](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-13783-001/). From the study: ""owners enjoyed better well-being when their pets fulfilled social needs better, and the support that pets provided complemented rather than competed with human sources.""

There are more benefits, like the fact that pets make owners laugh a lot, etc. But I'd like to talk about a few things you've brought up:

&gt; They are annoying.

Well-trained dogs aren't annoying at all. In fact, dogs are highly intelligent and respond very well to training. Some owners are worse than others is all. Responsible owners know the benefits of training their dogs.

&gt; They eat. In a world where people are starving this is in my opinion morally not justifiable.

You're assuming that all the resources that are used to produce dog food would be magically transferred to alleviating global hunger - that's unlikely to happen. 

So, what do you think?

Edit: fixed link","I'll hit your relevant ones first:

&gt; They produce greenhouse gases - and quite a lot of them!

That article it basing a lot of that greenhouse gas emission off of a primarily meat based diet...which a lot of dogs don't usually have.  Most people I know primarily feed their dogs non-meat based food.  Take [Purina](http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/purina-pro-plan-dog-food-selects-dry/) for example, it's mostly fish product (less greenhouse producing compared to land based meats) and grains.  A lot of the meats that also go into dog food are byproducts of human meat consumption as well...so it's not like there are farms of animals specifically for dog food.

IMO, this article is pretty weaksauce.

&gt; They eat. In a world where people are starving this is in my opinion morally not justifiable. 

It's logistics.  People are going to starve regardless if you have pets or kids or if you live high on the hog eating steaks every night.  Having a pet is irrelevant to other people starving.  The food and resources going into a dog probably won't ever make it to these people unless you actively choose to spend your time and money diverting resources to starving people rather than have a pet.

&gt; Therefore I think we shouldn't keep them for our amusement or because we fancy a walk once or twice a day.

It's companionship more than entertainment.  If you're a good pet owner this is a mutually beneficial life for both parties.  

&gt; Some dogs are plain dangerous

Not any more dangerous than people, or other wild animals.  And a well trained dog with a proper owner wouldn't have issues like this.

&gt; They are annoying

See above.  A well trained dog with a proper owner doesn't have issues with barking or bothering people.  Proper owners also clean up after their pets.

&gt; They eat poo

Only if you let them.  A baby would eat poo too if it got hold of some and you weren't paying attention.

TL;DR.  It seems like a lot of these issues are a symptom of poor training and irresponsible owners.  You should be against careless owners rather than saying a blanket statement of ""no one should own dogs"".",A,A,"I would say that reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides scientific evidence and studies to support the benefits of owning dogs, such as increased physical activity, reduced healthcare costs for the elderly, and improved psychological health. It also addresses the concerns raised by the original poster, such as annoyance and environmental impact, by highlighting the importance of responsible ownership and the potential limitations of transferring resources to alleviate global hunger.

Reply B, on the other hand, focuses more on rebutting the specific points made by the original poster without providing as much evidence or support for the benefits of dog ownership. While it does address the concerns raised, it may not be as persuasive in changing the original poster's view due to the lack of concrete evidence and scientific support."
predict-explain,"I recently saw a video on why the Republicans [can't win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFrsmi-wazI) the 2016 election. If we go by raw numbers, Hillary will most likely win the next election. This got me thinking.

Demographics are changing in America. Firstly, Non-whites become a higher percent of the US population seemingly every year. This could be for a number of reasons, like immigration, but it's a good thing for the democrats because non-whites are statistically more likely to be liberal. I don't see this trend changing so I have a hard time seeing how the a Conservative will be voted into office again. 

Secondly, Conservatives are aging. Statistically, older people are typically more conservative whereas younger people are typically more liberal. The older Conservatives will eventually all die and be replaced by young liberals. 

I must be overlooking something, or missing some way that Conservatives can get votes in the future. Has a situation like this happened before? 

edit: view is changed","The flaw in your thinking is that people don't change their beliefs over time.  You know all of those ""old Conservatives"" that are starting to die off?  They were bra-burning, free-loving, pot-smoking hippies in the 1960s.  They were ""young liberals.""  

It isn't that conservatism was popular in 50 years ago and now it's been replaced with liberalism.  It's that people tend to be liberal when they're young and *become* more conservative over time.  

Also, please don't confuse Conservative with Republican.  These are very different things.","Public opinion can shift, but so can the Republican party.  If Republicans start losing big-time, the platforms of its candidates will shift.

But Republicans *are* winning elections. Republicans hold the House (by a wide margin) and the Senate.  There are way more Republican governors than Democrats. 

Additionally, how people vote in election depends on a lot more than the views the candidates hold.  The overall assessment of how the country is doing, especially its economy, is a huge factor.  If everything is going well, incumbents (and the incumbent party) get a boost.  If not, incumbents (and the incumbent party) are hurt.  You can see this with the House and Senate.  During and shortly after the end of the unpopular Bush presidency, the House and Senate were solidly Democrat.  But as the economy continued to slump under Obama, they've both gone back to solidly Republican.  People's opinions didn't drastically change in that time.  It's more that the overall political climate shifted.",A,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more detailed and nuanced explanation of the current political landscape, pointing out that Republicans are actually winning elections and holding significant power in various levels of government. It also highlights the role of economic factors and overall political climate in influencing election outcomes, which adds complexity to the original poster's assumption that demographics alone will determine future election results.

On the other hand, while Reply A makes a valid point about people's beliefs evolving over time, it doesn't directly address the original poster's concerns about the future of conservatism in American politics.

Overall, Reply B offers a more comprehensive and convincing argument that challenges the original poster's viewpoint and provides a broader perspective on the issue."
predict-explain,"I believe that it is bad for humans generally that we have patriotism. It leads not only to discrimination. (hello Mr Trump)
But also to economic and political difficulties and misstrust.

It prevents not only people from accepting everyone as their partner in human, but also causes hatred and sometimes war between nations or ethnic groups.

I dont mean that partriotism is worse than no patriotism, but that as a concept and as an element we experience all the time it it in itself bad for us.

(Intrinsic badness versus comparative badness) 

Without patriotism we could form one great community and society. This is prevented by prejudice against others and arrogance about themselves, partiotism conveys.

Fear and prejudice are not the products of patriotism, they're a fact of being human. Our minds are not and never will be unbiased, but patriotism helps.

Patriotism is what lets us accept anyone as our partner in being human, in my opinion. Patriotism is what lets us say that we like the other Americans, the other Germans, etc--society without patriotism is not one great society, but no society, because without some belief in the groups that we are a part of, why would we be a member of them?

Therefore, Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"My proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in the wild is ""xe/xer/xerself"" or ""zi/zis/zimself"". My argument is as follows:

1. Pronouns are always dealing with a spectrum. A ""he"" can be used to describe both masculine as well as feminine men and similarly for she and women. The singular they is also covering a spectrum, the spectrum of all people that do not identify with either gender or those that identify with both to differing degrees. Therefore they is sufficient to describe alternative gender identities.
2. If we'd decide that new pronouns are necessary to describe or be inclusive to specific non-standard gender identities, we would very likely end up with a sheer infinite amount of pronouns. Since the argument for further pronouns would not be based on scientific facts but rather on feelings of individual people, the argument why some new pronouns are okay and others aren't would be a very difficult one to make. The result would be that we would have to allow anyone to pick or create their own pronouns.
3. Since we'd have a large number of new pronouns people would very likely get confused, since they'd not only have to remember a name and a face but also the specific pronouns of a person AND incorporate those into everyday speech. The result would either be that people would start inadvertently giving offence or our speech patterns would change to rely far more on using names instead of pronouns. 
4. Having a wide range of new pronouns would actively harm the English language by making it less clear. Encountering unknown pronouns would confuse people and make it difficult to imagine what kind of character is being talked about.

If someone is doing my car repair, why am I forced to include information about their genitals every time I talk about them? The words he/she are forcing me to both know and share data about a person's gender when I have no interest in doing so.

Under the current system, the singular ""they"" can refer to male, female, and other identities, which is about as unclear as things can get.

Reply A provides a practical example of how using gender-neutral pronouns can be beneficial in everyday situations, such as when referring to someone whose gender is unknown or irrelevant. It highlights the unnecessary emphasis on gender that traditional pronouns can impose in certain contexts. This argument appeals to the original poster's concern about the potential confusion and harm that new pronouns may cause, by showing how a gender-neutral pronoun can actually simplify communication without the need for a wide range of new pronouns.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the clarity of using new pronouns, but does not directly address the original poster's concerns about confusion and harm to the English language. While it does make a valid point about the additional information that new pronouns can provide about a person's identity, it does not fully counter the original poster's argument about the practicality and potential drawbacks of introducing a large number of new pronouns."
predict-explain,"Just as the title says, I firmly believe that the modern interpretation of the hipster does not truly exist and never has. I'm going to link an article from two years ago, and I'd appreciate it if you'd read it, [thanks!](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/opinion/sunday/caught-in-the-hipster-trap.html?_r=1)
If you've read that, you'll see all the contradictory things that make a hipster look like a hipster. Hipsters like old heritage looks, but they also like all contemporary clothing. Their footwear of choice are trainers, skate shoes, loafers, wingtips, sandals, and all manner of boots. Seems the only shoe that's off the list is a pair of stark black oxfords, but even then, I don't know. Hipsters like Apple products, but also love old technology! Their hobbies are anything outdoorsy or creative, except when they aren't I.E video games. They embrace both irony and sincerity ect., ect.,ect. It just seems like a strawman built up to shun anyone doing anything or acting in a certain way that you don't like. It also seems to be that the thing everyone hates about hipsters is their attitude, but deep down, it's an attitude anyone can have. It's an attitude of snobbishness and inauthenticity. I've mentioned this to a lot of people, I'd like to hear what others have to say, try changing my view!

The gist of it is this: a number of people all wish to subvert norms in the same way counter cultures always have. They end up settling into the same fashion choices because they all have the same information about what mainstream culture is and understandably make similar choices as a result.

Reply B provides a more in-depth explanation of hipster culture and the reasons behind their fashion choices and behaviors. It suggests that hipsters are individuals who are trying to subvert norms and end up making similar choices due to their shared knowledge of mainstream culture.

Additionally, the mention of visiting Williamsburg in Brooklyn to see stereotypes of hipsters in action provides a real-world example that could potentially challenge the original poster's beliefs."
predict-explain,"I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small town/village, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too many to list, but the big ones are:

#Cities have significantly better municipal services.

The difference is night and day. Cities have bigger and better libraries, schools, police/fire departments, hospitals, gas, internet, and so on and so forth. As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first. Everything about this makes city life so much safer and more comfortable.

#Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.

A really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops. Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties. There are theatres and large public events and strip clubs and meetings of like-minded people and clubs and just about anything to do if you ever get bored. There's a convenience store on just about every corner.

#Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity.

If you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a **new neighbor** that they wanna get to know and everything. Even if you abstain from social interaction, you become ""that weird neighbor that abstains from social interaction."" This  tends to temper individualism, and it's not like you can ""just spend time with the people you like,"" because rumors and all travel fast with a community that small.

#bugs

holy fucking shit the bugs aaaaaaaaa

#In the country, everything is high maintenance.

Since just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.","&gt;Cities have significantly better municipal services.

While this is true, the people who live in the country don't value these things the same way as people who live in the city. They don't care about 4G LTE, and likely don't even have a phone to utilize it. They may not like it that the city is bigger (this isn't inherently a better thing), and while you mentioned that cities are safer, I'm not so sure thats a true statement. I think crime is much more common within the city than in rural areas. Plus, people in rural areas are likely confident in their abilities to defend themselves and their families in dangerous situations, and don't necessarily want to have to depend on the municipalities for that. 

Basically, if you are used to living in the city, then you place value on all the things you listed about municipal services. If you live out in the country, you're used to getting by without them and they don't necessarily have the same value.

&gt;Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.

Again, this is something that some people may actually see as a downside to the city. People used to living in a rural area might not like the hustle and bustle of the city, and enjoy spending recreational time doing things out in nature. People may not like malls, and they may not actually meet any like-minded people within the city.

&gt;Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity

This isn't something that everybody values. Some people enjoy daily interactions with the same people, and enjoy being in a community where they are recognized and have long standing histories with people. 

&gt;bugs

Maybe people in the country are indifferent to bugs? I don't know

&gt;In the country, everything is high maintenance

I'm fairly sure its cheaper to live in rural areas than it is to live in the city. Even if it is true that more maintenance is required, people typically do their own maintenance and perhaps don't mind it.

TL;DR People who were born in rural areas have a completely different set of values than someone born in a city. All of the things you listed as upsides to living in the city, they may see as downsides, and vice versa. Your world view is shaped by your experiences, so if your experience is living in the country, then your world view is vastly different than someone who has experienced nothing but city life.","I think there's a trade off for everything. You're accustomed to having everything as fast as you want it. Country people aren't. They know and accept some things are going to be a hike.

It's also possible you don't really ""hear"" the noise around you all the time like someone who hasn't grown up with it or lived in it for many years, would. Silence is golden, and if you live in an area where you can never have that, it can drive some people mad. 

It's difficult to say one is ""better"" than the other. I'd vouch both have their bonuses. 

The quiet, the privacy the country affords, the beauty of it. Enjoying nature, having a big garden, maybe even some farm animals. You can't do those things in the city and those things sure can keep people, very busy. 

The bugs one though, come on. You know as well I do there are many cities with very nasty bug problems.",A,A,"I would say reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a different perspective on the benefits of living in the country and highlights how the values and experiences of individuals shape their preferences for city or country living. It also challenges the original poster's assumptions about what is important to people living in rural areas. Reply A offers a nuanced and thoughtful response that encourages the original poster to consider different viewpoints, which could potentially lead to a shift in their perspective."
predict-explain,"For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. 

This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due my exposure to the idea on reddit/other internet sources, and partly because I've never been in an environment where sexual encounters are frequent. I don't think I'm of the party that has difficulty understanding consent. I also understand that there may be a great deal of fear for some women that they may be raped, and I don't wish to sound as though I'm downplaying that. But I have a fear myself of being falsely accused, or accused in a case where consent is retroactively removed. I don't think of this potential as being very high; I don't think most women are that vindictive; however in the event that it occurs it seems the results can be devastating. I've personally spoken to someone who has gone through this process and it took him almost a year to clear his name. 

I don't want this fear; I'm very open to the idea that it may be exaggerated in the media I've read, or that there are faults in my reasoning. But these are potentials and I can't seem to confirm them on my own; maybe someone else can poke some holes.

I wouldn't say so much, don't have sex at all, but being cautious in who you choose to have intercourse with (and under what circumstances) seems wise.

So, you have two questions, ""Does this girl really want to fuck?"" and ""Is this girl a vindictive bitch who will screw me over even if she really wanted it?""

In the second case, you wouldn't just be on the lookout for false-rape accusers, but someone who would total your car without even asking if they could borrow it, steal your wallet, pop over at your parents' house in the middle of the night, and all manner of bat-shit crazy activity that you would want to avoid. Might want to take a page out of ""How to avoid serial killers on craigslist"" for tips on dealing with that scenario.

In the first case, well, simply go slower with a woman than you might like to otherwise until you feel comfortable that you are both on the same page as to what you want to do with each other. There's nothing wrong with saying, ""I don't kiss on the first date."" At your age there's gonna be a lot of virgins around - heck, some of 'em are gonna think it's a huge deal having their boobs fondled for the first time, might be an event all on it's own. Going slow is good, it lets 'em ease into the idea.

When you get more experienced you'll get better at reading signals and discussing such things, and with a woman who's into it you might not need to hold off as long before feeling comfortable partaking as when you first started with your sexual explorations.

Tl;dr: If you're worried, try dating the same woman for a while first and see what she likes before starting a spree of one-night-stands.","You should refrain from sexual activity with your spouse because of false rape allegations?

predict-explain,"To get this out of the way early: **This is not going to be a PCMR circlejerk.** An unnecessary reminder: this subreddit is for reasoned persuasion, not mutual masturbation. 

I'm talking strictly about advantages **in professional, competitive, skill-based, PvP shooters** given by playing at a lower resolution, taller aspect ratio (4:3 vs 16:9), or narrower FOV (excepting personal tolerance for distortion). 

[This is the photo that prompted my question.](http://i.imgur.com/9Lo87yI.jpg) There is absolutely NO WAY that playing at 1024x768 (and unless that's a 1440p monitor, I think it's reasonable to suspect it's actually 800x600) gives him ANY advantage, and is instead a handicap, but it's not uncommon for professionals to play this way (I'm thinking in particular of the CS:GO / CS:S scene). 

**Points of confusion:**

* With upscaling disabled, the pixels are the same size as they would be if he were playing at native resolution, so there's no 'zoom' offered. 
* Lower resolution means, definitively, less rendering precision. If an enemy's head is visible over an edge at distance, it may not take up enough of the player's FOV to be rendered (possibly an unlikely example). Also, the player is less able to aim in small increments. These are non-issues issue at 1080p+ resolutions. 
* UI elements (note especially the map and kill feed in the linked photo) are measured in pixels, and so obscure a HUGE percentage of available vision. This is greatly reduced by having more pixels on the screen.
* Horizontal FOV (at a given level of distortion) suffers because of the narrower 4:3 aspect ratio. Limited peripheral vision is an obvious disadvantage that's very simply fixed with a widescreen 16:9/16:10 aspect ratio. 

**Warrants** (I believe that's the appropriate term) **/ Assumptions:**

^(^Read: ^""These ^arguments ^are ^either ^completely ^ineffective ^""against"" ^me ^or ^irrelevant ^to ^a ^sponsored ^professional."")

* No hardware limitations (GPU inadequacy, etc).
* A competitor wants every advantage available to them, especially the legal/fair ones. 
* A professional recognizes that 'their way' might not be the best way, and would readily change for the sake of improvement.
* Access to more information is always better. 
* Greater precision is always better. 

So, why would anyone play at 800x600 or 1024x768? ""Because they're used to it"" seems to be the most common answer, but I feel like that's nothing but lazy and backwards.

^(Please forgive any formatting mistakes; I'm on mobile. I'll correct them as soon as I get back to a desktop.)","For some folks, it definitely is hardware related. Not that they can't run it at max settings, but lower resolution would remove precious nanoseconds to any action they performed. As well, in your pic for example, the black border may help the player focus better. I have a cluttered desk,  and sometimes the visual 'busyness' of the desk distracts me  when game play action happens near the edge of the screen.","The fovea of your eye is a small part right in the center of your retina and field of vision. You have the clearest vision there, and it slowly deteriorates the farther you get away from there. If you want to have the best vision, you want to concentrate as much important information as possible directly into that spot. A smaller resolution allows for the entire game's field of vision to be in that small part of your eye that sees best.",B,A,"I would say that Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a physiological explanation for why playing at a smaller resolution could actually be beneficial in terms of concentrating important information in the clearest part of the eye's field of vision. This explanation adds a new perspective to the discussion and could potentially make the original poster reconsider their stance on the topic. Reply A, on the other hand, focuses more on personal preferences and distractions, which may not be as convincing in this context."
predict-explain,"I have recently been told that my pro-life position is ""forcing my ideas on others"".  I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary.  This "" forcing ideals on others"" is an argument I hear often and I just want to understand it better. I believe that a fetus is a human being. I confess, that is my view, not everyone's view. I believe an abortion is the murder of that child. This is still my view. Not everyone's. United States law entitles all humans to life. Passing legislation opposing abortion is simply following that idea in my way. I am not forcing anyone to agree with me. I am simply making sure the law is followed as I read it. 

For a hypothetical:

It's 1870 and there is a white who believes that black people are subhuman (not so uncommon at the time). If I say no they are not subhuman. They are human beings and I will prosecute you if you kill them am I "" forcing my ideals on them"" or am I simply protecting what I believe to be human life. And even if I am ""forcing my ideals"" on the man isn't it necessary to do so?  

The abortion debate is a matter of whether the fetus is indeed entitled to the rights of a living human. It has nothing to do with a group forcing it's ideas on another and such statements are only used to unjustly vilify the pro-life movement.","The fetus is, until birth, a parasite. This is true even if we all agree that it is a person. US law entitles all humans to life but it does *not* entitle humans to use other people's bodies without their consent. Forcing them to do so *is* forcing your ideas on others in every sense of the phrase.","You are clearly enforcing a particular reading of the law, though, right? As in: you support using state power to prevent people from acting under a different reading of the law, or against the law entirely.

I don't think the argument 'you're forcing your ideas onto others' is valid at all: all laws are doing that (although they're usually not forcing the *idea*, only the practice). But, in a technical sense, I think it's clear that being pro-life is advocating for 'forcing your ideas onto others', it's just that that's not a bad thing, necessarily.",B,A,"I would say that reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A presents a logical argument based on bodily autonomy and the idea that forcing someone to carry a fetus to term against their will is indeed forcing one's ideas onto others. It addresses the core issue of the debate and provides a clear rationale for why the pro-life stance could be seen as imposing beliefs on others. Reply B, on the other hand, acknowledges that all laws involve forcing ideas onto others but does not directly address the specific issue of bodily autonomy and the right to choose. Therefore, reply A is more likely to challenge the original poster's perspective and prompt them to reconsider their position."
predict-explain,"I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer even use firearms (I mean the guns that can kill, I'm not sure since it's not my native language) if he/she doesn't intend to kill? I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing him/her, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen. Plus, even if the suspect is really guilty, a police officer shouldn't kill him/ her, right? And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?

predict-explain,"It all sound the same to me. And to be clear, I know this is what people tend to say about any music they don't ""get."" People say this about rap -- it's just noise, etc. But I like rap, and I think you can make a pretty good argument that there's a ton of variety in rap. From voice to lyrics to production to rhythm, there's really no reason to say Aesop Rock sounds like Mobb Deep, or a track off Illmatic sounds like a Drake mixtape.

I like a lot of types of popular music but don't like punk/hardcore. I looked up hardcore on wikipedia and it seemed like the songs had to fall within a pretty narrow range of genre conventions: short length, driving bass rhythm, simple chords, heavy distortion, shouted lyrics.

So my question is: what does a punk/hardcore fan listen for? What kind of stuff makes a good punk song if the songs are very similar in key respects, or am I missing the boat and there's a lot of variety out there? 

Anyway, I am not trying to be a hater, I'm just out of the loop on this music and its appeal. Thanks.","how did you learn to tell the difference between rap artists? Did you listen to a handle full of songs once and you were done? Or did you spend a lot of time exploring different tracks from different artists?

That being said, you're in luck, because punk is long dead.","I don't have a good verbal argument for this... but compare Black Flag to The Bad Brains and you'll find tremendous differences.  

I think your rap analogy is pretty solid.   

I friggin love NWA and the Wu Tang but a LOT of people even ones who really like rap think most of the Wu Tang songs are weird and boring experimental nonsense...     they've got over 100 tracks and maybe 20 of them are phenomenal while some of the others leave you scratching your head.  

Mostly for Punk / hardcore you're listening for a hook that grabs you.   

A lot of it is emotional resonance...


My War by Black Flag absolutely falls in the category of Fast, loud, no melody...  but it grabs you and holds you for the whole song if you've ever had a period in your life where you were just pissed off...  

It's actually really similar to gangsta rap...  it's about a feeling... often one of anger or trying to get over on ""the system""",B,A,"I would say Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

The user also draws parallels between punk/hardcore and rap, emphasizing the emotional resonance and the importance of a hook in punk music. This response provides a clear explanation and makes a connection to something the original poster is already familiar with (rap music), which may help them better understand and appreciate punk music."
predict-explain,"I've seen it a dozen times. Someone wants a tattoo and so they look at magazines or websites or celebs or tv shows (Miami Ink and the like) or other people from real life for inspiration.

Every time someone does something like that, I can't help but think less of their tattoo.

Many a times, I've seen a really nice tattoo and it's always a bittersweet feeling. On one hand it's a beautiful piece, on the other, I never want to have a similar one to that, as I'd feel I was just copying the other person.

Whenever I ask a friend why they picked a tattoo from a portfolio, their answer is never far from ""because I think it's cool"", so elaorating beyond that would be best I suppose.

Is this a normal feelling? It seems perfectly normal to look for inspiration on other things, but then again, it makes me feel as if the art isn't as original as it should be.

Thanks!

**EDIT**: Lots of replies on inspiration from random sources. I don't think that's bad, only that inspiration *from other tattoos* (or copying of tattoos) display lack of originality.

It's impossible not to be influenced by environment.

Every person saw 100s maybe 1000s tattoos, no new tattoo will be 100% original, it will be inspired by tattoos that you saw in the past consciously or unconsciously.

It is absolutely possible to cerate a new and original work of art that is inspired by other art.

For example when Hamlet wrote Hamlet he was clearly inspired by Icelandic tales and Scandinavian myth - yet Hamlet is an original work of art.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sources_of_Hamlet","I think originality is really a lie people like to feed themselves. basically of creativity is built and inspired by other creative works, and originality for the sake of originality is often not worth it.


Personally I wouldn't get a tattoo, because almost every year I decide that past me was an idiot, and I wouldn't trust my decision making. That being said, if I was to get a tattoo, it would probably be unoriginal as fuck.

On the other hand, Reply B dismisses the idea of originality as a lie and focuses more on personal preference rather than addressing the issue of originality in art.

predict-explain,"Hi.

Whenever I read about people trying to 

- increase the number of women in science or engineering
- increase the number of women in politics
- increase the number of women in positions of power
- increase the number of women that are firefighters or police

I can't help feeling that it is a rather useless cause. I have no problem at all with there being less women than men in any place. What I would (and do) have a problem with is women having it more difficult than men to enter certain professions. That is the real problem we should, as a society, try to solve.

The current approach is ""forcing"" the proportion of women to increase, by means of: 

- gender-specific student grants, 
- positions reserved for women, 
- lower physical requirements,
- etc.

As I see it this kind of solutions are problematic in two ways:

- They involve so-called ""positive discrimination"", which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman. This is absurd and can increase animosity in the male coworkers. Admittedly, that would be wrong on their part, but it still can create an hostile work environment.

- They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. 

The only benefits I see is that ""artificially"" increasing the number of women in certain places may make the presence of women in said place appear less ""unusual"" to society, thereby decreasing the discrimination, but I still think they do more harm than good.

Reddit, change my view!

PD: English is not my first language, so I apologize for any awkwardly phrased sentence I may have written, and welcome any correction. 

EDIT: In only a few hours there have been a lot of great answers that have confirmed my feeling that this was a more nuanced issue that I could even imagine. My view has been changed in that I had underestimated the benefits of this kind of measures. In particular I now see that:

- Artificially increasing the number of women in certain fields makes said fields much less ""threatening"" to other women.
- Makes male coworkers appreciate the capabilities of women, decreasing further discrimination.
- Improves the selection process by eliminating male-favoring biases. Whenever a man less prepared than a woman would have got the position by conscious or unconscious biases a well-prepared woman will get it.

I remain unconvinced that physical tests should have easier versions for women. Most people seemed to agree with me on this, though. I have realized, however, that jobs that at first seem to be mainly physical (police, firefighters, ...) would also benefit from having more women. 

Some of my favourite answers, where you can find studies supporting all of this, are:

If there is a disparity, we know it's because of a problem somewhere, which may be that ""employers are discriminating against women"" or that ""women don't see a career in this as realistic"" or even that ""girls are taught not to pursue this field."" Not all of these are the employers' fault, and all of them happen to some extent or other (and, to a far lesser degree, to boys and men.) 

&gt;The current approach is ""forcing"" the proportion of women to increase, by means of: - gender-specific student grants, - positions reserved for women, - lower physical requirements, - etc.

There is a reason for these measures, which (you are correct) is not about getting at the heart of the problem of discrimination. While ending discrimination is a difficult, long-term goal that doesn't have an easy solution, ending *the effects of discrimination on women now* is something we *can* try to fix. All these measures are about equalizing the opportunities available between men and women entering the workforce. Note that they are not, in all circumstances, perfect at this. But women in the US, today, do have a right to not experience discrimination, and protecting that right can mean legal action.

Note that your points about ""the animosity of male coworkers"" is comparing to an ideal, discrimination-free society. The fact is that women were *already* discriminated against in the workplace. Before affirmative action, there already *were* stereotypes about ""sleeping her way up the ladder"" where people just assumed that women got the job for being women. The facts of discrimination, in that sense, haven't changed, but there is still better equality of opportunity to get those jobs in the first place.","Boosting the ratio of women to men is not only good for women, it is [good for businesses](http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/better_decisions_through_diversity). Studies have shown that more diverse groups tend to improve businesses, for a number of reasons:

&gt; Cultural diversity positively affects total factor productivity at the plant level.

[source](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166046215000459)

&gt; we found that employee engagement and gender diversity independently predict financial performance at the business-unit level. One implication is that making diversity an organizational priority and creating an engaged culture for the workforce may result in cumulative financial benefits.

[source](http://jlo.sagepub.com/content/21/4/354.short)

&gt; They find a robust significant positive relationship between firm performance and both female manager ratio and gender diversity

[source](http://cluteinstitute.com/ojs/index.php/JDM/article/view/8620)

So while there may be some problems with qualified people loosing out, this is always going to happen - there are not jobs for all the qualified people in the world anyway. 

From a business POV, it is beneficial to ensure diversity. From a social POV, it is beneficial to ensure one gender is not severely underrepresented at decision making levels, and to ensure that young girls can have role models in the same way young boys can.

See the documentary [Miss Representation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1784538/) for some further discussion on this (it's on Netflix).",B,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides concrete evidence and studies that show the benefits of diversity in businesses, which can appeal to the original poster's logical side.

Additionally, reply B also addresses the social perspective and the importance of ensuring gender representation at decision-making levels and providing role models for young girls. This appeal to the societal impact and the importance of representation can resonate with the original poster's sense of fairness and equality.

Overall, reply B provides a well-rounded argument that combines both practical benefits and societal considerations, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"If this is a duplicate post, I apologize, an AutoMod told my my old version was too short and that it was removed.

If I get drunk and crash my car, it's my problem.

If I get drunk and get into a fight, it's my problem.

If I get drunk and have sex, it's my problem.

-----------------------

Of course, though, if you slip something into my drink and have sex with me, that's not my fault, and if you give me a drink and say it's Mountain Dew when it is actually something that knocks me out, it's your fault.

So if it wasn't concious and consentual, then it's still rape.

And if you were given it under a false idea of what you were ingesting, it's arguably still rape. (But if you say, oh sir I didn't know that alcohol makes you make bad decisions it's not rape)

------------------------------

worknman brought up something I didn't think to address, but I meant if someone says ""yes"" and has something in their body that they put in themselves that they knew makes them make bad decision, it's not rape. A drunk person *can* give consent if they consentually got drunk.

So also, if someone attempts to have sex with them and they say ""no"" and are too drunk to fight back, it's still rape, because they didn't give consent.

I'm probably gonna get lynched for asking this, but it's basic courtesy. Please don't downvote everything I say just because you disagree, please. It's very obviously going to happen, but please, just don't.

predict-explain,"I've been trying to figure out where I fall on this, but I don't think it's worth potentially ruining a relationship with another person (a friendly relationship or other) by discussing your political views in person or online.

I live in the South, and recently there have been a lot of stuff going on with the Confederate Flag being taken down everywhere and the recent gay rights ruling by the Supreme Court. I think these are both great things, but the majority of my peers on Facebook/Twitter are aggressively against it gay rights and the fact that the Confederate Flag is now in the spotlight and being frowned upon. A part of me wants to speak my mind about it and tell them how I feel to reason with them a bit, but the other part of me thinks its a bad idea. Being vocal about my views could potentially cut off half of all people from even giving me the chance of meeting them and potentially being friends with them just because of my political views. I know a lot of people I consider friends that have political views that I don't agree with at all, and I don't know if letting everyone know how I feel about these situations is worth ruining that.

I have also heard quotes about how doing/saying nothing is worse than being against it, and that during the civil rights movement most people were silent which was definitely a bad thing, but I'm not sure if it's worth speaking up.

I know exactly who I can talk to about political issues and who not to.

Also, consider that discussion about politics can harbor new thoughts and change people's minds on how they see the world, either for better or for worse. What's wrong with stimulating the mind a little bit? Again, there's nothing wrong with other discussion topics but politics doesn't have to be taboo with everyone.

I would also suggest, don't start talking about your radical stance on the eugenics of the human species by immediately aborting genetically deficient babies with people that you only just recently met (assuming abortion is your topic of choice when discussing politics) because I'm sure the general population doesn't sit well with that idea and/or have never even entertained that idea before.","The short answer: Be selective about who you talk with about controversial topics.

Some of your closer friends are probably already aware that you don't share their political views. So choose the ones among them who you think you could have a conversation with and roll with it. If you're sure you do want to discuss it it's a good idea to lay the groundwork and then talk about it in person.

predict-explain,"""Normal""

(adj.) Conforming to the standard or common type.

---

By the above definition, we can be sure that there is a 'Normal' human being. Or at the very least, various 'Normal' states to make up a 'Normal' human being.

Anything that is in the majority is a 'Normal' state. So, the 'Normal' human being is a Cisgendered, Heterosexual, Chinese man.

This means that states such as Transgender, Homosexual, Autistic etc. are not 'Normal'. They are in fact 'different'. and we desperately need to stop acting as if they are normal. They are different.

This does not mean they are worse, undesirable or negative. Nor does it mean they are better, desirable or positive. They are simply different.

Homosexual people do make up a small but significant percentage of humans, and when people say that it is not normal they do not mean it is not the norm, they mean it is not normative (as in the common and correct way of going about things).



There are combinations of hair and eye colour that are less common then homosexuality, there is never any question of whether or not these are normal, normality only comes up when it is accompanied by a value judgement.



Even if there were no distiction of normal vs normative then you are left having to find a demarcation for what percentage of a population does something have to be for it to be concidered normal or not, and unless you have that clearly defined point and do not move it around to suit your value judgments, then you have no basis for throwing normal or abnormal around.","I would say there's too many variables at play to designate one type of person as normal as then too many people are outliers.

Take, for example, ethnicity. While the largest ethnicity group is Chinese, there are more non-Chinese as a whole, so how can an overall (in the scale of the global population) minority be considered 'normal'?

predict-explain,"Cutthroat Kitchen is a reality TV cooking show where contestants bid on sabotages to make their competitors fail at cooking the dish that needs to be cooked, and keep the money remaining.  Often, this requires picking a competitor who gets sabotaged.  E.g. ""One of your opponents will give up all their ingredients and have to make their tacos using just what they can recover from this day old salad bar.""

This view is about what the best strategy for handing out a sabotage is.  I think that in the first 2 rounds, when you have a choice, you should always target whoever already has a sabotage.  So if someone gave another competitor the salad bar, and then you're handing out who has to give up all utensils for tinfoil, you should always pick the person who got the salad bar.

The reason is this: you do not win a round of CTK.  You just refrain from losing.  Having the best dish is no better than having the second or third best dish in round one.  You are best off by trying to guarantee one person fails totally.  Because then they go home.

Spreading out the sabotages means its less likely that they'll be crippling (since they're tested to be doable).  If you pile them all on one person though, it becomes much more likely they'll totally fail, thus saving you.

First: there's an alternate strategy that says you should always target the person who you think would be your (personal) toughest competitor, leaving the weaker opponents to survive. Sometimes this may override the advantage that dogpiling provides. 

That said... it really depends on what the sabotages are. I don't think there can really be any one perfect strategy that doesn't depend on specific situations.

Just to use a contrived example (but one which I have seen occur): One of your opponents forgot to get eggs in a baking challenge. You have a sabotage that removes someone's eggs. Under no circumstances should you give your sabotage to that person, even if they already have 2 sabotages assigned to them. Dogpiling would be the worst possible strategy in that situation.

There are many similar examples, such of them more subtle, such as someone that has already lost their knives being given a second sabotage that takes away ingredients that need to be cut, and replaces them with precut ingredients of lesser quality. 

Also, much of the time, the ""dogpile"" strategy doesn't really help, because very often the first sabotage equally effects all of your opponents. So at the very least, an *additional* strategy is needed beyond just ""dogpile"". And it's never helpful on the first sabotage.","I think its best to skip buying sabotages in the first round and save money for the later rounds. I've seen people blow their money too early and have no way to defend themselves in the later rounds. Also you help avoid revenge sabotages, the first round can be such a crap shoot and while the dogpile might ensure one person leaves, you don't know if you've dogpiled a strong chef or a weak chef and wasted money.

Now in the second round I could see this working. If you and the third chef realizes that chef #2 is very strong and adaptable, dogpiling chef #2 would be a solid strategy.",A,A,"I would say reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a more nuanced perspective on the strategy of targeting sabotages in Cutthroat Kitchen. It acknowledges that there are situations where dogpiling may not be the best strategy, such as when a sabotage would be redundant or ineffective against a specific competitor. By considering the specific circumstances of each sabotage and competitor, reply A presents a more flexible and thoughtful approach to the game. 

On the other hand, reply B focuses on a different aspect of strategy - saving money for later rounds and avoiding early revenge sabotages. While this is a valid point, it does not directly address the original poster's argument about the benefits of dogpiling sabotages on a single competitor. 

Therefore, reply A is more likely to challenge the original poster's view and encourage them to reconsider their strategy in Cutthroat Kitchen."

Generally people telling the anecdote have a *reason* for telling the anecdote, which amplifies the ""oddness"" of the results you get.

E.g. people writing reviews for products are far more likely to write if they really hate the item or really love it than if they are just generally satisfied with it and it met their expectations. 

People talking about ""that one time they were at a bar and were able to pick up a girl with this one joke"" are telling that story not just *in spite* of it being unusual, but actually *because* it was unusual.

This an overgeneralization, but it's really pretty true:

Good data is collected with an understanding of how it is sampled, and what the biases are in selection.

Bad data is collected by asking a broad audience a question, and only listening to the ones that choose to answer the question.

Anecdotal evidence is like the latter.","Anecdotal evidence is often associated with selection bias. I agree that in some cases, it is useful. Asking a user of the product what it's like doesn't introduce very much bias (although even then, you'd trust the average star rating of 1000 users over any individual review).

The problem is when you only hear about people who've had a certain type of experience. If you only listen to anecdotal accounts of whether prayer works, for example, then you'll get a very biased view, because nobody likes to talk about times when prayer didn't work.

There are ways to get around this, of course, but most of the time, if you're listening to anecdotal data, you're not trying to debias it, or weighing it properly; so it tends to have a disproportionate effect on your thinking.",A,A,"I would say reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"This CMV post is partly inspired by this r/relationships [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3e4h7z/i_m38_want_to_surrender_our_severely_autistic_son/) I came across earlier today. This is also a topic I feel somewhat strongly about and I have not had a chance to really share my view on because it's sort of a ""taboo"" view to have.

To sum up the r/relationships post: OP's 4 year old son is severely autistic and OP has been told by doctors that his son will never function above the level of a 1 year old and will require constant care. Son is ruining OP's life and marriage, and is negatively affecting OP's 2 young daughters as well.

I do not believe the OP of that post, and the many other parents who are in a similar scenario, deserve to have their lives ruined just because they were ""dealt a bad hand"" and ended up with a disabled child. I think that euthanasia is a humane, simple solution to a problem like this. After all, we euthanize our loved cats and dogs that are no longer able to have a good, independent life. I don't see a fundamental difference between the two cases.

As for government-owned care facilities: I don't believe it is a good use of our resources as a society to continue to take care of individuals who have no chance to ever become functional members of society. Euthanasia is a much more economically and environmentally more efficient option.

What won't change my view: slippery slope/""where do we draw the line"" types of arguments. We are only discussing cases in which the child is beyond a shadow of a doubt unable to ever function independently. CMV.

Edit: I'm deeply sorry if I offended anybody, particularly those with autism/other disabilities, with this post. Please understand that I am not suggesting that anyone with autism be euthanized. My argument only applied to those who were not capable of basically doing anything besides eating, sleeping, and using the bathroom (with assistance). Anyone who is reading this post is FAR from even close to the level I'm talking about.

Certainly it is not ""independent,"" but who is to say it is not ""good?"" We don't know whether severely autistic people are generally happy or miserable--often they do not express happiness the way neurotypical people do but may report experiencing it. After all, autism is a communication disorder. We can't really ""share the experiences"" of someone with severe autism. And, of course, there are many other disabilities where we encounter the same question. We've no way to know whether they are enjoying themselves and their lives, because we can't ask in a way they understand and they can't tell us.

Now, I'm not talking about people with devastating, painful medical conditions who CAN tell us how they feel. I believe in assisted suicide for the terminally ill and greatly suffering. But I don't think we can reasonably extend that to someone who by definition cannot tell us if they are suffering or not.

Edit: You also mention the negative impact a child with a severe disability has on the family. While this is very sad, if it wouldn't be grounds for euthanizing any other child, why are disabled children different? What I mean is, if my family were suffering greatly because we could not afford to feed a child, say, or because we were overburdened by regular childcare needs, would we be able to euthanize the child? If not, why not, if effect on others matters? I'm not trying to make a slippery slope argument, I'm asking why a negative impact from a disabled child is different from a negative impact of a non-disabled child--which, depending on circumstance, could be equal or lesser.

Edit2: If you've come to tell me I don't know anything about taking care of disabled people, save it. I worked in a care facility and my brothers are autistic. I guess it isn't clear: my alternative plan to OP's euthanasia is not ""parents should suck it up,"" it's ""we should have a social safety net for this type of situation, including in and out of home care for these families, because that's what social safety nets are for."" There is no need to tell me that these families suffer because it is impossible to provide round the clock care--that is obvious to me.","1. Children are not their parents' possessions. A parent raising a child in their custody has a lot of control over that child, but they do not own them.  They therefore do not have the right to terminate them.  They can, however, give up their rights and responsibilities as a parent and surrender the child to adoptive parents, an organization, or the state.

2. 5 year olds may not be able to take care of themselves, but they still have inner selves, personalities, hopes and wants and fears.  The same goes for those with conditions like severe autism. That has value, even if they cannot live independently.

3. You cannot predict the future.  Some treatment may arise that drastically changes their ability to function. Schizophrenics can be greatly helped by medication today, maybe severely autistic people will be helped in 10 years.  Further, it is difficult to tell which autistic children will be able to gain some measure of independence later in life (see [here](http://www.autism-help.org/autism-prognosis-long-term.htm) for example).  Severity of symptoms as a child is far from a perfect predictor.

I'll leave you with this story of a particular child with autism that I heard about on radiolab. Here's an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/magazine/reaching-my-autistic-son-through-disney.html?_r=0) about it, but if you've got the time I'd highly recommend the [radiolab podcast](http://www.radiolab.org/story/juicervose/) itself.",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view.

Additionally, the user brings up the point that we cannot accurately determine the level of suffering or potential for improvement in severely disabled individuals, which challenges the idea of euthanasia as a solution. Overall, Reply A presents a thoughtful and empathetic perspective that may resonate with the original poster and encourage them to reconsider their view on euthanasia for severely disabled individuals."

This is true and useful.  But only a tiny percentage of animals in zoos are endangered.  Also, *keeping them in zoos* renders them unable to live in the wild.  A far more effective, long term method of preserving endangered species is to protect the wildlife in which they live.

&gt; either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild. 

Animals who are born, raised or otherwise spend long periods of time in zoos are no longer able to survive in the wild.  It's actually considered immoral to release them into the wild because they will die long before their ability to mate.  


&gt; zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies.


It is true that zoos bring animals closer to humans, but there isn't any evidence to show that humans are more caring of the wildlife environment as a result.  



Though, mostly zoo life for animals is a lot like prison life for humans.  No one would argue that a human in prison is alive.  Or that it's not cared for.  Humans have food, shelter, entertainment and social structure.  But all of the things that make life worth living are gone.  The ability to build a family.  The option to find a mate.  The ability to build the things in our lives which we each assign value to.  Animals are not so different.  They might mate with another because they are incited to.  But they often have ideas of who they like or don't.  They cannot hunt their food in spite of an evolutionary drive to do so.  Also, often, the topic of animal depression is discussed in zoos where it would be nearly nonexistant in the wild.

It is the guarantee of *life* which is more than the wild offers.  But it is a guarantee of a *type* of life which is less than is offered in freedom.","I actually agree with you, and could add many more reasons why zoos can be ethical, but that's not the point here so :

  - endangered animals can be cared for : It's true but it's only a very small portions of endangered animals that the public find cute or know about that will be protected this way. The reasons why some animals are protected in the wild or in a zoo are wildly irrational.

  - Most of these animals are 'exotic' and you concern has very little chance of changing things in these animals former countries. Also there are many other ways to attract attention to these animals than enslave them and put them in a cage. We actually did that at the World Expo in Brussels with Congolese tribesmen. And I can conclusively confirm that it wasn't really conductive to intercultural understanding and enlightenment. It was another freak show, and the exploitation of living beings for financial purposes.

So yes, zoo can be ethical but it has never been their vocation. They are not actual non-profit organizations.",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways of communication could hardly be any more different from ours.

A dog dragging you by the leash is not eager to play; it's showing you who the top dog is and ordering you to follow the pack leader (itself). A dog making eye contact is, again, asserting dominance--read: not affectionately gazing into its master's eyes. The list goes on. Seems like we've anthropomorphizing our cuddly partners a bit too much. Chances are, it's probably not thinking what most people think it's thinking. A dog that looks ""depressed"" to most of us is really just an obedient dog with a responsible owner. Man's best friend? That's some grade-a bull. Man's best friend is none other than fellow man. Dogs have no capacity for logic / reasoning skills and will bark at any stranger to feel better about themselves. We don't understand them very well, and they understand us even less. They've helped our hunter-gatherer ancestors, and are still useful to people with certain disabilities today. But that makes them no more than co-workers and can hardly be considered potential friends, given our inherent differences in nature.

That shows that they have some feelings about certain people.  For example, a dog gets a look at a leash and becomes excited and a bit raccous because it knows its going for a walk.  This is a reaction to a positive stimulus. A dog might demonstrate that same behavior when it sees its owner for the first time in a couple of days/weeks, clearly excited at the prospect of seeing its owner again.",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides specific examples and scenarios where dogs have shown emotional responses that go beyond just asserting dominance or following pack mentality. By highlighting these instances, Reply A challenges the original poster's belief that dogs are purely hierarchical creatures and shows that dogs can indeed have genuine feelings for their human companions. Additionally, Reply A acknowledges the original poster's point about projecting feelings onto dogs, but also presents counterarguments that suggest dogs are capable of forming emotional bonds with humans."

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","1. Pronunciation: yeah you can talk about the letters themselves, but what about when you have to use them? X is a harsh sound, demanding it's attention and rarely allowing for subtlety. Y's only whiny in one of its usages. Since it has several different sounds it can be used in a number of different ways, often to accentuate the sounds of other letters.

2. Exclusivity: X is a much more difficult letter to use. It's less common because the words it are used in are usually fairly specialized. Yes, Y takes a lot of credit for being in the ""-ly"" alliance, but I want to see you go a day without using Y. I can go a day without using X

3. Consistency. X is always a consonant to its detriment. Y is the only letter that's both a consonant and a vowel, allowing it to be applied to a significantly greater number of contexts. It's useful. X has to sit out and wait on its turn while y is readily available when I needs to take a breather.

4. Scrabble. X has caused more scrabble fights than Y ever will, and as someone else has said, it's twice as hard to find a use for the letter

5. Math. Yes, x is always the first variable, but it's not like y is that far behind. And x may be the consistent axis, but the variable y axis is where the really interesting stuff comes up. In a simple graph relating distance over time, yeah the time is important, but we're really interested in how far the object traveled, which is the value on the y axis.

6. Appearance. Ok, tbh, I agree with you here

7. Sex. I got nothing here. Point for X

8. History. I did a quick Wikipedia search on the presidents. 12 of them had y in their names, including John Quincy Adams, Ulysses Grant, and Harry Truman. The only president with X in his name is Nixon.

9. Versatility in other areas. I'll grant that we use X significantly more outside of writing, but I will point out that these are generally negative connotations and that Y's extreme versatility as a letter likely outweighs X's advantage here.

10. Apparently Y was not an original Roman numeral, so point to X.

11. No one has ever been born or fallen in love in a state beginning with the letter x either. EDIT: yeah I forgot about Texas and New Mexico too

12. If we're talking about unknown items, we can also say ""X is worse than Y""

Haha this was fun :)

EDIT: 

Letter count: Use CTRL+F to see the massive discrepancy between X usage and Y usage in this thread alone.","Okay, let's set some things straight here. 

&gt; Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit whiny, perhaps because is is too close to ""why.""

The question ""why?"" is reflective of a thirst for a deeply analytical understanding of something. Questions like ""what"" and ""who"" are so simple and provide so little information. ""Why,"" on the other hand, is a question which yields a far more informative, useful, and powerful response than any question of the same family. ""Why"" isn't whiny. It's conducive to knowledge. Hence, the pronunciation of the letter Y is better than X simply *because* Y sounds like why, and why is a powerful question. Much more powerful than any pronunciation of X.

&gt; Exclusivity. Only about 300 words in English start with X. Y starts over 700

Since when does lack of usage make something cool? To me, it makes something really lame. For example, who wants to hang out with the kid that no one wants to hang out with? Who wants the broken bike nobody wants to ride? Who wants the flat basketball no one wants to use? In my experience, if people aren't using something, then there's a reason. That reason is probably because they don't like it or don't find it cool. Ask the iWatch how cool it feels that no one wants to use it. What about Zune? Everyone I know loves Zune. So much, in fact, that absolutely none of them use it! As you can see, people don't use things when they suck, as is the case for the letter X. Y is used in more words because Y is a significantly more fun letter to use. X isn't used as much because it's a tricky little bastard that doesn't lend itself to be used. X is like a really smart douche bag. He/she could be really useful if he/she wasn't so fucking tough to work with. Douche bag X

&gt; Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind.

Because everyone knows that lack of variety is the spice of life! At least for me, I love watching the exact same TV show episode over and over again. So consistent and fun. Conversely, Y is a wild dude. He doesn't wanna get tied down with one or two different tasks. He's a peacock that needs to spread his wings. And peacocks are cool, man. So much coolers than X. In fact, [a recent study by Harvard](http://reddit.com) proves that peacocks are up to 5 times cooler than X with half the trans fat. Ball's in your court, X.

&gt; Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4).

This reminds me of a Dimitri Martin skit. I'm going to misquote it but you'll get the gist. ""I was sitting on this air plane when I heard this guy say to his friend, 'Man, I'm really good at checkers.'   That's like sayings, 'Man, I'm not good at a lot of things.' ""      This is exactly what X is doing here. Scrabble is super lame. On a scale of ""Full House"" to ""Greg House"", Scrabble is like a ""Roseanne."" (Nick@Night references) Consequently, X needs to brag about something, but X pretty much sucks at everything and has to brag about Scrabble. Poor guy. Y doesn't need to be good at Scrabble because Y is good at stuff like getting checks and getting sex.

&gt; Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable. 

Yeah, but in math, Y is usually the dependent variable. Now, I know what you're thinking. ""But Bongloads4breakfast, independence is so cool. Just look at the United States. They declared that shit and they're pretty cool."" This is the product of hegemonic capitalism and its social constructs. It's better for everyone if people become dependent on each other. If everyone is dependent on one another, then everyone has a reason to be kind to one another. You wanna know what's cooler than independence? Kindness.  

&gt; Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze.

Bull shit. Bull FUCKING shit. You know what looks exactly like Y? Just about every tree that exists. Trees withstand strong breezes all the time with no problems. On top of that, trees provide oxygen for us. Y = Trees = Oxygen &gt; X which also means Y &gt; X. This isn't groundbreaking. This is simply arithmetic. 

&gt; Sex.

I remember somebody telling me that JFK only lasted one minute in bed with his wife. You know why? JFK didn't have time to waste. Y has to be out there pumping out oxygen all day. As far as I'm concerned, I'd much rather have oxygen than sex. 

&gt; History. Malcolm X

Malcolm X is pretty cool. Definitely one flaw in my argument would be that Malcolm X is cool. However, the Beatles are far cooler than Malcolm X. I'm pretty sure that's a given. Guess what the Beatles sing. YYYYYYYellow Submarine. So the much cooler Beatles like using the letter Y which, ipso facto means that Y is cooler. 

&gt; Versatility in other areas.

Y can also function as one of the most basic yet insanely strong questions ""Why"". Talk about versatility",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides counterarguments to each of the original poster's points in a logical and well-reasoned manner. The user in Reply A acknowledges the strengths of the original poster's arguments but effectively counters them with alternative perspectives. Additionally, Reply A maintains a respectful and engaging tone throughout the response, making it more likely to be received positively by the original poster. Overall, Reply A presents a strong case for why Y may be better than X in various aspects."
predict-explain,"To start: **I am *not* saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing.**

However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there's some psychological affliction behind it, but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well, but psychologists realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course, any religious objections are right out.

So with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled, I'm left without any good reason why siblings should marry each other. CMV

Edit 1: Added emphasis.

Edit 2: Stepping away for a bit. I'll be back in a few hours. (8:45pm, GMT)

Edit 3:
Deltas awarded to:
/u/SquirrelPower for pointing out that there is a legal difference between types of classes. /u/the-friendzoner made a similar argument, that the sexual attraction of incest is different than an orientation. 

I don't consider these sufficient reasons to continue the ban, but they are distinct from the reasons given for banning homosexuality, so they fulfill the terms of my post.

This is true, and I'll grant that a key component of the recent ruling was that marriage cannot be distinguished based on a couple's ability to have, or preference for, children. So, in that sense, I understand why you want to dismiss that factor altogether. However, there's a substantial line between a homosexual couple and an incestuous heterosexual one: the former can have sex or not have sex, but no matter what, their sexual lives will not impact the lives of anyone else; the latter, however, will result in a significantly higher chance of producing a child with a lower quality-of-life. True, marriage does not equal procreation, but by sanctioning that relationship, the government would be supporting a relationship that may negatively impact the lives of their future offspring. 

I imagine a common argument to this might be that we allow marriage for individuals who knowingly have a higher genetic chance of passing on an abnormal trait, but we cannot simply disallow marriage entirely for one person. Similarly, it's wrong to ban marriage of an entire sexual orientation. People have the right to fall in love and get married. However, that is not the same as banning the marriage of an incestuous couple, as those individuals can still fall in love within their desired orientation, outside of the family, and get married in a relationship that will statistically produce healthier children.","The main problem with your argument is that gays are a *class* of people, while people with incestuous feelings are just individuals with incestuous feelings.

Basically, it is wrong to discriminate against people simply because they belong to a specific group. It is, however, perfectly OK to discriminate against individuals because of their individual traits.

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspect_classification#Federal_classifications) are some of the legal definitions of what constitutes a 'class' of people. I'm not going to summarize 'em. You have to do some work and read 'em yourself. But the two main groups are the suspect classes and the rational-basis classes. *Suspect* classes include race or religion, and the government needs to show a compelling reason to allow discrimination. *Rational-basis* classes are groups like criminals vs. non-criminals, where there may be a rational reason to allow discrimination.

Two choice quotes:

&gt;In Perry v. Schwarzenegger, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in its Findings of Fact commented that sexual orientation could be considered a **suspect** class[...]

and:

&gt;Striking down Section 3 of DOMA as unconstitutional in Windsor v. United States (2012), the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals held sexual orientation to be a **quasi-suspect** classification

Here you have the courts arguing over which kind of classification that gays belong to (*suspect* vs. *quasi-suspect* class) but agreeing that gays do belong to something stronger than just a rational-basis classification.

Siblings with incestuous feelings? I guarantee they would fall under the 'rational-basis' classification, meaning there is a lower bar for the gov't to clear in order to justify discrimination.",B,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a legal framework for understanding the difference between discriminating against a class of people (such as homosexuals) and discriminating against individuals with certain traits (such as incestuous feelings). By highlighting the legal classifications of suspect classes and rational-basis classes, reply B effectively argues that while discrimination against a class of people is not justified, discrimination against individuals based on certain traits may be permissible. This distinction helps to address the original poster's concerns about the similarities and differences between homosexuality and incest, providing a logical basis for why allowing one while not allowing the other may be justified."
predict-explain,"**Some Definitions**

**Islamism** - Political Movements that use Islam to justify either their end goals (ie. a religious state, or ""caliphate"") or the means they use (ie. violence, terrorism).

**Islam** - Religion with 1 billion followers worldwide. Draws doctrine from the Qu'ran (a holy book) and the Hadith (the biography of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)). 

**Sheik** - An educated religious leader that are theological scholars, and have power to issue religious opinions/rulings, known as *fatwas.*



My case is this.

* **Fighting Islamic Terrorism through military force DOES NOT WORK.**
The emergence of ISIS/ISIL/Daesh is strong evidence that foreign invasions cannot create stability in a country.

* **A key feature of Islamic Terrorism is theological ignorance.**
Islam only permits violence in certain circumstances, which are fairly well established. This mirrors a general ignorance among Muslims of what Islam is. This is compounded by the fact that Sheiks pass on their knowledge to students via a mentoring process. Lines of Sheiks are dying out due to a lack of willing students, and knowledge is being lost with them. The pull of Islamism on young men may be contributing to this.

* **A greater understanding of Islam is incompatible with Islamism** - The Qu'ran is a suprisingly thought-provoking text, even for the secular reader. It constantly promotes critical thinking, and warns against interpreting its verses in a dogmatic way. A study of the life of the Prophet (pbuh), where he only fought as a last resort and was firmly against the killing of non-combatants, is totally at odds with Islamists. The fact that modern Islamist organisations (eg. Al-Quaeda, ISIL) are theologically innovative (rather than trying to get back to 7th Century Islam) is something that Al-Quaeda openly admits and is one of their most obvious flaws to Muslim observers.

My solution is that the West, with its traditions of academic study and economic power at the greatest they have ever been, should help educate Muslim countries about their own religion. Education should be at the grass roots level, the theological, and academic levels. I think there is a rather poetic justification in that the Islamic Empire safeguarded many of the texts of Europe and the Greeks at the time Europe was going through its Dark Ages. A similar thing could be argued to be taking place in the Muslim World today. 

**TL;DR** - I think it would be more effective, more sustainable, and it would diffuse the antipathy towards Islam in the Western World. It answers a lot of the current political problems in Muslim countries and would help establish Islam as the progressive force I believe it has always been, rather than the regressive and conservative force people fear it to be.

Typically, all we require is self-identification as Muslim, and then the person defines _his_ Islam.

We try not to sign off on particular versions as authentic or real, and instead try to present the history, the branches, etc. Islamism finds itself on the tree of Islam when Islam is treated academically, and the idea that we couldn't somehow trace it back to the roots, that it would clearly be shown to be inauthentic, seems implausible.

If it's really to be treated academically, the message will be chaos. I'd like to compare it to my first steps into studying Christianity academically. I had a single view of Christianity in mind and believed that it was essentially straightforward, although there were minor wobbles. Catholics killed lots, Martin Luther saved us, and then America.

I reacted in horror when I finally dug into Christianity academically. Not only were there Catholics, but there were Orthodox. And people who didn't think Jesus was God. And unitarians. And universalists. There were churches in Ethiopia and there were monophysites and diopho-whatevers. There were Chinese Christians who had some pretty weird views. Ebionites, which sounded racist. And God knows what relationship God, the Jews, and Christians are supposed to have.

It was chaos. An academic study of a religion rarely reveals a single, pure source. This is true in Islam too - few generations after the Prophet, the ummah is already split. And today it still is. Not just Sunni/Shia. There are also Ahmaddiya/Qadiani, who to outsiders are indistinguishible. There are four major schools of fiqh. And maybe this is the isnad for the use of the miswak during fasting, or maybe it's a pile of spaghetti.

... and all of this plays directly into the hands of the Islamist. The average person will recoil from all the choice he's just been presented. All the Islamist has to do is present his purified, simple version, and he's saved the day. The average person does not want, cannot tolerate, cannot sustain so much complexity. The Islamist message is appealing _because_ it gives straightforward, unambiguous answers that do not require three pages of footnotes, even if they're wrong.

You want thinkers, but you cannot turn your average person into a ""thinker."" This is not an insult - I've taught hundreds of good people, many of whom nevertheless fail to master any significant level of critical thinking. I know that most people fail not because of capacity, but because their environment does not afford them the sort of leisure they need. They have families. They have jobs.

Besides, the West coming in to teach the Muslim world its faith... the audacity of the idea is breathtaking. Even if we were best positioned to do it, we'd hardly be the best positioned to do it. The backlash would probably invalidate the entire project.

I'm not saying it wouldn't help for the average Muslim to know more about his religion. Any bit of extra knowledge anywhere would help. But simply because #1) military interventions haven't worked and #2) an educated populace would be nice, doesn't mean this is a workable solution.","&gt; Education should be at the grass roots level

That goes against your entire plan, It is not the responsibility of the west to ""educate"" muslims, That approach has resulted in nothing by continuous infantilization of muslims, treating them like irresponsible children that have no control over their own decisions.

&gt; A greater understanding of Islam is incompatible with Islamism

Interpretation of religious texts does magically yield liberal ideals. There are more Islamic scholars, more educated literate muslims now then there have ever been in the history of Islam.  Islamism does not only grow from fertile soil of ignorance, It is a coherent set of ideologies that has a wide support of both the uneducated masses and highly educated politicized muslims.

Here's a better solution: Stop coddling muslims, stop thinking it is the responsibility of the west to ""westernize"" the muslim world. 

Personally I think religion is bad, I'd prefer to see a world with no religion, If you manage to somehow read into the life of Muhammad and make that work in your head with a liberal point of view, That's awesome, But thinking you somehow got there because you have a more ""correct"" or ""enlightened"" understanding of his life is utter nonsense.",A,A,"I would say that reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a detailed and nuanced argument against the original poster's proposal. It highlights the complexity of Islam as a religion and the diversity of beliefs within the Muslim community. The response also points out the potential pitfalls of Western intervention in educating Muslims about their own religion, emphasizing the importance of respecting cultural autonomy and avoiding a paternalistic approach.

On the other hand, reply B takes a more confrontational and dismissive tone towards the original poster's ideas. It focuses on the idea that it is not the responsibility of the West to educate Muslims and suggests a more hands-off approach. While reply B does make some valid points about the limitations of education in combating extremism, it lacks the depth and nuance of reply A's argument. 

Overall, reply A presents a more well-reasoned and thoughtful rebuttal to the original poster's proposal, making it more likely to change their view."

For instance you presume that rarity is 'better' than versatility.  The letter Y is far more versatile than the letter X, it can be used in many more words and is flexible enough to stand in for vowels when using them makes a word look horrible.  On that basis the letter Y also has great aesthetic appeal.

You assume that consistency is better when versatility could just as easily be argued to be better.

You assume that having the word ex in sex is good, but in order to describe the magnitude of sex something exudes you need to add the y on the end (sexy).

Number 11 is just plan false as I'm sure many people die each year in Texas, and New Mexico.","1) X may sound cooler, but the sound isn't exclusive. It can be similarly made with an -ecs or -ecks if you want. There's no way to reproduce the sound of y.

2)  Exclusivity does not mean something is better. X is certainly used less, which I would argue makes it a more useless letter. If you could have a key that opens 10 treasure chests, or a key that opens 20, which would you choose? Certainly the more useful one.

3) X may always be a consonant, but it also doesn't always sound the same. Sometimes it's an -ecs sound, sometimes it's a z sound. ""xylophone"" and ""for example""

4)  X is only worth so many points because of it's uselessness. It's like getting paid to take the worst player in sports. Only Q is more useless in scrabble, so much so that they had to add the u to it.

5)  As others have said, X works for Y. It's like the factory worker and the boss. Who gets paid more? Even so, eventually the greek letters beat all of them out.

6)  Y may be more unstable, but it can easily be pounded into the ground like a stake. The X isn't as easy. Or it could just stand there. I've never seen one fall over, so it must be quite talented at standing there.

8)  X is history, you're right. Y is the future though. See Terminator Genysis.

predict-explain,"Throwaway account, my main is used for school.  

I'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She frequently brings up marriage and talks about how she believes I'll never propose to her, and I've told her that I'm honestly not sure how I feel about the whole concept of marriage. I would have no problem staying with her for my entire life, but I just don't understand how a ring and a piece of paper makes any difference.

Let me outline my preconceptions here: My parents' marriage fell apart due to infidelity and divorce. I watched my mom cheat on my dad, take all his money in court, and leave him psychologically damaged until the day he died. Admittedly it has me a bit scared.

Here are the benefits I often hear claimed about marriage, along with my response to them:

* More sex: We've been like bunnies for the whole relationship (at least twice a day) and honestly I have a pretty low sex drive. It's already more than enough.

* Children: I don't want kids, don't have kids, and am 100% sterile by choice. Nothing to do about it. She is equally happy to go without them.

* Added financial benefit / tax breaks: We already contribute equally to the relationship in terms of finances. We end up paying for everything about 50/50. Tax breaks? Ok, sure, but that's not going to sell me on it right off the bat.


Now here are some drawbacks I often see cited about marriage, along with my response:


* Expense: A ring is supposed to cost three month's salary?! A wedding costs over $10,000?! I'm a grad student, for crying out loud. This kind of stuff is absolutely not affordable, and even if it was it seems like a huge waste just to conform to a social norm. Paying more for a little bit of metal and rock than for a decent used car seems absolutely insane to me.


* Divorce Risk: Statistics don't lie. I have a 50/50 chance of going through exactly what my late father did.


I hate seeing how sad the thought of just being my girlfriend forever (but not my wife) makes her.  I love this girl a lot, but I am also a very rational and logical person and can't seem to find the personal justification for marriage.

Please, try to change my view - and thank you.

Edit 1:  Whoever you are, thank you for mass-downvoting all my responses.  I'm trying to have a civil discourse, and if I'm frustrating you I don't mean anything negative by it.

Edit 2:  Thank you all for your insight.  I have awarded one delta on this topic but for the most part I have not been convinced that marriage is for me.  Consider this CMV closed, although I may check back later to respond to any trailing opinions.

I appreciate your time, and thank you very much.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","I don't know about your jurisdiction, but if the downside for you is the legal risk of divorce/financial  support, etc.  You may already be incurring that risk by being in a cohabiting relationship.  Common-law spouses are treated very similarly to married ones.  In which case the only reason for not marrying your girlfriend is cost of wedding/etc.

Those costs can be reduced by the way. Some people don't get rings at all and get hitched at town hall for next to nothing.","Marriage is an emotional commitment more than anything. Reason can pull you both ways, either into it for financial and legal reasons (tax cuts, if there was ever an accident you'd be legally recognized as next of kin, etc.) or out of it for practicality reasons. Unless you're religious and/or you desire offspring, marriage is something that can be easily considered trivial.


That said, I can see how your experience with divorce has colored your views, and rightly so. But you need to not let fear of a single potential outcome determine your approach to something. Especially if that something is a thing that someone you consider precious would like as part of her future.


Consider for a moment what marriage in the modern day is... In truth, it's just legally recognized love. That is to say that if you love this girl, and you're already committed to her wholly, then you're emotionally already married but without the tax cuts, the legal recognition, and the failsafe should things go sour (divorce court). 


And as an aside, as many have said, the expense of a wedding is not something that needs to be a concern unless it's of personal concern to you both. Personally, my husband and I bought wooden rings off Etsy (his was $60, mine was $200 because it's ebony from Isreal), and we eloped. The expense? The price of the marriage license and the fuel to get it. And let me tell you, I have zero regrets about that, it was exactly how we wanted it when we wanted it. 


And a little bonus, people like giving wedding gifts. We set up a GoFundMe page because we didn't want gifts, but cash, and ended up coming out with over a grand in gift money. So it's not all bad =)",B,B,"I believe reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more empathetic and emotional perspective on marriage, highlighting the idea that marriage is a legally recognized form of love and commitment. It addresses the OP's fears and reservations about marriage due to their parents' divorce, encouraging them not to let fear dictate their decisions. Additionally, it offers a personal anecdote about a low-cost wedding alternative, showing that marriage doesn't have to be extravagant or expensive. 

Overall, reply B takes a more holistic approach to the concept of marriage, emphasizing the emotional and practical benefits while also acknowledging the OP's concerns. It presents a more well-rounded argument that may resonate with the OP's feelings and ultimately be more persuasive in changing their view."
predict-explain,"EDIT: a portion of replies I'm getting are focused on the defination of 'libertarian' and the rainbow of american groups that claim it for their particular beliefs. If in doubt, replace 'libertarian' with 'minimally regulated, minimal government intervention' in the following argument.

---

Disclaimer, I'm a Brit who's also lived and worked in several developing countries, so I've seen first hand the damage, exploitation and general cost to societies of un-regulated (or highly corrupt) health and safety at work laws. I also don't have the same knee-jerk association of unions and criminal gangs that seems to prevail in discussions I've watched americans have. 

---
That said, let's move into the meat of the disscusion. 
1) a libertarian economy is not interfered with by the goverment. You want to force people to sign slavery contracts? it's allowed. By the same token however, there are no laws preventing people from forming unions, or those unions taking action to promote the interest of their members. If [the industry can maintain blacklists](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/27/on-the-blacklist-building-firms-secret-information-on-workers), so can the unions. If ]a company decides to close stores to punish union members](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/walmart-accused-of-closing-stores-in-retaliation-for-workers-demanding-better-pay-and-conditions-10193668.html?origin=internalSearch), they run the risk of a rival firm that will work with unions taking the bulk of the sales in that area.

An antagonistic culture between unions and corporations is not the only option of course, and companies with forms that favour longer term thinking (like walmart, ironically) but also Waitrose in the uk (employee owned) might thrive when others get bogged down in strikes and penalties.

2) unions get more and more effective the larger they get. At heart, they are simply rebalancing the power between a huge corporation and a single worker. The largest unions appeared in nationalised industries - the largest conglomerates of the day. There is a strong selection pressure for small unions themselves to form alliances, or even full unions with each other to increase their bargining power. An ineffective union will loose members to a more effective one and the market will deliver :)

3) the unions themselves suffer the problem of free-riders. People who do not join but benefit from the union driving up minimum working standards and safety. If providing things like out-of-work support costs the union (and thus the corporations they work with) then companies that manage to avoid using union workforce will face a slight advatnage. As such, for strong unions, it is wise to agitate for political change, so that all workplaces have to conform to those same standards, that union type out of work support have to be applied to the entire workforce to prevent more predatory models from gaining a competitive advantage.
This also has the advantage, especially at the minimum level of starvation, slavery and loss of limb I've seen, of being a moral thing to do. 

4) Some people may have a very high risk tolerance (for whatever reason), and want to do without the safety nets and complain at the cost or inconvenience it puts on them as an employer, employee or as a tax payer. They will continue to complain, but when their individual demands conflict with organised forces, whether as a corporation, worker's union, or an insurance company, they will loose.","&gt; unions get more and more effective the larger they get. At heart, they are simply rebalancing the power between a huge corporation and a single worker. 

Your thesis is a little all over the place, but this statement,in particular, is idealistic. Recently, Unions in LA demanded the right to negotiate for less than minimum wage for their workers? Why? Because they are losing members and by having union workers paid less, they would be more likely to have union people hired, and thus, union membership rolls would swell, and unions would earn more money. In other words, they were incentivized to act like the profit making organization they claimed to be fighting against.

In any case, Libertarians don't have a problem with private sector unions. But they tend to dislike laws that force people to pay union dues, even if those said people don't feel like the union is representing them in any meaningful way.","Unions wouldn't exist at all because of free rider and collective action problems.  There are no laws that make unions illegal in right-to-work states in the US, and unions generally can't survive there because not enough people pay dues/join if they aren't forced to do so.   Also, it would be far too risky for an individual employee or small group to attempt to organize a union--the employer would just fire all of the organizers.  The only reason employees can organize unions now is because labor laws prohibit firing workers for union activity.",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides a real-world example of unions acting in a way that goes against the traditional view of unions as defenders of workers' rights. By highlighting this behavior, Reply A challenges the original poster's idealistic view of unions as simply rebalancing power between workers and corporations. Additionally, Reply A acknowledges that Libertarians don't necessarily have a problem with private sector unions but take issue with laws that force people to pay union dues. This nuance in understanding the Libertarian perspective may help the original poster see a different side to the argument."
predict-explain,"It all sound the same to me. And to be clear, I know this is what people tend to say about any music they don't ""get."" People say this about rap -- it's just noise, etc. But I like rap, and I think you can make a pretty good argument that there's a ton of variety in rap. From voice to lyrics to production to rhythm, there's really no reason to say Aesop Rock sounds like Mobb Deep, or a track off Illmatic sounds like a Drake mixtape.

I like a lot of types of popular music but don't like punk/hardcore. I looked up hardcore on wikipedia and it seemed like the songs had to fall within a pretty narrow range of genre conventions: short length, driving bass rhythm, simple chords, heavy distortion, shouted lyrics.

So my question is: what does a punk/hardcore fan listen for? What kind of stuff makes a good punk song if the songs are very similar in key respects, or am I missing the boat and there's a lot of variety out there? 

Anyway, I am not trying to be a hater, I'm just out of the loop on this music and its appeal. Thanks.","Are you talking about old-school punk/hardcore, or do you mean the punk/hardcore genre as a whole? You seem to be against 80's hardcore, because lots of 90's and new-school punk is very melodic music made by proficient musicians. As an example, listen to ""Pacific Standard Time"" by No Use For A Name.

But anyways, on to 80's hardcore. While the hallmark of the genre is what you described, there are lots of glaring exceptions. Bad Religion made excellent hardcore punk, yet Graffin never saw the need to shout. Instead, you'll find the singer's grandfatherly voice carrying the song with a catchy melody. If you want an example of this, listen to ""I Want to Conquer the World"".

The importance of lyrics can't be understated. The cornerstone of punk is the message. Even if you can't hear the words, you can usually figure out what the song is railing against, right? I mean, minimalist hip-hop is much the same, if my memory serves me correctly. Word-play and witty lyricism come before making any aurally pleasing backbeat. As an example, here's a little sample of a Bad Religion song ""Going through a word of sad debris/Regard quixotic reveries of ownership/The blossoming disease of man called tenure and accretion, the ancient western treadmill of deception and derision, but I want something more.""

So now we get to to the standard hardcore band. These bands are cabable of creating visceral heaviness with nothing but pure anger. Yet, they still remain accessible and catchy. Example: ""Lights Out"" by the Angry Samoans. The energy s what grabs a lot of people, as far as the genre goes. Some people just can't get enough of the quadruple-time d-beat.

For your homework, listen to ""Out of Step"" by Minor Threat. This is hardcore punk that many people will tell you is the best. I have to agree.

Some of my favorite hardcore albums:

Bad Religion - ""No Control""  
Hot Water Music - ""Fuel For The Hate Game""
Minor Threat - ""Discography"" 
Refused - ""The Shape of Punk to Come""
Husker 	Du - ""Zen Arcade""  

Check any of those out. I would almost suggest listening to more modern or 90's punk bands, as a way to be eased into the genre. NOFX and Against Me! are great places to start. You can work backwards from there.","Punk music originated amongst people lacking traditional music training and the resources to make professional-sounding music. They were often performing for small groups of people in non-traditional venues.

That is the same as early hip-hop.

Punk music can be made by people with limited talent. But a talented (not trained, talented) guitarist, bassist, drummer and screamer can make short, fast songs that make people excited.

Early punk was only accidentally groundbreaking. Just as Brooklyn kids didn't have full bands for their parties so they used DJs, punks couldn't play well so they turned up the distortion and did the best they could.

But in time, punk evolved. It kept the short, fast and simple style, but there actually are talented singer/songerwriters in punk, as well as great (if not virtuoso) instrumentation.

Compare the DJing of early hip-hop to modern radio hits. It sounds completely different. But that is only because we've listened enough to understand the subtlety. An old fuddy-duddy might say that both Aesop Rock and Mobb Deep are both guys talking over drums and pops.

Would you think it's crazy for me to say that a Black Flag record sounds very different to me than the Misfits. It is loud, sloppy guitars and screamy lyrics, say the fuddy-duddys. True, but I know enough about sloppy guitars and screamy lyrics to know which ones I like and which I don't.

I guess the best metaphor is some people say ""if you've seen one football match, you've seen them all."" There are some similarities, for sure. People running around, kicking balls. But the more you get into football, the more you are able to enjoy it.

I'd like to give you some homework. Listen to ""Blitzkrieg Bop"" by the Ramones. It is like the ""Rapper's Delight"" of Punk. Then listen to ""Last Caress"" by the Misfits. The message of the song is that the singer wants to kill a baby, rape a mother, and kill himself.

Tell me if you think those sound similar.",A,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a more detailed and informative explanation of the punk/hardcore genre, including examples of different styles within the genre and recommendations for specific songs and albums to listen to. It also emphasizes the importance of lyrics and message in punk music, which may help the original poster appreciate the genre more. Additionally, reply A acknowledges the original poster's perspective and offers a way for them to ease into the genre by starting with more modern or 90's punk bands. Overall, reply A provides a more thorough and helpful response to the original poster's question."
predict-explain,"I have recently been told that my pro-life position is ""forcing my ideas on others"".  I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary.  This "" forcing ideals on others"" is an argument I hear often and I just want to understand it better. I believe that a fetus is a human being. I confess, that is my view, not everyone's view. I believe an abortion is the murder of that child. This is still my view. Not everyone's. United States law entitles all humans to life. Passing legislation opposing abortion is simply following that idea in my way. I am not forcing anyone to agree with me. I am simply making sure the law is followed as I read it. 

For a hypothetical:

It's 1870 and there is a white who believes that black people are subhuman (not so uncommon at the time). If I say no they are not subhuman. They are human beings and I will prosecute you if you kill them am I "" forcing my ideals on them"" or am I simply protecting what I believe to be human life. And even if I am ""forcing my ideals"" on the man isn't it necessary to do so?  

The abortion debate is a matter of whether the fetus is indeed entitled to the rights of a living human. It has nothing to do with a group forcing it's ideas on another and such statements are only used to unjustly vilify the pro-life movement.","I think it is forcing your view on others.  

Sometimes that's ok.  For instance, it is my view that violent assault is morally wrong, and I believe it is appropriate to force that belief on others via the government.  So I support the criminalization of violent assault.

There are things which I think are morally wrong which I do not think should be criminal.  For instance, psychic readers are charlatans who part vulnerable people from their money with bogus and emotionally manipulative parlor tricks.  Being a psychic as a profession is fundamentally evil.

However, because the principles of free speech are so important, I am not ok with the idea of using government force to imprison people for doing this act.

You are holding two views:

1.  Abortion is morally wrong.

2.  Abortion is the type of moral wrong which the government should use force to ban.

It is possible to hold both of these views, or just number 1, or neither 1 nor 2.  I don't think you could hold 2 but not 1.

In any case, as to the example you gave about murdering a black person - yes, that is forcing your ideas on others.  But sometimes that's okay.  I won't go after whether or not you should think abortion to be morally wrong.  I won't even go after whether you think it should be banned by law.  But when you say something should be banned by law, you are forcing your ideas onto others, or at least trying to.","1. Can you cite an actual law guaranteeing all humans life? 

2. Abortion does not end a life, it stops a mass of cells from developing into a person. That's my belief, and I have actual science to back up my belief. Why should YOUR belief supersede mine? Especially when it comes to my right to make choices about MY life and MY body?

3. When you harass women outside of clinics, when you try to pass legislation dictating what they can do with their own bodies, when you try to pass legislation that endangers their lives, you are not just ""forcing your ideals"" on them, you're saying that you know better than them what is right for them. You don't. You're free to believe whatever you want to believe about when a fetus becomes a person, PERSON being the real key here, but you're not free to impose those beliefs on anyone's life but your own, nor should you EVER be free to do so. 

4. Unless you're going to care for that unwanted child you want to force some girl to carry in her body, risking her life and health for, for the rest of its life once its born, stop calling yourself ""pro-life"" and admit that you're actually only pro-birth. 

5. You ask ""am I forcing my ideals on others or am I simply protecting what I believe to be human life""? The answer is yes. Both. You may well believe a fetus is a person from conception. You'd be wrong, but you can believe it. But here's the thing: by trying to pass legislation based on that belief, you're forcing your ideals on others. And in this case, that is not okay.",A,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B provides a more comprehensive and detailed argument that challenges the original poster's beliefs with logical reasoning and evidence. Reply B also addresses the ethical implications of forcing one's beliefs on others and highlights the importance of personal autonomy and bodily autonomy. Additionally, Reply B raises important points about the practical implications of banning abortion and the inconsistency of being ""pro-life"" without considering the well-being of the mother and child after birth. Overall, Reply B presents a strong argument that is likely to make the original poster reconsider their position."
predict-explain,"**Update! See Edit #2 below!**

I don't know much about politics. I have a pretty poor understanding of real world economics. I don't follow world events or watch the news. I generally don't bother to keep track of what's going on in the world unless it impacts me directly, or maybe I think there's something meaningful I can do to change it to my own benefit (which has never actually come up).

When it comes to who should be elected in any local, state or federal capacity, or what laws should or should not be passed, I am simply not a qualified to provide input on any level.

So why am I allowed to vote?

Changing my view may require addressing the following positions of mine:

* If one wishes to cast any kind of vote related to government or legislation, one should be required to complete some sort of test to confirm that they understand the subject on which they are voting. This could include acknowledgment of a candidate's qualifications and positions, or the *actual content* of a particular bill. This has the added benefit of rendering wild claims and accusations made by the media, random bloggers, etc. less impactful on the views of the general public. *Note: Regarding this point, I don't want to discuss the specific content of such tests. As a rule, I believe it can be known what is true and what isn't, and so let's assume that the pre-vote tests won't contain personal opinions or interpretations of the subject.*

* If voting is limited to only citizens deemed ""qualified"" by some form of the process described in the previous bullet point, the general outcome is more likely to be better (e.g. the people are more likely to choose a candidate they will still approve of a year later, and there will be less confusion regarding what is contained in proposed bills, etc.).

* The ""right to vote"" should be a privilege that I am not entitled to if I'm not even going to take the time to research the subject.

Change my view by convincing me that, as a 29 year old citizen of the United States of America, I deserve to be able to vote on important matters and issues without doing any research or showing that I understand what I'm voting for/against.

Edit #1: Changed some phrasing.

Edit #2: **IMPORTANT**: The difficulty associated with determining who is qualified to vote and who isn't seems to be the main issue here. I can accept that, and kind of figured this would be the case. I would like to simplify things by clarifying the overall view that I would be interested in changing.

My view is that, assuming we *could* somehow successfully identify qualified individuals for a given subject and restrict the polls to only these people, it would be advantageous to do so at the expense of the (Constitutional?) right to uninformed voting.

In general, I feel that it's justifiable to say that no American citizen should be allowed to cast a vote regarding a subject about which he/she doesn't have a clear and accurate understanding.

predict-explain,"I just read this [article](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-adv-asian-race-tutoring-20150222-story.html#page=1) stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering that only certain minorities have an easier time getting in, while others like asians have a much harder time. It should be based on your grade average and the score you get on your SAT (I'm from Canada so I'm not really sure how SAT score factors into that. I'm used to only your high school grades being counted). If an asian student gets a 90% average, his/her application shouldn't be tossed aside for a black student who only managed to get an 83% average. Maybe in the past affirmative action was necessary, due to racial bias. Nowadays it's completely useless and does nothing but inhibit asians and whites.

I believe your race shouldn't matter when it comes to these things. It's like saying blacks and hispanics are more stupid than asians and whites and therefore should get some help to get into college. Also, before you say that it has to do with economic status, I would like to disagree. My family (including cousins and whatnot) came from very poor circumstances. However, most of my cousins have gone on to get degrees in things like engineering. If you don't do good in school, it's either because your capacity to learn in that certain subject or in general is lower than other people (say being bad at math or English) or you just didn't try hard enough.

And we have a very different racial make-up as a result of us not really having had the same numbers of slaves or the same violent opposition towards civil rights. We also don't see quite the same level of disparity between racial groups socio-economically. Our disadvantaged minorities are less disadvantaged than those of the US. 

So our universities don't really implement racial quotas quite the same way as the United States does. 

In Canada the closest thing we have to affirmative choice is universities' treatment of aboriginal students - sometimes qualifying under separate categories and getting additional funding support.

And that's contentious too, but it's not made to punish other people, it's really meant as an effort to help counteract the additional challenges faced by Aboriginal students in obtaining an education. One of the best ways to help aboriginal populations in general is to remove as many barriers to education as possible - people who are empowered and well-employed are great for their community. They're leaders and examples for youth, they're often able funnel money back into their communities for development, they're often better able to service their communities. Setting aside spots for them isn't meant to remove spots for white kids. It's not. Aboriginal students who make it to university often had to attend rougher schools on or near reserves. They're more likely to grow up in foster care. They're less likely to have university-educated parents.

Just imagine that you're a highschool student living with your paternal grandmother - a woman who attended residential school. She didn't receive a great education - she probably left the moment she was able to because residential school was a shitty time for a lot of students and they got schooling that was far below the standards set for other students. When you're raised in an environment where school is a scary, violent, abusive force it doesn't necessarily breed the same academic support.

There are all these barriers that stack up together to make it really hard for them to get into the same programs.

Aboriginal special acceptance programs aren't meant to punish poor or disadvantaged non-aboriginal kids. They're simply meant to help provide clearer avenues for aboriginal students to access education.

I think that's what affirmative action looks to do in the US. 

Affirmative action isn't perfect. You get advantaged kids in any race. But it's one of the best tools we do have for helping poor and depressed groups help themselves. Admitting their kids to universities helps them lift their communities up and that's worth the imperfections in the system.","I think there is a lot that can be said about subtle ways in which Black and Hispanic students are at a disadvantage in the admissions process, and I agree with other commenters who are making this point, but I actually want to come at this issue from a slightly different direction.   Consider the admissions process not from the perspective of the student, but from the perspective of the college.  The college's job is not to find and admit the ""best"" or ""smartest"" students, whatever that might mean, but rather to admit the students who are going to benefit the college the most.  Most admissions officers, especially at elite private schools in the U.S., will readily admit this if asked.  You can argue that this is somehow ""unfair,"" but remember that the first and most important job of a college is to maximize its own ability to do high-quality education and research.


Admitting a racially diverse student body helps the college achieve this aim in a variety of ways:

1. It helps attract a larger applicant pool.  Some students applying to college value ""diversity"" and will choose to apply to colleges with visible racial minorities preferentially over colleges that are dominated by White students.  Conversely, very few students will cross a college off their list because it is ""too diverse.""  So the college has nothing to lose and everything to gain in terms of attracting more applicants if there's more visible diversity.  Colleges would always rather have more applicants than they can admit because then they appear more selective, and thus more prestigious.

2. It keeps alumni and donors happy (who value the perception that the college is ""diverse""), who will then give the college more money which it can spend on things like increasing the quality of its programs or providing more financial aid to needy students.

3. It increases the number of student perspectives on campus, broadening the range of discourse in and out of classes and leading to a higher-quality education as students are exposed to a broader set of ideas and experiences.

4. It gives the college a broader alumni base in communities other than those dominated by Whites and/or Asians.  This helps increase the college's general name recognition and prestige. 


I should note that this approach to the admissions process is typical of private colleges and universities (and a few top-tier public universities) in the U.S.  It is much less true of large state schools and essentially nonexistent outside the U.S.  However, it is these same U.S. private colleges and universities that are most likely to use affirmative action in their decisions, so I think the point stands.",A,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a different perspective on the issue by focusing on the college's perspective in the admissions process rather than solely on the individual student's qualifications. It highlights the benefits of having a racially diverse student body for the college itself, including attracting more applicants, keeping alumni and donors happy, broadening student perspectives, and increasing the college's name recognition and prestige. By framing affirmative action as a way for colleges to maximize their own ability to provide high-quality education and research, reply B offers a compelling argument for why race-conscious admissions policies may be necessary. This approach may help the original poster see affirmative action in a different light and consider the broader implications of diversity in higher education."
predict-explain,"Lets start by looking at a situation:

Imagine you are walking by a shallow river on your way to a ball when you see a child drowning. You're wearing some pretty expensive clothes (lets say 500 pounds) that will no doubt be ruined if you jump into the river. Saving this child doesn't put you in danger as you can stand in this river while the child being smaller cannot. Do you jump into that river to save that child? 

Let's say you encounter that same river with a different child in it the next day while wearing your rolex watch. Do you jump into that river to save the child? 

Now lets look at the real world. More than 1.3 billion people live in extreme poverty (less than 80p a day) and 7.6 million children are estimated to have died before their 5th birthday in 2010. Many of these are from poverty, preventable diseases and illnesses. Money can help provide infrastructure for schools, hospitals, sanitation facilities, vaccinations etc which no doubt will help reduce child mortality rates. Once you look at the world through this lens then it is easy enough to look at the world in terms of opportunity cost. This iphone or 100 life saving vaccinations. An expensive house or cheap government housing and a new well providing water for a village. One may argue that there is a difference between the example and this and that is distance. These children are much further away but I don't see how that dilutes your moral responsibility to them. Therefore, it seems that any money that you keep must be worth a child's life, education etc or be allocated to some other duty such as child rearing where you have a responsibility to give time and money (for schools, healthcare etc) to make sure that your child grows up to be a socially productive member of society. I know that sounds like a very cold perspective on what parenting is about but i couldn't think of another way to phrase it haha.

I will assume that most people think that you should save the child but this specifically is why I would save the child. I'm looking at this from the stance of virtue ethics (Aquinas) and I believe that by allowing this child to die shows a lack of charity and isn't positively building character. I can't justify losing a life in exchange for 500 pounds.

But,  I think even taken from the stance of consequentialism (believing that consequences should inform your moral thinking) or deontological ethics (believing that laws inform your moral stance) you would still reach the eventual conclusion that you must jump into that river:

Consequentialism (i.e. Utilitarianism):
You would have to argue that having 500 pounds will lead to greater pleasure/happiness than that life and I don't think you can justify that.

Deontological ethics (i.e. Kant):
I only really understand Kant so he's the one that I will briefly (very briefly) talk about but allowing that child to die breaks the categorical imperative as if you allowed that act to become universal you would be devaluing human life by saying that it has a price tag.

I've only briefly talked about why I think the child should be saved as I take it as a assumption that most people would save the child but I will be willing to discuss my ethical stance more thoroughly if anyone asks me about it but i didn't want my post to only appeal to those who have studied philosophy.

Thanks for your answers!

Additionally, I really don't think you sufficiently dealt with Kantian ethics at all (I wasn't convinced by your account of the categorical imperative, and you ignored the other components of Kantian ethics, which I actually think make a stronger case for you, specifically the second formulation), and it seems like you misunderstood virtue ethics: it isn't about maximising behaviour that conforms with a particular virtue, it's about cultivating the virtue itself. Virtue ethics demands that you are a charitable person, not that you perform maximally charitable actions. Under an Aristotelean framework (which is essentially what Aquinas operates under), it's very easy to be *too* charitable, as well, which I think is worth considering. 

Regardless though, some common critiques of the view your espousing would be:

- It's impossible to accurately quantify 'happiness' in such a way that would allow you to make the assumptions you're making

- Ethics isn't the highest thing we should aspire to

- You have unique ethical responsibilities to people who are closer to you (i.e. that space is morally relevant)

- Utilitarianism is heavily flawed, and your argument doesn't really work for any other major school of ethics

- This position contradicts common-sense morality, which is what all moral systems aspire to emulate

Do any of those sound like they could maybe change your view?","Your argument is based on the notion that money can fix all of the problems that impoverished people face.  This is simply not true.  Sure, money can build a school, but it won't change the fact that millions of people live in a place that can barely produce food (and is losing even that ability with a changing climate).  It doesn't change the fact that the politics of many of these regions are such that any resources sent there will immediately be confiscated by warlords.

Sure, my $25 could help feed someone...if the food was actually able to get to them.  But then what?  A week from now they're back in exactly the same situation.",A,B,"I believe reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"After every school shooting the debate gun violence in schools starts up with one side supporting reduced gun rights and the other side supporting banning violent video games. Whenever the idea of posting armed guards at schools is brought up the idea is always shot down as ridiculous. It was never given a reason why people look down upon it. I feel that posting armed guards at schools would directly deincentivize any individual from going to violent crimes at schools. And if the individual wanting to commit is suicidal than the armed guards would directly solve the problem and stop the would-be gunmen before the tragedy even starts. All other ideas on curbing gun violence doesn't seem to have the aspects of deincentification and directness that posting armed guards at schools has. That's not to say that ideas are wrong but adding this idea of armed guards to their respective platforms would, in my opinion, help curb school violence better than any of these opinions could individually.

edit*: I see that most peoples points are that school shootings are rare and the expenses involved would be to great. That's a legitimate and fair argument. I still think it should be brought up for discussion but I see why people look down upon it.

Seriously man, think about what you're suggesting. 

Also, you're wrong when you say that it will discourage shooters. People who are going to shoot up a school are fucked up and illogical; do you think an armed guard is going to stop them?

""Oh well, I was going to murder 25 people today, but there's a guard and I'd just feel terrible about murdering 26....""

* **Cost** - stationing an armed guard at every school would be extremely expensive

* **Environment** - When you do something like this, it's a message to the students that not only is it possible for something to happen to them, it is likely enough to warrant hiring guards. Kids have enough stresses as it is.

The school that I went to had two or three sheriff's deputies around during the day, I think that they were called ""school resource officers"" or something.

In contrast, Reply A uses sarcasm and exaggeration to dismiss the original poster's suggestion without providing a strong counterargument. Their argument that armed guards would not deter shooters because they are ""fucked up and illogical"" is not a strong or convincing point.

predict-explain,"Disclaimer: I am very anti-theist so that's why I have such a negative thought of bringing your kids to church.

Bringing children to church starting at a young age is very likely to make that person blindly follow that religion without them having much of a choice. At a young age, kids are impressionable and tend to believe whatever an adult/parent says to them. Thus, the odds of them changing their beliefs are lowered. I am not saying that they will never switch, it's just the odds of them doing so are severely lowered.

 I believe that any church or religious meeting areas should have an age restriction (I will leave that age number up for debate). And not to make them not believe in religion, that violates the constitution. But to let them make the choice themselves, and purely by themselves. I know that the parents could just teach them about it, but hey, if some people are going to indoctrinate their child, might as well make them use their own time to do that.

predict-explain,"You may have seen news that BlackLivesMatter protesters interrupted a Bernie Sanders campaign event in Seattle.

I also think many of the things that were said by these protesters were racist or at least bigoted in their own right, like criticizing Bernie Sanders for being white. 

Why did these protesters think that this was a good thing to do? Why did they think it helps their cause?","I am going to start with the caveat that I am not trying to change your overall opinion. I am ONLY trying change your opinion on this particular segment of your reasoning: ""...this was wrong to do, *because he has fought for civil rights before and his economic platform greatly fights for the poor and working class, in which black people are disproportionately represented*."" I totally agree that Bernie Sanders has one of the better records on civil rights among the candidates who are running. However, that makes him a better target, not a worse one. It would be completely pointless to show up at a Donald Trump rally and say something about Black Lives Matter (or any racial issue). Donald Trump is a clear and overt racist. There is nothing that can be done to make Donald Trump a good candidate on race. Bernie Sanders is a relatively good candidate on race, but many people who have race as the primary political issue that they care about believe that he could be better. By targeting Sanders, who is already a relatively good candidate on race, people can put pressure on him to make race a primary element of his campaign and to refine his opinions on policies regarding racism and social justice. 

I don't know what the motivations of these women necessarily were (their message was VERY muddied by a lot of factors) and I don't think their actions were appropriate or helpful at this time. But I think the idea that Bernie Sanders should be free of criticism on racial issues specifically because he has a decent history on them is silly.

That even when ""meeting half way"" on controversial issues, ""half way"" is  only defined by the White parties.

predict-explain,"Greetings!

I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay.

However, as far as my understanding of History goes, Humanity kept uniting into bigger and bigger groups.

I'm not sure whether my order is correct, but it's merely to give an example of what I am seeing.

First, families started working together as it was easier to hunt that way  
Then, they started to form small tribal communities  
Then, these tribal communities united into alliances and ""great tribes""  
Then, the tribes became petty kingdoms  
Then, the petty kingdoms were either swallowed by a larger one, or swallowed the smaller ones.  
Then, the kingdoms they formed kept absorbing the smaller communities that were similar in culture

And then there are countries like the United States and Russia, both spanning almost entire continents or more. Likewise, they have the strongest presence as well. The United Kingdom had an equally great presence during its Imperial days, which it more or less managed to retain.

I feel Europe could easily raise its economy to the third power if each current country paid its tax to a single, central government that viewed each part of the union equally, at most... with different strategies, investiture focuses.

The main counter arguement I see against an united Europe is cultural decay or incompatibility, but I do not understand how it would get in the way too much. Culture won't disappear just because people answer to a single elected government, neither will it disappear due to people wandering within the borders.

you can't do the same for Europe where everything is completely different - money/currency, religions, general lifestyle.

it's also worth noting that having an EU passport means that you can go to those countries with no problems - so it is effectively like one large community anyway, and realistically, has no benefits in changing into an official 'mono-country' effectively.","So leaving aside the Whiggish narrative of history in the first half of your post being wrong (states do not always go from decentralized to centralized in a nice linear fashion), there's a lot of reasons why a unified Europe remains, at best, a pipe dream.

First, the economic angle. The economies of Europe are vastly different in output. Germany is an economic powerhouse. Greece can't pay its debts. Most of the rest are somewhere in the middle. So you'd need all these disparate economies to agree to pay their share of taxes, which will inevitably be unequal, as will who reaps the benefits. Germany is already unhappy about how badly they've been burnt down in Greece. Imagine if that was a yearly occurrence.

The second issue, you touched on yourself. Compatibility. In East Europe, you have countries like Poland who get very nervous when people start talking about doing things to their national sovereignty. In West Europe, you've got hatreds that run back hundreds of years. In the Balkans, I'm sure the Slavs will jump at the chance for another unified government, and the Greeks and the Turks will have no issues at all being in the same ""country"".

Finally a large unified government is going to be a bureaucratic nightmare. First, you'll encounter the West Lothian question writ large. Are the Germans going to let Greeks have an equal say in how this hypothetical government's money is spent? How about the French? Are the Irish going to be happy haggling over a budget with the English? Will the Spainards be likely to listen to the Finns when it comes down to how to divvy up the tax? The Balkans alone would be an absolute fucking nightmare. Second, you're going to have to find a way to nail all the various forms of government in Europe together into something every other country is happy with. What do you do with the British Monarchy, for instance? At election time, how are you going to convince Portugal to accept votes from Romania (whose ballet boxes may or may not be stuffed).  At least you have INTERPOL for cops, but how are you building a military here? An intelligence agency? And then you have to hold it together. A single major economic crisis was enough to threaten the EU, and if this thing disintegrates, the consequences will be much, much worse.

And all these are internal issues. They ignore the international side (how does Russia react? What about China?) of things. Unifying Europe into one central government is a morass of issues. If it happens, it will happen very, very slowly, with large amounts of not entirely unjustified resistance.",B,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

It's all well and good if we have thousands of hard drives remaining 600 years from now, each with the entirety of the GoT universe (books, TV show, lore, you name it) stored on it. However, if there aren't any computers (or other devices) available to play them back to you, those hard drives are essentially useless. To put it another way, it's like [that scene from Zoolander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2uHBhKTSe0) where they're trying to figure out how to access the files in the computer. If the files exist, then we technically have preserved them - but if we can't actually access them, then what's the point?

Part of the reason cave paintings have survived so well is because they're entirely intelligible even without any other knowledge of human culture. Monks' manuscripts from the middle ages are similar, in that they've preserved materials in a language we understand - but what happens in a thousand years where someone who has no knowledge of the English or Latin or Italian (etc.) languages or any way to get that knowledge stumbles upon those manuscripts? They'll have the really old stuff in tactile, tangible form, but they won't be able to access any of the information on it. Hard drives would be even worse - if you can't get into them and see the files stored there, they serve no purpose other than really old paperweight.

So, to answer your question: Is home recording/piracy an effective form of preservation? Sure. Is it the *most* effective, though? Absolutely not. If you really want to be able to store GoT effectively, paint the entire series on a cave wall somewhere.","&gt;At no point in history has it ever been easier to ensure archival and preservation due to digital mediums, and yet by applying copyright protections the content makers are doing nothing more than ensuring their great works might be lost to the ages.

Unlikely. Films don't take up much hard disc space by modern standardards so for the companies that hold the copyright keeping the things around has an effectively zero cost and well you never known when they might be useful.

1)Shear volume of data. Backing up the whole of youtube is tricky. The Square Kilometre Array should be able to produce about 10 petabytes of compressed data a day. I don't know about you but I don't keep petabyte hard drives about the place.

2)Non digital stuff. Some is fine. Clay tablets and Vellum can if stored correctly last pretty much forever nitrate film stock not so much. Pirates don't seem to spend much time digitalising nitrate film stock.

3)stuff that requires really specific hardware to function. MANE and MESS do their best but there are limits. Now in fairness those projects are partially piracy driven but it isn't mass piracy. Most people aren't interested in being able to run software for say an HEC2M (although I don't know if any software for that system survived) so the work tends to be done by a handful of rather obsessive people.",A,A,"I would say reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a well-thought-out argument about the limitations of relying on mass piracy for preservation, highlighting the importance of accessibility and the potential issues with storing digital files long-term. The analogy to cave paintings and manuscripts effectively drives home the point that simply having the files stored somewhere does not guarantee their preservation or accessibility in the future. Reply B, on the other hand, focuses more on refuting specific points made by the original poster without providing as strong of a counterargument about the broader implications of relying on piracy for preservation."
predict-explain,"This is fairly straightforward.  I think all real property taxes should be assessed based solely on the fair market value of the property.  It should not matter what the use of the property is, or who lives there.  If you own a plot with a value of $300,000, you should pay the same tax as any other owner of a plot valued at $300,000.

The most egregious example against this to me is [California prop 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_13_\(1978\)) which freezes property taxes when you buy a house, essentially subsidizing long-term residents at the cost of more recent arrivals.

The basic reasoning for this is twofold.  First, there's a fairness question, since the taxes you pay should be the same no matter who you are.  In the case of property taxes, they're already progressive in as much as they depend on the fair market value of an asset you own. 

Second is an efficiency issue.  Giving people tax abatements encourages them not to move (as in prop 13) or to not sell when they don't have good use for the property, such as [this woman who is being sued for failing to maintain a property she can't afford to renovate, but keeps paying the very low taxes on.](http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150817/central-harlem/owner-of-dilapidated-landmarked-harlem-home-sued-rare-move-by-city)

In the case of property taxes, they're already progressive in as much as they depend on the fair market value of an asset you own.

That's not progressive, though.  That's just linear.  Progressive would mean the amount of tax owed increases proportionately faster than the value of the property.  ""Fairness"" is a hard concept to nail down - you probably wouldn't consider a linear income tax to be fair.

&gt; Second is an efficiency issue. Giving people tax abatements encourages them not to move (as in prop 13) or to not sell when they don't have good use for the property, such as this woman who is being sued for failing to maintain a property she can't afford to renovate, but keeps paying the very low taxes on.

I think the obvious competing interest here is that you don't want to, effectively, kick people out of their long-term homes because it so happens that the housing area around them became more expensive.  What do you say to this?","&gt; In the case of property taxes, they're already progressive in as much as they depend on the fair market value of an asset you own.

That's not ""progressive."" Progressive means charging richer people more and poorer people less than they would pay given a linear scale.

A fictional example of progressive taxes: $100k property might have no tax, $200k property might have 10% tax, and  $300k property might have 40% tax.

That's progressive: you give up a more-than-linear chunk as you go up the scale.

It's a sort of socialism, redistributing proportionally more assets from those who can seemingly afford it, to those who can't.",A,A,"I would say reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a clear explanation of the difference between linear and progressive taxation, pointing out that property taxes based on fair market value are not truly progressive. This challenges the original poster's argument on fairness and efficiency. Additionally, reply A raises the important point of not wanting to force long-term residents out of their homes due to rising property values, which adds a layer of complexity to the issue that the original poster may not have considered. Overall, reply A provides a more nuanced and thoughtful response that is likely to make the original poster reconsider their viewpoint."
predict-explain,"I should caveat that I'm talking about these terms as applied to humans --  not plants, nonhuman animals, or electronic devices. 

And by ""socially-sanctioned,"" I mean a definition broadly acceptable to the PC mainstream, such that you could print it in the OpEd section of the NYT without major media or social-media backlash.

The [OED definitions](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/female), while coherent, are trans-exclusionary and therefore not socially sanctioned:

&gt;**female** *(adjective)*  Of or denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically by the production of gametes (ova) that can be fertilized by male gametes.

So maybe there's a socially-sanctioned definition of ""male"" or ""female"" which doesn't reference anatomy?  If you can think of one, you may CMV. 

Citing studies less compelling/conclusive than mythologized by redditors, you might respond that ""male"" and ""female"" refer to the innate biology of the brain, not the body.  But the studies you're thinking of identify general trends, not clear markers of a ""male brain"" vs. ""female brain.""  It would be like talking about a ""male height"" vs. ""female height.""  Not a very coherent concept.

It is simple to come up with concrete terms for sex (pure biology, and what that OED definition covers), because it refers only to what reproductive system(s), if any, one possesses.

Gender, which is what you seem to be concerned with, is based on internal awareness, and much harder to pin down. ""Male"" and ""Female"" aren't particularly useful as descriptors of gender, as it is a continuum, and these only represent two points. To use an analogy, it's like trying to define car parts as ""front wheels"" and ""rear wheels"". What is a door? A turbocharger? A chapman strut?

So, male and female have a coherent meaning, but only in terms of sex. When used as gender descriptors, they are incoherent and mostly useless.","So you're asking for a socially-accepted way of defining *male* and *female* that *doesn't* touch on biology in any way? I think the concept of gender vs. sex will help to highlight this definition.

We have socially accepted that the terms *gender* and *sex* are two different terms with different meanings. *Sex* refers to the biology. Arguments about chromosomes, sexual organs, and the like all refer to *sex.* Usually when we use the words ""male"" or ""female"" we are referring to sex.

*Gender* refers to the ""mental sex,"" the sex that a person *feels* like. This doesn't have anything to do with biology. Usually we use the words ""man"" and ""woman"" in connection to gender. 

Gender is an entirely personal and private experience. I am a man not because of my body, or my chromosomes, or the way i dress, or the way I act. I am a man *because I feel like I'm a man.*

The (increasingly) socially-accepted definition of *man* is ""a person who feels like a male."" That's it.",A,A,"I would say that Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a clear distinction between sex and gender, which is a concept that the original poster may not have fully considered. By emphasizing that gender is based on internal awareness and personal experience, Reply B offers a more nuanced and socially accepted definition of ""male"" and ""female"" that doesn't solely rely on biology. This could potentially challenge the original poster's perspective and lead them to reconsider their views on the topic."
predict-explain,"My logic is pretty simple. People who believe that someone is selfish for committing or wanting to commit suicide just because it makes those around them sad then they are actually the ones who are selfish because they'd rather someone suffer than have them end their misery and be forced to grieve their death. I think there are instances where suicide is selfish (people who have children that still rely on them) but if you have no responsibilities such as that then it could be your reasons are actually very selfless. Furthermore I think that calling people who struggle with suicidal thoughts ""selfish"" is extremely insensitive and misguided as I'd tend to believe that most people who off themselves are doing it for reasons they perceive to be for the greater good. CMV!","I would say that both are correct. The person who commits suicide and the person who expects someone who wants to commit suicide not to do it are both thinking about themselves and their own values. More importantly, their actions are chosen.

I personally think that everything people consciously choose to do is inherently selfish as they are carrying out their own whims, regardless of how their actions may or may not affect others. Because when it's all said and done even if what they did helped others and inconvenienced them it was still what they wanted to do so they were still just satisfying their own desires. And that to me is selfish, which consequently makes those who commit and those who oppose suicide selfish.","Selfish means lacking in consideration of others. *The suicide person might not be thinking of others. The person whos calling the suicider selfish though is probably thinking of other people who will be harmed by this. 

Now if it was only a family of 2 though and 1 sister wanted to commit suicide I can see how both would be selfish but that usually isnt the case.

So, whether or not someone is selfish is really about whether or not their actions/advice only benefit themselves. *Suicide people might be only thinking about themselves and therefore might be selfish.

EDIT: I realized while in discussion I cant assume the majority of suicide peoples motives. Therefore, I will simply stick with the accuser's, who are more reliable.",B,A,"I would say Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a clear definition of selfishness and how it relates to the situation of suicide. By emphasizing the lack of consideration for others in the act of suicide, Reply B presents a compelling argument that challenges the original poster's perspective on suicide being selfless. Additionally, Reply B acknowledges the complexity of the situation and considers different scenarios, showing a deeper understanding of the issue at hand.

predict-explain,"A common thing I see on many news stories, etc. is how expensive people on social assistance are to society and how we need to start taking more actions to reduce abuse on the system.

I feel this is based on misunderstandings and jealousy from the people making those suggestions and that implementing them would be more expensive, violate the government's legal and ethical obligations, and make society less enjoyable for all.

My reasoning:

* Welfare benefits are typically a lot lower than most people assume per recipient, and drug testing and administration a lot more expensive.
* Unless there is an extremely high frequency of drug users, the savings realized from removing people from the system is less than the cost of the test and the administration.
* Therefore, it will always cost taxpayers more to do this than to simply pay benefits to all that qualify.
* Drug users cut off from benefits may turn to crime to find their addictions, causing additional indirect costs in policing, healthcare, etc.
* There are also likely many legal costs do doing this as the ACLU has already challenged many states who have started drug testing.
* In states that have tried it the program has had a net cost.

predict-explain,"Hi, CMV. So, I chose to become a vegetarian about 7 years ago. I've had trouble becoming a vegan, but I do what I can.

However, recently, many of my friends have been attempting to convince me that by my own utilitarian views, neither veganism nor vegetarianism are the most moral choice, and in fact, a gluttonous amount of meat is the best for environmental, ethical, and health reasons.

So far, I've been able to counter most of the evidence offered to me either with my own evidence from trusted sources or by pointing out the lack of merit from the sources given to me (lots of comic sans blogs).

This is something I do honestly believe that, given enough evidence, I would change my view on, and it seems like a lot of people seem to think they have evidence that a diet of meat is better in some way that I might consider meaningful, and of the many that do, there's bound to be some that might actually have something worth considering, so please change my view. :)

EDIT: I should say that I'm posting this from an American viewpoint in which most of our factory farms typically don't treat animals very well. If you live in a country in which the animals are treated with respect and then eaten, that might be a different story, but that is not the situation that I am in.

You're making a moral argument where one really doesn't exist for the far, far majority of people.

Examples from the past: Hendrix, Ella, Louis Armstrong, Nirvana, The Ramones, NWA, The Pistols, Iggy Pop, Bob Marley, Metallica... Absolutely changed their genres irrevocably in addition to; possibly and even more than their popularity might suggest. 

*Edit: Did not realize I had started and abandoned another sentence in the middle of the previous one. My apologies for confusion. Should have read:*

Examples from the past: Hendrix, Ella, Louis Armstrong, Nirvana, The Ramones, NWA, The Pistols, Iggy Pop, Bob Marley, Metallica... Absolutely changed their genres irrevocably in addition to the general culture; (possibly) even more than their popularity might suggest.

Beyonce as an example would NOT fit this bill. There simply isn't anything ""new"" to her act. Her solo career is typical for a successful singer moving from group to solo etc. In other words... there isn't a ""Change"" that we can attribute to her. 

Bands that started out before 2000 would also fall outside of this since it is ""within the last 15 years""

There are also the usual songs that make it into the general consciousness in terms of jokes, references etc. But those always exist and don't signal a change in the society itself. 

Edit 2: I'm open to bands that might have formed before 2000, but didn't release an album until 2000. There are two reasons I chose this cutoff date. The first is the emergence of MP3's and the second is 9/11/2001. But I didn't want to draw attention to those ideas although a couple people did note that the former may have been the reason for the dearth of any ""big game changers"". 

Edit 3: I recognize that Marley and The Pistols are not American bands. Used them to indicate scope. 

Edit 4: For those claiming that 15 years isn't enough time... Each of the bands used as examples had made their cultural significance known within about 5-7 years of their first national exposure. (Ella, Armstrong and Marley are arguable exceptions) There is also at least one representative from each decade between 1940 and 2000 in the list.

Edit 5: I KNOW I've been slow... I'm honestly listening to at least one track from each band that people have mentioned. Sometimes to acquaint myself with them, sometimes to remember them.  

Edit 6: Kanye and Taylor Swift. I've read every argument you guys have given for them. And have yet to see a SINGLE argument that transcends what would be expected from their popularity. Being a crossover pop/country hit isn't a shift in the general culture... it's routine. Maybe if she had a crossover deathmetal/ Gospel hit and *brought both audiences together*. But to combine the two best selling genres into one act... again... isn't a change. Kanye is good at what he does. No doubt. But what does he have beyond simply selling records? Simply having a unique flow is completely normal in hip hop. What *change* has he made to the overall musical or cultural conversation? That's the question I keep asking and nobody has been able to come up with an answer that isn't at least equally attributable to somebody else who was doing it before Kanye.

Not to mention he was basically the first and only one to successfully combine punk and blues on a massive scale with songs like seven nation army and icky thump.

The Black Keys would have never become popular if not for the white stripes, who reminded people a 2 person band can work on a radio format. They then took the blues formula and brought back 70s soul, R&amp;B and delta blues influence into the ""rock single"" of modern day.

The strokes did something very similar with garage rock in NYC in the early 00s. They came on the scene when alternative, pop-punk and arena rock dominated the rock charts and turned it on its head. ""Is this it"" changed the direction of rock music and showed that you didn't need to be U2 or Blink 182 to sell records.

And that's just blues and garage rock. Not to mention what the Foo Fighters did with modern rock, what QOTSA did with stoner rock, or John Mayer did with texas blues-rock with the john mayer trio. That's all just in the world of rock music; ignoring pop, EDM, hip-hop, jazz and soul.","Eminem?

I know he technically broke out just before the new millenium, but my how the ""game has changed"".

Being white in the rap genre was a barrier he destroyed. Bringing hip-hop so far into the mainstream it has basically become pop music. Brought his icon of a persona to the silver screen with an award winning soundtrack in tow. All of this happened within the first decade of his career. I think it's safe to say he's had an enormous impact on music as a whole throughout the world. 

Iconic within genre and abroad? Check

Changed genres? Marketing? Style? Triple check.

We will look back on today's current music and remember Eminem for everything he's done. Beyond that, I think the oversaturation of the music industry that has been caused by the dawn of the internet age is the main cause of the many one hit wonders, short attention span, single-serve artists that we hear nowadays. That, along with the fact that most of the broad, accessible genres have ""all been done before"", so the innovation comes in smaller amounts and in subgenres that aren't going to have the major cultural impact that the artists of yesteryear had. I think it's a ""pre-internet vs post-internet"" battle that you are referencing in your search for finding those impactful artists. They exist, but it's impossible to stand out as much as the artists you've mentioned were able to due to their place in time and the technology that exists now.

Taylor Swift (made country popular)

Kid Rock (turned country, rock, and hip-hop into pop)

Blink-182/Green Day (started in the 90's, blew up in the 00's, making pop-punk popular)

System of a Down/Slipknot (made heavy metal popular)

Linkin Park (meshed rock and hip-hop and made it popular)

The White Stripes/The Strokes/Interpol (turned indie rock into an incredibly marketable genre)

Skrillex and Deadmau5 (will be remembered as some of the first to bring house, techno, and dubstep into the mainstream)

3. Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind. 

4. Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4). 

5. Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable. 

6. Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze. 

7. Sex. Our favorite word not only has X right in it, but the whole last 2/3 of the word sounds like saying X. Y? Nowhere to be found, unless it tags along to make something sexy. Not to mention the uses of XXX, and the fact that fairer sex is made up of X chromosomes. Y gives us baldness, hairy backs, and emotional immaturity. 

8. History. Malcolm X, not Malcolm Y. There's even ""American History X.""

9. Versatility in other areas. X can be used to show that something is crossed out, used as a check mark to indicate the choice on a form, used in cartoons to show that a person is dead, used in medicine (x-rays), used to show treasure on a map, 

10. = X. 

11. ~~No one has ever died in a state spelled with an X. Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, and Wyoming combine for 10% of the deaths in the US each year~~ I somehow came up with the 4 Y states off the top of my head and also thought there were no X states. New Mexico and Texas. 

12. If you're talking about unknown items, you always say ""X is better than Y,"" never ""Y is better than X"". 


EDIT: It worked. I was forced to rethink some of my strongest points. I still may think that X is better, but I can see that Y has its merits and can sometimes be even superior. Very clever responses in many cases, and I'm afraid I'll be banned for giving out too many deltas to people who make me rethink each point.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","In your arguments you make a lot of assumptions about what better means. For instance you presume that rarity is 'better' than versatility.  The letter Y is far more versatile than the letter X, it can be used in many more words and is flexible enough to stand in for vowels when using them makes a word look horrible.  On that basis the letter Y also has great aesthetic appeal.

You assume that consistency is better when versatility could just as easily be argued to be better.

You assume that having the word ex in sex is good, but in order to describe the magnitude of sex something exudes you need to add the y on the end (sexy).

Number 11 is just plan false as I'm sure many people die each year in Texas, and New Mexico.","1, Tonal fluidity. X has a harsher pronunciation, a quality not usually considered good. Consider languages that have harsher tones, such as German and Russian. Conversely, languages with the more fluid tones that Y has, such as French and Italian, are considered more beautiful.  

2, Utility. The purpose of language, and its constituent letters, is to be used and to be useful. A letter that can be used more often is better than a letter that cannot. Y is used in adverbs. It enables us to act with nuance. X is typically used to describe things that used to be (ex-girlfriend, for example), and keeps us locked in the past.  

3, Flexibility. While X must always be a consonant, Y is able to flexibly switch between vowel and consonant. Indeed, it is the only letter able to do so. This unique power really grants Y super-letter status. Perhaps it has other powers, such as flight, and shooting lasers out of its top two prongs.  

4, Scrabble. Here's the thing about Y: it's a get out of jail free card. Let's say you're stuck and you just can't think of a word with the letters you have. Instead of skipping a turn or taking whatever punishment scrabble has, if you have a Y, you can just pop that onto the end of so many other words. Sexy, smokey, many. The list goes on. You can't quite do that as well with X. Sexx? Smokex? Manx? Well, I guess Manx works. But still. Y is better at the job.  

5, X in Algebra. X is the first letter learned in algebra, sure. But this is because X is mysterious and untrustworthy. Some days, X is 5. Other days, X is 10. Who are you, X?! And who are the members of your Axis of Evil?!  

6, Pleasing appearance. This is one of taste, so I don't think I can change your view on this. However, perhaps you would accept a different viewpoint. The Y displays the pleasing triangle shape that women like to see in fit men. Y has a strong chest and a thin waist. Presumably, under a magnifying glass, we would be able to see Y's six-pack abs.  

7, All sex requires X. But not all sex is sexy sex.  

8, X typically highlights the more violent aspects of our history. Malcolm X, and American History X. X is mired in racism. Y is typically present in the more fun parts of our culture and society. Yoyo Ma. Yogi Bear. Yosemite Sam.  

9, You can use Y on its own in a text for a word. ""y u do dis"", as an example. You can't say ""x u do dis"". That makes no sense. X makes no sense. 

10,  :Y

11, First of all, that's not true. Plenty of people die in Texas. Not only that, Texas executes more mentally challenged people than all other Y states combined. However, we should note that Texas's barbarism puts it in good company among other countries and cities with X in them. They are typically in developing world dictatorships like China (Xian, Xiamen, Xinjiang) or in crime-ridden Brazil (Xanxere, Xapuri, Xinguara). Honorable mentions: Xaxaba, Botswana.  

12, While it is convention to say X and Y and not Y and X, that doesn't tell us which one is better, merely which one is first. Sometimes, the former is better, like Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. But sometimes the latter is better, such as Tom and Jerry. We have to decide on a case by case basis. I'm pretty sure that in this case, Y is better than X.",B,A,"I would say Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have lived/currently live there, I could not be more dead set against ever moving there. In fact, I have come to despise that place. As a quick note about the perspective I have: I'm a 3rd-year law student. I grew up in South FL, and currently live in Boston, MA. I'm not a stranger to life in a northeastern American city; maybe city life in general is not for me, although I do like Boston *much* better than New York. 

First, it's filthy. There is trash *everywhere*, the water is polluted, and the air simply does not smell clean. Being an old Northeastern city, it's filled with old buildings, many of which are in varying degrees of disrepair. It's just generally a dirty, sad place for me to be. 

It's also crowded. NYC has ~8.5 million people crammed into around 300 square miles. To walk anywhere, you must wade through a sea of drab, disheveled humanity. The public transit is packed. Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I've ever had.   

The cost of living is exorbitant, as everyone already knows. Rent alone takes up most of my friends' paychecks, and their places aren't even that nice or spacious. New Yorkers seem like they pay through the nose for a standard of living that ain't that great.

Then there's the climate. The winters are frigid and soul-crushing, complete with biting wind and extended periods of low sunlight or darkness. The summers are sweltering, and the heat only exacerbates the ever-present smell of rotting garbage. Plus, central air is apparently only for the wealthy northeasterners, because it is conspicuously scarce in most homes/apartments I've visited. 

I can't understand the allure of that city. The wealthy live comfortable lives while most everyone else pays through the nose to live wretchedly. People get an inexplicable sense of self-importance and accomplishment simply by moving there and living there for a bit, regardless of what they're doing. Maybe I'd feel accomplished too, if I paid $800/month to live in a cardboard box and resisted the temptation to commit suicide by antagonizing the psychotic, fascist police to which NYC is a home. 

TL;DR NYC is a crowded, dirty, dismal place and I cannot ever picture myself being happy there. CMV. 


Edit: I'm well aware of the shitty aspects of Boston life; to me, NYC's bads are more...well, *bad* than Boston's, that's my point. Also, inb4 ""hurr Florida has bad things about it too."" I definitely know that's true!

Edit 2: FOLKS, this post isn't about ""Boston &gt; NYC""; I'm well aware that there are bad parts about Boston too. Pointing out bad shit about other cities doesn't help make the case for NY. 

Edit 3: For everyone who keeps bitching at me about the delta I gave to u/whattodo-whattodo - READ THE FUCKING RULES. Quoting rule 4's explanation of delta: ""Please note that a delta is not a sign of 'defeat', *it is just a token of appreciation towards a user who helped tweak or reshape your opinion*. A delta =/= end of discussion"" (emphasis added). I've gotten so many replies to the effect of ""hurr, you're a law student and you gave up dat easy?"" Those people can choke on a phallus; I'm just giving credit where it's due, per the rules.

Moved in a few months ago from a small CT town and would like to provide my input as I have fallen in love with my City and Neighborhood. 

Your first point, ""It's filthy and old and in disrepair.""  Since you don't live here you may not understand that many of the buildings that look like they're in disrepair are actually some of the most hip and interesting places. For example, My office building is an old Brass Factory in Williamsburg Brooklyn and from the outside it kinda looks abandoned, but walk in and you'll see that it has a very aesthetically pleasing interior. Don't judge a book by its cover. On top of that, yes NYC is an old city, therefor it has a rich history resulting in an overwhelming appreciation and desire for vintage styles/fashion/lifestyles/art/etc.. That's why I believe Brooklyn and other parts of NYC have been deemed a Hipster hub. Old, doesn't always mean bad. For the trash, yes, there are parts that are more dirty than others, but much of the city is really clean too. I think your experience with the trash might be a bit narrow minded.  

It's crowded. Yes, yes it is and thats a beautiful thing. I always get an appreciating for the human race when I'm walking through a sea of people because it's an achievement to be able to sustain so many people in such a small area. Also, those Disheveled/drab people are also some of the smartest and most innovative people in the nation.  On top of that NYC is probably one of the most diverse and ethnically accepting cities in the world. With all these people comes exposure to new cultures, rituals, food, outlooks on life, etc. 

Cost of living is high and salaries reflect that. The average salary for a particular job in NYC is higher than other places. Rent is so expensive, but you're not paying so much to sleep in a small apartment but rather paying to be so close to all the action. There is so much to experience that if you're staying in Mon-Fri, you're not doing NYC right. 

Climate. Boston just had record snow falls and a much harsher winter than us. The heat, just comes with the north east. In the summer, it's always humid and hot. That's not just for NYC, thats everywhere. The smell of garbage can be a problem and it's most prevalent in the subway systems, where it can get uncomfortably hot, but this is mostly in the touristy areas of the city where non-residents think it's ok to liter. I've seen tourists litter waaaaayyyyy more often than residents who have an appreciation for their city. 

It seems like you're mostly describing parts of Manhattan. I invite you to come to my Neighborhood in Brooklyn. PM me when you're in the city next and I'll treat you to an immaculate cuisine and unforgettable night that you'll only be able to experience here.","I'm a native New Yorker. It's really not as smelly or dirty as you make it out to be, though it can be quite expensive if you want to live in certain areas of the city.

&gt; There is trash everywhere, the water is polluted, and the air simply does not smell clean. 

There are plenty clean and nice spots in the city. I was just at [Gentry State Park](http://cityphile.com/photo/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Gantry-State-Park-4897.jpg), where I didn't see any litter and even saw some people kayaking on the East River during sunset. I'm originally from Queens, where there are plenty of quiet, nice-smelling neighborhoods.[ Forest Hills](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Forest_Hills_Gardens,_Queens,_NY.jpg), for instance, is a pretty woodsy neighborhood with a really nice suburban area. Doesn't smell like shit. You just have to get out of Manhattan.

&gt; It's also crowded. NYC has ~8.5 million people crammed into around 300 square miles. To walk anywhere, you must wade through a sea of drab, disheveled humanity. The public transit is packed. Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I've ever had.

I'll admit, NYC can feel a bit crowded when you're on a packed train trying to commute to work, but otherwise, I've not experienced having to wade through crowds of people on a regular basis. And if I do, I wouldn't call the typical New York resident a member of ""drab, disheveled humanity"". In fact, some of us are quite good-looking and take pride in our hygiene. 

&gt; The cost of living is exorbitant.

Salaries are adjusted to the cost of living, to some small degree. But you're probably still thinking of Manhattan (and some trendy parts of Brooklyn). When you go out into the outer boroughs, rent can easily go down to 700/600/500 per month, which isn't terrible. When you weigh the cost of living in a small space to the availability of basically everything (i.e. food, nightlife, cultural institutions, people, schools, etc.), then I would say lots of people would give up a front yard to live in a place of diversity and activity.

&gt; Winters are frigid and soul-crushing.

This is undeniably true. [But hey, at least we're not Boston, whose largest snow pile just melted yesterday.](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/14/422939198/the-last-boston-snow-farm-finally-melts)",B,A,"I would say that Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a more positive and nuanced perspective on living in NYC, highlighting the cultural richness, diversity, and unique experiences that the city has to offer. The user also offers to show the original poster around their neighborhood in Brooklyn, inviting them to experience a different side of the city. On the other hand, Reply B, while also providing some counterarguments, focuses more on defending NYC against the original poster's criticisms without necessarily offering a different perspective or solution. Overall, Reply A is more persuasive in showcasing the positive aspects of living in NYC and addressing some of the original poster's concerns."
predict-explain,"Redditors main real concerns about the website were monetization and the limiting of ""free speech"" in the /r/fatpeoplehate drama. Reddit has still brought many people on board independent of Huffman to help advance the site and create revenue. Further having money and people behind him will influence Huffman and his situation is very different from when he founded Reddit.

In regards to ""free speech"" the subreddits that make Reddit the awesome website it is are all heavily moderated. The subreddits targeted were brigading other subreddits. The administration's views on hate speech won't change, they even said in their announcement that, [""If the reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/)

While there will be more communication on things like the Victoria firing Reddit is still headed in exactly the same direction. **To be clear I am perfectly content with the monitization of reddit and don't see it as a big deal.** 

Ellen Pao's hatred came from her being the face of Reddit that started the changes. People latched onto her lacking resume and questionable sexual harassment lawsuit to demonize her and transform her into everything that is wrong with Reddit. She is still working at Reddit, just not as the public face of the company.

Ellen Pao was a known quantity. She was a massively unpopular and shitty CEO. Steve Huffman is something new who at least has the *potential* to take reddit in a new direction. 

The issues that reddit has aren't with limiting free speech or monetization necessarily, but how massively poorly they were handled. Pao clearly didn't speak internet fluently and had no sense of the community of reddit. She seemed completely incapable of predicting the reaction of the community and responding appropriately. Steve, the *founder* of reddit almost undeniably understands and relates with the people and culture of reddit, and comprehends how it's people will handle certain changes. 

For example, there are ways to monetize reddit that don't suck and don't jeopardize the quality of the content. Paid AMA's, Facebook integration, autoplay videos, etc. are all things that the internet notoriously hates. It is also where I think Ellen would have gone based on her track record of thinking through a financial lens. Traditionally XYZ+ more $$$ in her eyes, so that's the path she goes down. But on a site like reddit, the consequences would be *massive* to do that, and probably result in a loss of traffic.

So the point is, Ellen Pao lacked a fundamental understanding of reddit, and it led to her being shunned by the community. Nobody felt connected to her on a personal level and she seemed like a money hungry cold person. A venture capitalist in a discrimination lawsuit is basically reddit's ideal punching bad. Pao was basically set up for failure. Steve seems to have less potential issues and would at least handle unpopular decisions more responsibly in the context of reddit/the internet.","I'd just like to leave [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Blackout2015/comments/3cik4o/inc_magazine_describes_paos_apology_as_a_madlibs/csw49ac) here which explains why lots of people dislike Ellen Pao. There is a common complaint that Ellen Pao is simply an asshole; and that is a perfectly legitimate complaint to have. There is more to the hatred of her than the decisions she made. For the lazy, the post is seen below (formatted links and formatted text not included):

------

This is Ellen Pao we are talking about. She was incredibly unprofessional. She'd just say ""fuck you"".

You all should really read the In a Trial brief on her alleged ""discrimination"" suit.

Her claims were so hilariously without merit it's amazing it went as far as it did. Not to mention that she was paid more than her male peers, warned multiple times about her behavior, didn't change her behavior, and was offered a very good severance package that she refused.

There is a reason reddit was the only place willing to hire her, and it wasn't because other firms were ""scared"" of backlash from Kliner Perkins.

Anyways, regarding Paos behavior, this is what her performance reviews said and what she said to the married guy she was screwing

Behavior page

Text message page

Then there is this article where she tried to justify her asshole behavior by saying everyone was an unprofessional asshole.

She literally made a ""resentment chart"" about everyone she hated at work. She had her own version of the Burn Book from Mean Girls
Another popular topic was ""asshole"" behavior at Kleiner Perkins.

Prompted by juror questions on her use of the phrase ""don't be an asshole"" in an e-mail to direct manager and senior partner John Doerr, Pao explained that it was a common saying at the firm, and referred to the need to show its portfolio companies respect — something, she says, the firm had issues with at times.

For example, she sat in on a meeting between two Kleiner Perkins partners and two startup founders about an potential investment. Not only did the two partners vocally declare they were passing on the investment right then and there, Pao says they started talking about finding the founders new jobs.

Also mentioned was a ""resentment chart"" that Pao had created, which listed all of the problems she had with various Kleiner Perkins executives. She said it was a personal document she had created to work through her frustrations.

""Once I wrote it down and got it out of my system, I got it out of my system,"" Pao said.

In response to a juror question asking if filing this lawsuit (instead of seeking a settlement) was a way to punish Kleiner Perkins, Pao had another brief soliloquy:

Litigation is painful and difficult. This has been three years of my life. My information is all public. My emails with my friends are public. All my emails are public. This is not a good process for resolving disputes. I wanted something meaningful so I could avoid all this. I wanted something so they couldn’t feel that women were at risk and treated unfairly. This is where we’re at because I couldn’t get them to take responsibility.

She's an extremely toxic person. she abused the system in order to try and get $$$ to cover the legal costs for her scumbag husband (who stole $144 million from the pensions of Louisiana firefIghters and police).

If people don't understand why so many of us dislike Pao, they haven't studied into the subject enough. False claims like that make it harder for individuals with real legitimate claims to get recognition. If assholes like Pao continue to abuse the system as a way to get back at bosses that had good reason to fire them it makes it more difficult for people that may have an argument they are legitimately being discriminated against to be taken seriously.

Her husband defrauded and stole from hard working public servants, and she is trying to help him. (Something blue collar workers would hate)
She abused the system set up to protect those from gender discrimination in order to further her own personal goals. She was also reportedly toxic to other females in the office. (something feminists, and SJWs should hate)

She tried to make false discrimination accusations after having a consensual affair with a married man, throwing the man under the bus. She claims to have been unfairly treated while making more money than her male peers. (something Meninists would hate)

She was extremely unprofessional and tried to get retribution against a former employer that gave her chances time and time again (something people in the executive business world would hate)

She got rid of employee negotiations because of a bullshit lie that ""women can't negotiate as well as men"" (something feminists and people in the working business world should hate)

She abused the legal system for her own personal gain (something anyone that hates frivolous lawsuits bogging down the court system should hate)

She took a site that was once centered around free speech and turned it into a censored shithole, with the ""safe space"" excuse only existing to help push it through (something many people that care about free and open debate should hate)

I could keep going on and on and on.

I've never seen someone do so many things to make themselves unlikable to so many people. Then people have the nerve to say we dislike her because she's a woman. Bullshit! We dislike her because her and her husband represent everything wrong with the business world today

TL;DR read the documents. Ellen Pao is unprofessional enough just to say ""fuck you"". She had a literal ""resentment chart"" made up about how much she hated everyone at work. It's actually impressive how many toes Pao has stepped on. It takes work to be that much of a slime bag human being.

Please remember, these are not my words. I can't perfectly speak for the OP of that post.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a well-reasoned argument focusing on the potential for Steve Huffman to take Reddit in a new direction and highlighting Ellen Pao's lack of understanding of the Reddit community. It also discusses the potential consequences of monetization strategies that could negatively impact Reddit. 

On the other hand, Reply B delves into a detailed list of personal attacks and criticisms against Ellen Pao, which may come across as overly aggressive and less focused on addressing the original poster's concerns about Reddit as a platform. While some of the points made in Reply B may be valid, the tone and approach taken may not be as effective in changing the original poster's view. 

Overall, Reply A presents a more balanced and reasoned argument that directly addresses the issues raised in the original post, making it more likely to persuade the original poster."
predict-explain,"Something I see come up a lot in music discussion threads, whether on Sputnik Music , /r/Music, or even a more niche sub like /r/PostHardcore, is that being very specific with genres is an annoying thing. This is an especially large joke in extreme metal discussions where there are multitudes of different sub-genres.

I think these are great. If you like a band with a specific sound and you want to find more bands like them your best bet is to search for bands in the same genre. Being vague or broad with genres is a great way to not find more bands like the ones you're looking for.

For example, say I like Protest the Hero and want to find more bands like them. They have a lot of influences in their style but could be chalked up into the umbrella genre of ""metal."" If I search ""metal"" I will get a *ton* of bands that sound absolutely nothing like Protest the Hero. Even narrowing it down to ""Progressive Metal"" still gets a lot of bands that aren't very similar, like Opeth. But if I search for ""Mathcore"" which is a lot more specific I can find bands that sound a lot like them.

There's no reason for the disdain of genres. No one complains about when movies get a million genre tags ([Example](http://i.gyazo.com/03027ec62e9f2efce7990a56ad3c79e2.png)) but when bands do they get annoyed and I can't see why.

I'm Brostep there), and I work a lot with electronic music.

There are two major arguments I see against being very specific with genres:

1. Not all genres are, for lack of a better word, legitimate. There are certain genres, like the ones you've listed, which are generally agreed upon - I don't think there are many people who would argue that ""mathcore"" isn't legitimate. That said, there are other genres which are invoked very often, even though many, many people have argued compellingly that their very existence is kind of stupid. Take the whole dubstep sub-branching, for example. ""Dubstep"" is generally considered to be a legit genre - it's got quite a nice foundation in the London music scene, and people have been using it properly for a while. Same arguably goes for ""brostep"" (hence my username, though it's admittedly a touch tongue-in-cheek), which has been codified by enough well-established music blogs to have its existence justified. However, the dozens of other ""-step"" genres are the kinds of genres I would argue are not good at all. People who bandy about the terms ""chillstep,"" ""liquid dubstep,"" or ""trapstep"" (or, as we've seen in a few very public examples on /r/electronicmusic, ""Flumestep"" or ""feelstep"") are typically not the kind of people who have the scene-wide knowledge or experience to codify new genres of music, although they'll inevitably spread the word regardless. Thus, even though there's nothing really new being done (for example, Clubroot, Submotion Orchestra, and Phaeleh have all been doing what's called ""chillstep"" for years before that term was ever brought up), new, completely unnecessary genres are made up.

2. Genres can be very terrifying for newbies. I know that Dev was pretty merciless when I started writing for Sput, especially since I'd been inoculated with these genres that people who'd been in the scene for more than a year or two didn't use for fairly obvious reasons, and I'm surprised I didn't stop trying to delve into electronic music then and there. There are a lot of people like me out there, too. If we're sticklers about excessive genrefication - for example, if someone tries to call a song ""drumstep"" and people berate him because it's really more just half-time drum &amp; bass - that'll scare away the people new to the general style (whether metal or electronic), meaning that a potential opportunity to find a lot of really, really cool music has been totally lost. I'm sure you've seen this in comment threads, where someone will jump in and proclaim his love for whatever the new metal subgenre du jour is and other users will jump all over him for being inexperienced, and he'll leave the site forever. If we're sticklers about genres, we'll lose a lot of potential listeners.

So, to reiterate: genres can be good. However, not all genres are good, and not all enforcing of genres is good. ""Disdain of genres"" in general is one thing (though I think you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone of serious musical experience who just wants to call everything ""metal""), disdain of nonexistent genres (not mathcore, per se, but things like moombahcore and moombahstep) is another. And, of course, if we're too zealous in enforcing these genres (for example, if a user were to yell at someone for calling TTNG rock instead of math rock), we risk the destruction of a potential fanbase.","Someone has already talked about the ""illegitimate"" children of many genres, but I'd also say that the problem extends beyond that. Not all genres are well defined which leads to confusion and people who mislabel or generally disagree with how an artist is defined within a genre. Not all subgenres are accepted by their umbrella genres. Giving very specific subgenres names gives them a clear division. It physically separates one part of the community from the rest and creates a divide that otherwise might not exist. Especially around subgenres whose meaning is contested. The amount of passion involved in such debates can be alarming.

Also, many people blanket dismiss certain subgenres because they may know one or two artists from that subgenre that they don't like. But in another circumstance, they would say ""Oh, I don't like that artist but I might like this one"".

There are really good tools out there for finding similar music these days that focus more on relationships between artists and their listeners. While I think subgenres should not be dismissed, I think people also get way too caught up in labeling and strictly defining every new trend that comes along in music. People, to an extent, stop caring about the artists so much as their specific little subset of the community. I don't think that is necessarily a good thing.",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides specific examples and arguments against being very specific with genres, such as the creation of illegitimate genres and the potential for scaring away newcomers to a genre. The user also acknowledges the benefits of genres but highlights the potential downsides of being too specific. 

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the confusion and division that can arise from poorly defined genres and subgenres. While these are valid points, Reply A delves deeper into the potential negative consequences of being overly specific with genres. Additionally, Reply A provides more concrete examples and personal experiences, making it more relatable and convincing."
predict-explain,"Before I start, I think it's important to point out that I am certainly biased. I am a vegetarian who will soon be getting a kitchen and going vegan. I'm sure my logic will be questioned by many people in real life, but I feel like if I can survive this thread then I'll be set for a while. I searched for this thread but I couldn't find something this broad.


**Background:**

To start, I'd like to reference another [CMV post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/39ymxu/cmv_if_it_is_reasonable_for_humans_to_own_animals/cs7nx2l), specifically the tiers. It also explains why rights of a lower tier cannot be taken by a higher tier simply because it's a higher tier. If you're going to use logic along those lines in your response, I ask that you skim that link first. 

* **Tier 1**: Plants
* **Tier 2**: Basic Animals (excludes insects)
* **Tier 3**: Animals with more Advanced Cognitive Function
* **Tier 4**: Humans
* **Tier 5**: Anything Above Humans

**Assumptions:**

1. A human killing killing another human is considered unethical.
2. An alien killing a human is also unethical.
3. Plants are okay to be eaten because they are not conscious, and cannot feel pain or pleasure.
4. Basic animals are conscious, and can feel pain or pleasure

**My Logic:**

If we can agree on my second assumption, then we have to accept that any code of ethics we follow cannot, without purpose, isolate rights to a single tier. So the question now becomes, If meat is not murder, then for what purpose should basic animals not be given the same right to life that a human is given? If we can agree on my third and fourth assumption then I see no reason why a basic animal should not be given the same rights to life as a human.

**What Will Change My View:**

Disproving one of my assumptions in a way that disproves my logic

If a lion eats a monkey or a hippo, by your logic it would be considered unethical. Vegans would clearly argue that humans don't have to eat meat. I would argue that one cannot make a universal ethical argument on eating meat. Humans still today, subsist on hunting for wild animals in areas where resources for cultivation are scarce. To claim that meat is murder, you would have to believe that indigenous people in the world should starve to death or be locked in prison.

If you are planning on becoming vegan because you believe meat is murder, why then would you go so far as to not consume eggs or dairy? You can go buy free range eggs pretty easily in most places these days.

I would further ask how far you plan on taking your veganism. Do you plan on using products tested on animals? Eating honey? Eating produce grown using animal fertilizer?","The way I like to see this is kinda human nature. Survival of the fittest. Eventually, animals we eat could evolve to survive and not be killed off so easily. But you shouldn't think it's wrong. So you think that we should do our best to make bears stop eating fish? Lions stop eating gazelle? We do it because it's in our nature. We are stronger and smarter than a lot of animals we eat, so we use them to live. Survival of the fittest is pretty much the only thing you need to not see eating meat as murder.",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A presents a more nuanced argument that addresses the practicalities of veganism in a world where not everyone has access to plant-based diets. It also challenges the idea that eating meat is inherently unethical by pointing out the realities of survival in certain environments. Additionally, Reply A raises valid questions about the extent to which one should take their veganism and highlights the complexities of ethical consumption beyond just meat. Overall, Reply A provides a more balanced and thought-provoking perspective that may lead the original poster to reconsider their views."
predict-explain,"Look, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out.  
  
Vietnam was essentially a communist state, due to influences from China and USSR, which were alliances (the former is debatable) of Vietnam during the war. After the war, our country has suffered multiple economic depressions, and famines due to the incompetence of our liberally named Communist Party. Granted the South Vietnam government wasn't any better, but what the U.S wanted for Vietnam was for the best.  
  
I understand that, technically the US did not wage war with our people, but stood against the spread of communism in Asia, and with our strategic location, a battle surely followed. The US did not deliberately invaded our country. And look at what they did to the world. ~~Defeated the Nazis and fascist countries~~, uplifted South Korea, Japan (which were both smaller and less resourceful than my country) to their respectable position on the world map today. And what had the sole communist party in my country done? Nothing but left our people in the struggle of a third-world country. And China is still brazenly harassing our borders and seas to this very day, just because our army is incapable of standing up for themselves.  
  
~~Please tell me if I was wrong and why the North won was a good idea.~~  
  
Edit: My view has changed. It was not simple as I thought it was. Generally it can be summarized into those points: involvement of China, motives and war crimes committed by the US, and there was no hope in the governing system. Communism has not helped our people a bit, but no one can really advocates for America either. We as a nation should look to develop our own path. Insights are still very much appreciated. And thanks for the discussions.","The North winning is by far the best scenario for the vietnam war. 

The reason for this is because you fail to factor in China. China was ballsy enough to invade an independent Vietnam that was allied with the USSR after the war. You would be crazy to think that they would allow a territoy close to their South to fall to another enemy. 

If the South started winning and legitimately invaded the North, China would most likely allow North Vietnam's leadership to die off and they would install their own leaders and probably destroy the South. I see no reason they wouldnt do this and America would be insane to intervene. The Vietnam war had relatively low casualties for the US side(even so there were protests around the US with millions of people yelling for peace), increasing that by a factor of 10 for a third world country would not do. So basically a Chinese Vietnam which would probably look like North Korea/khmer Rouge.

And in the impossible scenario where the South wins with No Chinese/Soviet intervention then Vietnam would be the same/worse. It was horribly corrupt under the South leadership(main reason so many southerners supported the North, mainly farmers but still). When the people are united and dont see ideologies as enemies but instead their fellow citizens that oppress them. Then there will be more war. This Vietnam would most likely follow the path of Iraq.

The last scenario is the US intervenes. I will not add nukes(also it's boring) because it is MAD in that scenario because both China and US had nukes. China stomps the US out of Southeast Asia easily. American public wouldnt have the stomach to lose 300k+ soldiers for an impossible war. If the US intervenes anyway then they lose hundreds of thousands of soldiers and experience an economic fall the likes of which it has never seen before. The Soviet Union has a field day and expands elsewhere like Philippines/Indonesia/Africa with almost 0 intervention.","I have nothing but admiration for the Vietnamese people. Within a span of 30 years the French were expelled, the United States was stopped from partitioning or exerting control over the country, and shortly thereafter a Chinese invasion was repelled. The Vietnamese also deposed the Khmer Rogue in Cambodia, a regime responsible for massacring millions of people.

Understandably, you look to countries that have done well out of being within the US sphere of influence, like South Korea. Remember though that the Rhee regime, which was supported by the US during the Korean war, was also responsible for massacring 100's of thousands of civilians. At the time, alignment with the great power that would exert the least influence over Vietnam (the Soviet Union) was likely the best option.

Your people have a heroic history and you should be proud of it.

""""The last time the Chinese came, they stayed a thousand years. The French are foreigners. They are weak. Colonialism is dying. The white man is finished in Asia. But if the Chinese stay now, they will never go. As for me, I prefer to sniff French shit for five years than to eat Chinese shit for the rest of my life."" — Ho Chi Minh, 1946

The same thing would have happened if Vietnam was partitioned or fell within the US sphere of influence.",A,B,"I believe Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a historical perspective on Vietnam's struggles and achievements, highlighting the resilience and determination of the Vietnamese people. It also draws parallels with other countries in the region, like South Korea, to show that alignment with the US may not always lead to favorable outcomes. Additionally, the quote from Ho Chi Minh adds a personal and emotional element to the argument.

On the other hand, Reply A focuses more on the potential consequences of different scenarios, particularly the involvement of China and the US. While it provides a detailed analysis of the geopolitical implications, it may not resonate as much with the original poster who seems to be more concerned about the well-being of their own country and people.

Overall, Reply B's emphasis on Vietnam's history and the potential consequences of different alliances is more likely to appeal to the original poster's sense of national pride and identity, making it more persuasive in changing their view."
predict-explain,"We've all heard the saying that a Jack of All Trades is a Master of None.  I'm not here to say that this is completely true and that if you are good at many things you will never be a ""master"" at some skill or aspect of your life.  

What I am willing to argue is that benefits of being a Jack of All Trades far outweighs the benefits of being a master of one or few ""trades"".

For starters, the possibility of finding the thing that truly makes you happy and satisfied in life is lessened quite significantly if your endeavors are honed into a certain subject at an early age.  The amount of time you spend on a certain skill, hobby, or whatever it may be is inversely related on the amount of time you spend on other aspects of your life.  It is my opinion that when you decide on your calling and devote yourself almost entirely to it, you miss out on other precious and interesting opportunities that your life could include otherwise.  

There is no doubt in my mind that abundant success in life is generated by the willingness to make a sacrifices for the thing that you believe that you want the most.  It is up to the individual to decide what matters to them the most.  Personally though, I think this is such a misguided approach to life that often leaves people feeling unfulfilled when they approach an advanced age.  Is ""success"" in life really that valuable to humans that they are willing to give up so much of their time to a specific task?  The need to be recognized and respected as a master of a particular aspect of life is a major driving factor of the sacrifices people make.   

A Jack of All Trades in my opinion does not mean you have to be great or even good at the things that you try once, or even do on a regular basis.  For sanity's sake though, let's just say a Jack of All Trades is ""good"" at many things and a Master is ""great"" at one thing.  When you set your focus on being great at one aspect of your life, there is the potential to backseat so many other important things in your life.  I think, perhaps, this is best explained with an example.  I have a co-worker who is one of the most vocally well-versed, decorated, and revered employees at the company at which I am employed.  I am still quite young, and I just graduated college and he is one of my mentors.  Working with him has really shown me what true mastery looks like.  However, he spends at least 60+ hours a week at work for no real reason other than the fact that he is potentially obsessed with his work.  At his age, I know for a fact he would rather be spending time with his grand kids; he doesn't view time the same way most others do, and as a result ends up leaving the office at 7 o'clock every night.   

I try not to work overtime unless we are really running behind on a project, because while I love my job, I don't feel the need to devote myself fully to the task.  As a result, I am able to focus on so much else and I am not constantly thinking about one specific thing.  The ability to detach myself from my career after I leave the office (or job site) really seems to subconsciously effect the rest of my day.  I feel more energized when I workout and I don't mind studying other things or brushing up on languages other than English.  I also get the opportunity to socialize more with friends when I leave work on time.  Having weekends off means I have the potential to do whatever I want and I can pick up new hobbies along the way.  So in short I am sacrificing the potential to be great at one thing for the potential to be good (or maybe even just experience) many other things.  

Please don't relegate this to being a work-a-holic and not being a work-a-holic.  This was purely a life example that directly relates to the topic at hand.

I am sure it is possible to be a Master of one or more things and still be good at a lot of other things, but my main point is that a Jack of All Trades is a much more interesting and fulfilling approach to life than dedication to a singular practice.         

**Edit** 
Here is the delta, thanks **AnecdotallyExtant**

&gt;I will change your view with a single diagram.
It will demonstrate that in order to become a master of one, a person must first become a Jack of all.
As an anecdotal example: I am myself somewhere right around the transition between the eighth and ninth picture in that diagram. But I am also the handiest person I know around the house. I can and regularly do fox everything in my house -- nearly worthless with cars, but the home I'm solid.
So again, to become a master of a single trade, one must first become a jack of all. Or one cannot understand his or her own trade out of context. This is why we start our educations in kindergarten and not in graduate studies. A wide, solid, strong and synthetic knowledge base is an absolute a priori necessity.
Which means that it can only follow that a master of one is superior, because it includes a thorough training in the jack of all.

predict-explain,"Headlights are mostly useful for improving the driver's vision while driving in low-light conditions and for increasing the visibility of the driver's car in low-light or foggy conditions. While stationary, the only non-malicious use of a car's headlights (I.E. other than parking the car and turning on the headlights/high beams in an attempt to confuse or blind oncoming drivers) is to light up an area for somebody on foot. However, a flashlight would be much more effective for this purpose.

With the lack of usefulness of stationary headlights in mind, cars should be designed such that the headlights turn off when the car is turned off in order to prevent the car battery from running down.

Edit: To clarify, I don't feel that this behavior needs to be the *only* way to activate headlights. I see no issue with there being an option to have the headlights on when the car is off, but I feel that the ""auto"" mode (headlights on when car is on, headlights off when car is off) should be at least as accessible as the always-on mode in all vehicles that have both.

- When the headlight switch is set to the normal mode, the lights go off when the car is turned off. This saves your battery in the most common case.

I believe this is due primarily to *hater votes*. It should be in the top 50, if not top 25, anime of all time.

Some Background

---

I am a 30-year old male product writer for the web, and I am not what most would consider an otaku or weeabo. (I prefer Korean culture, if we're comparing asking, and I don't go to cons, collect or read much Manga, or follow every anime series.) I watch anime recreationally, and consider myself a reasonable self-styled critic. I've recently watched quite a number of shows, being bored at home, and I've watched and rewatched SAO several times and am familiar with it.


---

**Why The Show Is Good**

Characters: The cast is great. Voice acting isn't overdone or underdone, and the characters all feel like people from a real world stuck in a game for a long time together. It also makes sense that they're all there.

Plot: The premise is not made of solid gold, but it's interesting enough to lend itself to greatness. If you die in the game, you die for real no quitsies. This has been done before in fiction, of course. However, SAO takes a different treatment of this premise. Normally, you would see horror, like in a show like Gantz, applied, or game aspects, such as in No Game No Life. 

SAO's goal is rather to show that a virtual world can be real and fulfilling. Its creators accomplish this by focusing not on the MMO aspects, which are limited to flavor, but rather on the interaction between strong characters and the tension of being trapped within this scary world. The story itself lends itself to a rich world, and the writers take advantage of the larger arc to fit in almost a dozen sub-arcs in 24 episodes. The show is *very* story dense for an anime; normally, a single sub-arc would take 4-6 episodes. These sub-arcs balance developing the world, fighting, and building relationships. The characters build on their strengths and flaws and often find themselves in situations partially crafted of their own making. (Example; Asuna is hard on her guild and pushy, and this results in a poor culture within the guild that causes problems as the series develops.) There are no unbelievable moments.

In the end, the heroes triumph, but it's not a boring triumph. They often sacrifice during the show and make many mistakes that weigh upon them. At the ending bar scene, you can feel the air of both relief and regret washing over all of the former players.

At the symbolic level, SAO is very symbolic of life itself. God puts us on this plant, and we don't get to leave unless we die. So we adapt to it and live in it, the same as in SAO's virtual world. This allegoric story pairs well with the show's many slice-of-life scenes, creating a very vibrant and real-seeming virtual world.

**Writing:** SAO does not waste time or words. No episode is filler, and each main character is multi-dimensional and arrives naturally in the main story arc. Characters do not break character. Villains are villains. Episodes are succinct and *excellently paced.* This show is so clean that you can eat off of it.

**Art:** The art direction is superb. Each character's outfit is suitable for their personality and status. Motion and combat is more fluid and direct as well as it was in Fate: UBW and other highly regarded similar shows. It was smoother than classic epics like Record of Lodoss War and Gurren Lagann or modern releases like Arslan. Admittedly, it probably had a bigger budget than those shows, but that shouldn't be a detracting factor at all. The only *fantasy world* anime I would give a higher regard to in art direction is Berserk, but in quality of animation, SAO crushes Berserk.

The only complaint you could make in the art department is that the show wasn't stylized enough to differentiate it from other fantasy anime.  For instance, the art direction in Kill la Kill was an incredible thematic rush of color with awesome hand-painted backgrounds. I'll grant that point, but can you name a fantasy anime with a better quality of animation offhand?

**Avoids Most Awful Anime Pitfalls:** Fanservice, chibi conversations, people falling off of park benches or turning into paper; these are the marks of an anime breaking the fourth wall and ruining suspension of disbelief for the view. In short, they're signs that an anime doesn't take itself seriously. Almost no anime of any level of notoriety, excluding comedies, uses these generic tactics.

**Arguments Against**

&gt; Overpowered Main Character

The story follows Kirito, a regular guy with some Kendo training and beta test experience in an online game. Kirito earns almost all of his levels solo and is on par with the very best fighters in the game. He starts off with an advantage due to his experience, gets full exp. for the very first boss, and grinds pretty much every day from there on out to stay on top of the curve. He clearly earns his main character slot through a number of trials instead of being handed it by the divine will of the writers, such as in every other anime ever. He is given a unique skill, eventually, which is powerful, but it's relatively balanced because it's difficult to use. His backstory and skillset are reasonable, and given that there must be a ""best"" among all the players, it makes sense that the show would follow him.

Meanwhile, in How to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, the main character is literally given a skill that says ""become overpowered against things you can't beat."" It's shit like that which makes me want to throw my laptop.

&gt; Dumb Plot Moments

In the first or second episode, another beta tester dies in Kirito's arms not because he was defeated, but because he turned down a potion. That guy was obviously a fuckin' idiot, and that scene could have been saved if he had just drank up and laid there. This is a fair criticism. Additionally, the army guild unit that marches in to fight the minotaur boss half dead is also made of retards. However, it's noted in the show that the reason they do this is because the army has been terrorizing its members. However, those deaths serve a purpose within the show and are not overtly distracting. The dumb beta guy's death serves to inspire Kirito to action and turns him into the MC. The dumb army guys are, much like the group that runs into the trap room early in the series, there to set Kirito on the right path and force him into action.

In the meantime, how will you excuse characters like Faye Valentine in one of your favorite anime, Cowboy Bebop? She's just there to be a plot instigator with a pair of giant boobs. Almost. Entirely. Fanservice. Many other very good anime have done much much worse with their cast and still rank top 50. Hell, Hajime no Ippo is fan ranked 20 on MAL, and although I won't disagree that the show is awesome, it's just following the formula of a hundred other sports anime shows like Prince of Tennis. OWARI NO SERAPH is even up there, and that show literally only has one redeeming character -- who isn't in most episodes. Hell, characters are invented out of thin air and people do dumb shit in Game of Thrones every other episode. Are you really going to say that SAO's weak point is a few serviceable plot blunders and side characters that didn't think through some obvious mistakes?

&gt; You didn't like the ending

The ending probably irked a few of people because it was so sudden. However, that's really the magic of the series. It's a virtual world controlled by a nutty, manipulative scientist-god whose purposes are unknown. That's the driving mystery behind every episode. Why are they even there? Why is the NPC planted in the guild as the final boss? Why is the psychologist AI disabled?

Without that underlying tension, the series doesn't take shape. The story is about human actors making intense decisions, and the elusive creator adds another layer to the conflict. It makes the story feel bigger than it is and every victory seem hollow. This in turn allows our main characters to keep driving forward.

Plus, they've already put in so many boss fights. I thought the defeat of the technically invincible guild leader was an awesome way to end, although it's obviously hedging a sequel.

I'm tired of typing, so I won't bore you with more examples. Although I really wish they had done much more with the sequels, I believe the original series ranks among the best-produced, best scripted, cleanest, most heartfelt Anime of all time. I look forward to your spirited replies.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","I thought SAO was fairly enjoyable and I quite liked the first 3 or so episodes, but ""one of the best of all time"" is a high bar to set.  So I'll add to your arguments against to explain why I think the story is weak (I'd do a con of your writing pro but my issue has nothing to do with the pacing).

Essentially pretty much every piece of major plot tension is resolved simply through Deus Ex Machina (sometimes literally), random powerups, or just magic ""power of friendship / love"" nonsense.  Nothing really feels like it is resolved by the characters, it's always some weak plot device.

* Boss fight giving them trouble? Oh Kirito will just pull out a random sword move that has never before been seen.  With a skill set that was literally handed to him by the machine.

* Confronted by player killers? Ha, of course Kirito is literally immune to any danger they pose.

* Kirito paralyzed? Oh look Asuna, magically appears out of nowhere just in time.

* Boss monster even Kirito can't defeat? Good thing the daughter that showed up the previous episode is an immortal object.

* Oh no, Yui is being deleted?  Don't worry, Kirito can instantly ""hack the gibson"" on a terminal he just found out existed 30 seconds ago to save her as an in-game item.

* Kirito losing the final duel? Asuna magically breaks the paralysis.  (Even the BBG notes how silly this is.)

* Kirito goes on to lose the final duel? Eh, no matter, he can phase back in and get one last jab in, which happens to completely drain the BBG's health despite the long established damage rules.

* Oh but Kirito lost Asuna?  No worries, she alone gets to be the only non-clearing player to be defeated but not executed by the NerveGear.

It's a long list for a run of just 25 episodes, and it burns out all the tension in the story.  Basically, nothing after ""The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" can get the viewer excited because *of course* some random thing is going to happen to save the day.  The end result is that even the ending duel, in which the viewer sees the two main characters *die* is ruined because by that point the viewer should know deep down that *of course* some random bs is going to win the day.","I only watched about ten episodes, so maybe my main critique becomes unfounded later on but from what I've heard I don't think that's the case. 


As far as I'm concerned SAO is a decent show. Great fight scenes, good music, good production values. A good popcorn show but it doesn't do anything really unique or really make you think. Doesn't make it a bad show but it certainly isn't some unparalleled masterpiece. 



Kirito is what drags the show down in my opinion. He is such a boring, lazy, utter wish-fulfillment character. He has virtually no flaws and can easily overcome every situation he's in whether it's because he's a really high level player or through sheer plot device 'power of the human spirit' bullshit as in the fight with the game's programmer. He's a super-cool 'lone wolf' badass, but also a super nice guy who will go out of his way to help people, and also every girl he meets will almost inexplicably fall in love him just by being in his presence and regardless of how kickass they were before they all go weak in the knees and suddenly can't do anything without their fucking boyfriend. 



It's not a bad show in my opinion, but it doesn't do anything that spectacular. Setting the 'golden oldies' aside, I'd say a much better candidate for one of the best anime ever would be *Baccano!* There's a show that stands out with an interesting premise and a fantastic execution that makes it a goddamn masterpiece of storytelling.",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides specific examples and explanations of why Sword Art Online may not be as great as the original poster believes. The detailed breakdown of how major plot points are resolved through weak plot devices, deus ex machina, and random power-ups highlights the flaws in the storytelling and character development of SAO. Additionally, the examples given in Reply A are more concrete and specific, making the argument more compelling and likely to make the original poster reconsider their view on the show."
predict-explain,"I was only able to find one other thread about this topic, and it was kind of a train wreck.

Common arguments:

* ""It's not Jraphics Interchange Format"" by that logic, NASA would be pronounced Nay-sa and SCUBA would be pronounced Scuh-buh. Acronyms that are not initialisms are pronounced like they are words of their own, which brings me to point 2:

* ""It's pronounced like 'gift' because that's the only other word with 'gif'!"" by that logic, due to the existence of the word 'girth', 'giraffe' would be pronounced with a hard g. 'Gift' is the exception not the rule. See; [here](http://www.theschoolhouse.us/lessons/lesson53.html). To base the pronunciation of a word on an exception is highly illogical.

* ""The dictionary says both pronunciations are fine!"" The dictionary also says that 'literally' means both literally and not literally. See; [here](http://theweek.com/articles/466957/how-wrong-definition-literally-sneaked-into-dictionary). This is because the dictionary typically reflects how words are used, not what is correct. So if people started pronouncing epitome like its spelled, the dictionary would also likely say that the incorrect pronunciation is fine there, too. This does not, however, make the pronunciation correct.

So without further ado, Change My View!

Edit: For future commenters, I will be arguing only at the grammatical level from here on out, as I have seen the same arguments from a common usage standpoint enough, and have already awarded several deltas in that category.","i mean the person who made .gif has said it's pronounced jif but that's the thing isn't it? jif is pronounced jif. we already have a spelling for that sound that brooks no arguments so it makes more sense for gif to be a different sound (with a hard g)

if you wanted to spell gif as in gift how else would you spell it? an italian would write ghif to be fair, but i think most people would just write gif

gi- having a j sound is a rule in romance languages. giraffe in italian is giraffa. our word for giraffe is based on this and so follows the same rules. the words that aren't based off romance languages follow different rules (these are the ones like gift and girth) and we didn't get .gif from italy so why should we use italian pronunciation for it? 

(note i'm using italian and not french/spanish in my examples because i'm familiar with italian. french/spanish may have different pronunciations (i forget tbh) but there is a separate gi- sound as opposed to ga- (or go- or gu-) in each of the languages)","Language is one debate that is not exclusively grounded in structure.  The *English* language slaps structure in the face and laughs.

The pronunciation or acceptance of a new word just come down to use.  How many people say one *vs* how many say another.  While the original, intended pronunciation for the word by it's creator was jiff the average person interprets it as gift minus t.  We *could* argue the *why* of it, but it is moot.  Once the word is used that way in mass, it is accepted into the dictionary and becomes correct - whether it was that way or not previously.

Keep in mind that the function that language serves is to communicate more easily.  If rules conflict with that priority, they hurt the language.  Rules are instead made to *help* that agenda. So if people are naturally inclined to pronounce something one way, it would be counterproductive to enforce the opposite.",B,A,"I would say Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a detailed explanation of the linguistic rules and patterns that support the pronunciation of ""gif"" with a hard g sound. The user also makes a compelling argument about the origin of the word and how it should follow the rules of the language it is derived from. This logical and structured argument may be more persuasive to the original poster, who seems to be looking for a grammatical justification for the pronunciation of ""gif"". 

Reply B, on the other hand, focuses more on the practicality and evolution of language, arguing that the pronunciation of a word is ultimately determined by common usage and communication. While this is a valid point, it may not address the original poster's specific concerns about the grammatical reasons behind the pronunciation of ""gif"". 

Overall, Reply A provides a more comprehensive and detailed argument that is more likely to resonate with the original poster's criteria for changing their view."
predict-explain,"Hey,

So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about.... this just doesn't make any sense to me. 

It seems to me that if we could view all orbiting matter on a single plane the size of even the earth's crust it would be very clear that space debris is not an immediate issue. The amount of debris relative to the size of the area is not that much... not even taking into account that it isn't happening on a plane but in 3-D space.

Why is this wrong with this? I guess this doesn't take into account gravity (the gravitational pull of a satellite may be substantial at orbit - making collision highly likely). Or perhaps the scale of damage even a bolt could have.. but these to me seem so remote....

Over the next, 20 years we will launch a lot more satellites - but only/maybe then they may become an issue - but at the present time it's like talking about not getting in your car because you are worried about drunk drivers - it may be acceptable but it is not rational

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","I think the issue is that 1) Satellites orbit at a specific altitude, and 2) space debris covers a much larger area/volume than you'd expect, seeing as tiny particles whizzing around at incredible speeds can do a lot of damage to delicate instruments.

Check out [this](http://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2012/oct/04/astronomy-space) article for more information. It uses the ISS as an example; the ISS has had to make maneuvers to dodge space debris. When objects in space are hit by debris, they themselves shatter into debris, causing a chain reaction. It is very feasible that with enough debris in a particular altitude zone above our planet, we will no longer be able to launch rockets/probes to other planets, and we will have much less room for satellites (assuming they can only orbit at specific heights).","There are a few things which are concerning with orbital debris.

First though, a little primer on orbital mechanics.

Your velocity and your orbit are the same thing.  If you give me the velocity (that is speed+direction) and location of a spacecraft at a single point, I can tell you its orbital path.^1

Second, there are certain orbital ""sweet spots"" which are beneficial for various reasons.  One of the most beneficial (and most crowded) is geostationary orbit.  Geostationary orbit is where your orbit matches Earth's rotation such that the satellite appears to always be at the same place in the sky.  It's great for communication satellites.

Geostationary orbit is a single circular ring around Earth.  It's at the equator, about 36000 km from Earth's surface.  It's not a plane, or a 3-dimensional space, it's a single line.

Ok, so why is this a concern:

First, things in orbit move very, very fast.  When I said that velocity tells me your orbit, I didn't give an idea of how fast these velocities are.  The Space Station for instance is travelling at about 27,600 kph relative to Earth's surface.  That's crazy fast.  If you were listening to the song [about walking 1000 miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ4Ib-7fJqY) on the ISS, you would have traveled a thousand miles by the end.^2

At those speeds, an impact is absolutely devastating.  We're talking multiple times faster than speeding bullets.  

Also, orbits need constant maintenance.  Due to the gravity of the Sun and Moon, anything in orbit is constantly being tugged around and pushed to different orbital paths.  This means that debris which can no longer be controlled will not just stay put, but possibly come intersect with orbits we want to use.

Satellites in active use are tweaking their orbits constantly to keep where they need to be.  When they get to the end of their useful life, they're generally either sent to burn up in Earth's atmosphere, or to a very high orbit to be out of the way.

The nightmare scenario is a single impact between two larger objects causing a lot of uncontrolled debris though.  It would be too small to see where it is, or predict where it will go, but yes, a bolt or a scrap of solar panel can completely wreck a large spacecraft.

predict-explain,"The U.S. Constitution is an old document. At the time it was written, it made a lot of sense, and it was a large jump ahead for democracy, politics, and the human condition as a whole.

Unfortunately, failure to foresee that conditions in the future might warrant a radically different document means that the Constitution enshrines certain rights that make no sense in the modern day, and can indeed be harmful to the fabric of society, while ignoring others that are now far more relevant. The Constitution depends on there being nearly no nuance in the rights it affords, something that may have worked better in a simpler, less complex, and crucially, less populous nation. 

The problem is compounded by the fact that making substantial changes to the document is difficult, if not to say nearly impossible in any but the best of circumstances.

Those combined factors mean that the U.S. may, slowly but surely, become backward compared to other countries with modern founding documents and laws. The solutions are apparent, and in some cases have been tested successfully in other countries, but the Constitution makes change insubstantial  and insufficient if changes come at all.

First off:

&gt;The problem is compounded by the fact that making substantial changes to the document is difficult, if not to say nearly impossible in any but the best of circumstances.

There are a few points to unpack here. 

1. It is certainly not impossible, we have proven that 17 or 27 times, depending on how you view the Bill of Rights. Furthermore it was replacing a system, the Articles of Confederation, that was *practically impossible* to change.  

2. Next the Constitutions *should be hard to change*, as someone pointed out this is not the tax code. This is a document that provides both the underlying structural setup of our governmental system **and** codifies the ideals of nation into law. There should be a damn high barrier of entry to be a part of it. 

3. In addition, our system of government was designed to be slow, to make people think about the laws that were being passed. It's not a bug, its a feature.

4. Putting those together I would like to point out that the ratification system seems a good compromise to me. We don't want a system where a simple majority is enough any more then we want a couple states to hold us back. This says we need to show a much larger interest in it as a country. 

5. Easy Amendments take away from the Supreme Courts ability to make rulings. Part of what makes them powerful is that it is not simple to change the document, and that to do so requires near unanimous dislike and outrage. A strong court is good for the people be court is actually the best at reflecting the will of the people([weird](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2087255) I know, but [true](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/ten-miles-square/2013/06/how_the_supreme_court_responds045541.php)). 

&gt;Those combined factors mean that the U.S. may, slowly but surely, become backward compared to other countries with modern founding documents and laws. 

Please name a few. Honestly I am concerned by the fact other countries take a weak stance on Freedom of Speech. To the point where the Legislature had to pass the SPEECH Act. The abuses these ""modern"" countries allow concern me greatly. I would much rather our ""backward"" system. 

&gt;Unfortunately, failure to foresee that conditions in the future might warrant a radically different document means that the Constitution enshrines certain rights that make no sense in the modern day, and can indeed be harmful to the fabric of society, while ignoring others that are now far more relevant. 

Once again, be specific. I find this comments the most concerning because the are usually doused in uneven application of the rules and critical misunderstanding system. If your going to make these claims, don't hide behind ambiguity, tell us what you think these mismanaged rights are.","The constitution is certainly flawed, but allowing amendments to be passed more easily would by no means fix it. The biggest barrier to improving our system is the *social* view of it as an immutable, timeless document (not at all what the Founding Fathers intended it to be). Were there at some point in history massive consensus that the Senate should be abolished, but only just under the 3/4-states limit, that would have been noticed, but such a consensus has never been there, only to be thwarted by the supermajority. Even if it were, changing the supreme law of the land is something for which is reasonable to expect a supermajority. These are rules beyond ordinary laws, rules which affect every person and state within our borders, and 51% of the country should not be able to make such huge changes.

Think about it from the other perspective as well. We have such a flawed system, how much worse would it be if those in positions of power could change it to their benefit with relative ease?

The major problems in the Constitution are not simple fixes that most amendments would cover, or that a lower-barrier-to-entry system to facilitate the changing of. IMO, the whole Senate can go. Maybe replace it with a proportional body. The increased feasibility in your model depends heavily on *how* amendments are made easier, and even then, the greatest barrier will be getting the public on board to make such a sweeping change. If you can't get enough of the public for a supermajority on board, as far as I'm concerned there is not enough consensus to ethically move forward anyway.",B,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a detailed response to the points made by the original poster, breaking down the reasons why the Constitution is difficult to change and why it should be that way. The user also challenges the original poster to provide specific examples of rights that are harmful in the modern day, which prompts further discussion and analysis. Additionally, reply A brings up the potential consequences of making it easier to pass amendments, highlighting the importance of maintaining a high standard for changing the supreme law of the land. 

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the social view of the Constitution as an immutable document and the potential consequences of allowing easier amendments. While these points are valid, reply B does not directly address the specific arguments made by the original poster or provide as much depth in its response. 

Overall, reply A presents a more thorough and compelling argument that is likely to challenge the original poster's views and prompt further consideration."
predict-explain,"Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France seven times by taking EPO and--when a test for EPO was developed--by taking blood transfusions during the race to increase his red blood-cell levels. He passed all of the blood tests (shy one, where the story of using a particular ointment for saddle-sores was concocted to explain it).

Doping in one form or another is always going to happen, and there will always be another method that can escape detection. If you're a professional athlete, or an amateur competing in high profile tournaments such as the Olympics, then you either dope or you face a significant disadvantage.

I don't think this will ever change, and the consequence is that every winner will be tainted by doubt, so I think the only way to address this is to change the policy to allow specific types of doping.

Ball-shrinking, liver wrecking, life endangering drugs would still be banned for the safety of the athlete, but anything that's either harmless (blood transfusions), or at the same level as ""professional hazard"" (like brain damage for boxers), would be allowed.

One of the things that encourage me to have this view, and that I'd like addressed if it's wrong, is my understanding that the IOC relaxed their criteria for gender verification. 

The reason, as I understand it, is that there were simply too many legitimate side cases, so the hardline rule couldn't be enforced. Someone genetically male might have Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome or XX/XXY mosaicism, for example, and grow up looking like a woman to anyone but a gene lab.

&gt; One form of gender identification, which was mandated for all female olympic athletes by the International Olympic Committee in 1992, tested for the presence of the SRY gene, which is found on the Y-chromosome, to identify males potentially disguised as females. This method of testing was later abolished, as it was shown to be inconclusive in identifying maleness.

Once everyone is doing it, then it's a disadvantage just to get even competition.
Many performance enhancers have significant health risks/side effects.

Why bother doing it when you don't even get an advantage anymore? 

It's easier and healthier for everyone to ban it.","I think your premise that blood transfusions are safe is your biggest fallacy. When preformed by a medical professional, transfusions are very safe. However, when professional organizations do not forbid them they are tacitly endorsing them. This may not be a problem for the professionals who can afford medical professionals and sterile materials, but the kids who are trying to get to that professional level will almost certainly NOT have access to those benefits. They are the ones who will be forced to take risks.   
  
And your argument that it's going to happen anyway so we should not ban it is logically inconsistent. That is like saying people are going to steal cars, so we shouldn't have a law forbidding it. Just because some people do not obey the rules is not an argument that they shouldn't exist. In addition, those people violating the rules take on the additional risk of getting caught. Lance Armstrong is a prime example.",B,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B addresses the safety concerns of allowing doping, specifically highlighting the potential risks for younger athletes who may not have access to the same resources as professionals. By pointing out the potential harm that could come from allowing doping, Reply B effectively argues against the original poster's suggestion to allow specific types of doping.

Additionally, Reply B effectively counters the original poster's argument that doping will happen regardless, by comparing it to the idea of not having laws against stealing cars. This analogy helps to illustrate that just because something may happen, it doesn't mean it should be allowed. Bringing up the example of Lance Armstrong also serves as a real-world example of the consequences of doping.

Overall, Reply B provides a more comprehensive and logical argument against allowing doping, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"Linux is a hard to learn OS and seems daunting for the average Windows user. Many things on Windows cannot be used on Linux (Distros I have tried were Mint and Ubuntu).

1. Gaming. Games such as ARMA 3 or any other DirectX 11 games cannot be played on Linux at all. In fact, Steam refuses to download them. Even some directx 9 games cannot be played using Wine. (personal issues were splinter cell, battlefield (any of them), and SWBF2 to name a few.) 

2. Ease of use. Whenever I try to look up how to do something on Linux it always involves the terminal and confusing commands. With Windows, everything has a easy to use interface. Compared to Windows, Linux is not as polished and requires a lot of setup to easily use. 
Many technologically challenged people have no idea how to use the terminal, especially without Google's help.

3. Drivers. I applaud Linux for its ability to easily recognize system drivers (chipset, USB stuff, etc) but when it comes to things such as joysticks and gaming controllers, even Nvidia drivers and other special drivers (ps3 eye webcam), the terminal has to be used with varying degrees of success. 

4. Applications. Almost every program is Windows only and has no alternative in Linux. Some examples are anything GPU/gaming related, (MSI afterburner, geforce experience, etc.) fan control, temp monitors, and any program that has an exe at the end.
 
In short, the excessive use of the terminal combined with the lack of common programs/drivers make Linux unusable for both the everyday consumer and the gamer.

I am completely willing to change my view, as I have tried Linux many times with the same common issues appearing. I just see no benefit Linux has over Windows, besides being free.

That's one major reason I'm a fan of free market systems -- different people have different needs and goals and should be able to choose the option that works best for them even if someone else who has a bigger gun than you might not agree. But it's sweet to know that Linux is available if you ever run into a situation where Windows messes up in a big way and you need to use another option for a while.,"I'm going to stretch the CMV just a little to leave out the word ""desktop"", and make a case for why you might need ""Linux"".

First of all, there is a good chance that you are actually already using Linux. If you have a TiVo, or an android phone, or certain internet routers then you are already using a Linux powered device every day. Linux is used to drive some calculators, smart TVs, automobile control systems, and home appliances. 

Linux is low cost, secure, stable, and customizable. Many devices would be prohibitively expensive or unworkable without Linux. 

And while you personally might not be using it to run your desktop, the mere fact that it exists keeps Microsoft from having a complete monopoly. If you ever find yourself completely disgusted with Microsoft for some reason, you have another option available to you.",B,A,"I would say that reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a broader perspective on the use of Linux beyond just desktop operating systems, highlighting its presence in various everyday devices. It also emphasizes the importance of having an alternative to Microsoft, which could resonate with the original poster if they ever become dissatisfied with Windows. Overall, reply B presents a more compelling case for the value of Linux beyond just the issues raised by the original poster."
predict-explain,"While I agree with a lot of what Bernie says on principal and would more then welcome him as my presidential candidate, he simply does not have what it takes to win the Democratic nomination for a myriad of reasons:

The only people who have a vested interest in him are college students and certain areas of the internet. No one seems to be addressing this huge discrepancy either, making the whole thing reek of another ""Ron-volution"".

I remember in my class a few months back a straw pole my professor conducted an informal poll of who was going to voting for who and why. Almost unanimously (professor included) were in favor of voting for Hilary on the sole qualification that she was a woman and that would be good simply because it would signal to other women that they could have a career in politics. I don't necessarily agree with this mentality, but you can't argue that a lot of people will vote for her for that reason simply because of that ""progressive"" position.

(4) Even if Hilary gaffes and scandals her way out of the nomination and hands it to Bernie on a silver platter, Republicans are going to have a field day turning this into a shit show. Mud will be slung at the Radical Vermont Socialist who'll just continue Obama's policies. Corporate interests will pile the money on. The Baby Boomers will come out in full force and vote for whoever the GOP will push out simply out of fear. A good chunk of Americans don't believe in global climate change, how in the hell are they going to vote for a socialist?

I will admit that my opinion is incredibly jaded. I will also admit once more that I really want to see Bernie win, but I just can't imagine a universe where that happens.

Edit: There has been a lot of great debate over the last 12 hours about this issue. Ultimately, I can't count this as fully persuaded/""Bernie is going to win the nomination and take the White House."" However, the never has changed to an itty bitty maybe baby.

This is almost always the case at this point in the election season; the only reason it appears to be more pronounced now is that you're contrasting his name recognition with Hillary's. Do you think people knew who John Kerry was? And yet even at this point, before everyone has announced their run, and before any debates, Bernie's support has grown dramatically. It's too early to say that he can't get his name recognition to the point where it needs to be.

Hilary has the advantage here as a former Secretary of State. If something happens between now and the election, it would only further her lead.

First of all, I think you're dead wrong about the focus. Most debates are about domestic policy, because that is the policy that affects most Americans, and despite the upturn in the economy, it's still pretty bad; furthermore, it's not just whether the economy is ""good"" or ""bad,"" but specifically what Americans are pissed about, struggling with, etc., and when it comes to income inequality, saving Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, taxing corporations and the wealthy, student debt, workers' rights, money in politics, and other related topics, Bernie has more credibility and, if nothing else, more exciting positions than Hillary.

As far as foreign policy goes, she may have an advantage, but Bernie taps into the large swath of the Democratic Party (and Republican Party) that thinks we should stay out of the Middle East and let them deal with their own problems. Anyone who thinks in that way will be fine with Bernie not having been Secretary of State; add to that the fact that he's the head of the Veteran's Affairs Committee, and he'll have plenty to say.

Some might, but [polls thus far don't show much of an advantage for her with women](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/07/10/1400974/-Bernie-Sanders-Breaks-20-in-a-National-Poll-for-the-First-Time-Gaining-Support-Across-Demographics). His ""problem"" right now is mainly with 45-54 yr olds and African Americans, and that could have a lot to do with name recognition.

&gt;Republicans are going to have a field day turning this into a shit show. Mud will be slung at the Radical Vermont Socialist who'll just continue Obama's policies. 

Of course mud will be slung, but do you not think they have mud on Hillary? Her favorability numbers have *plunged* since the GOP began going after her, and they've got *decades* worth of material to use on her. What have they got on Bernie? He's a self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist. But they already kind of used up the socialist thing on Obama, and it didn't work. The American people heard that Obama's policies are socialism and said, ""If so, I don't mind socialism."" Granted, Bernie doesn't deny the socialist influence, but the policies of a Democratic Socialist country are not much radically different than our current system. Bernie just wants more government assistance for the poor, and less government assistance for billionaires. He's not trying to abolish capitalism. There will be mud slung, but he isn't afraid of his positions, and when people hear his positions, they tend to like them. Will he win the presidency? With this field of losers on the GOP side, I wouldn't count him out, but it's still too far out to guess: if I had to guess, I'd say no. But does he have a chance? Absolutely. He speaks in much the same way Obama spoke, and Obama was elected based on that rhetoric. He speaks in much the same way that FDR spoke, and FDR was our most popular president in history.

**tl;dr** Without being a fanboy, you can admit that he has a chance.","&gt; (1) Huge swaths of Democratic blocs have little-to-no idea who he is.

That is okay at the moment.  His current goal is to recruit the activists who will help him organize volunteer campaigners in key primary states. In a half a year it will matter if most primary voters know who he is and in a year it will matter if most voters know who he is, but it doesn't matter if most people don't know who he is yet.

&gt; (2) Our economic problems aren't behind us by any stretch of the imagination, but we are slowly recovering and the media seems to be shifting its focus toward international affairs such as ISIL and Russia. Hilary has the advantage here as a former Secretary of State.

It is mainly the upper class that is recovering. Wages for most Americans aren't keeping pace and people absolutely do care about that. Sanders is a smart guy and has been in the Senate long enough to do better on foreign policy than most of the GOP candidates who primarily have experience at the state level.

&gt; (3) This one is a bit shaky, kinda sexist, and based on personal antidotes, but here it is. Mrs. Clinton is a woman.

I think that gives Clinton a bit of an advantage, but if you compare Sanders' policies to those of the GOP, Sanders' is much more aligned with centrist and liberal women's values.

A good chunk of Americans don't believe in global climate change, how in the hell are they going to vote for a socialist?

It really doesn't matter how liberal the Democratic candidate is, *Republicans will do that anyway!!!!*  Sanders will have to clearly tell Americans what his policies and values are to combat the ""socialism is bad"" meme, but he has started doing a pretty good job of that.  For Sanders to have a chance he will need to have a large Obama-style group of volunteers to help get his message out, but he is on track to get those people. His biggest obstacle at the moment is that people like you who support him worry that he isn't a realistic candidate. If all the supporters like you were willing to spend a little bit of time helping get his ideas out he would be in very good shape to win the election.",B,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"First of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that even many of the violent criminals who are jailed don't need to be locked up for as long to prevent them from being an immediate or persistent threat. In fact, I believe that long term incarceration under harsh conditions is something which actually causes further social harm – directly to the person incarcerated and to the society which the prisoner will be released into after an extended period of incarceration. Also, if the person has dependents, they too might suffer more if their material needs are not adequately provided for.

Subsequently, if some sort of punishment is required for violating some sort of socially accepted institution, then I feel that some form of shaming, shunning, and exile are possibly effective alternatives to prevent crime before we decide to incarcerate someone for an extended period of time or issue fines which they may not be able to pay.

One advantage to this approach is that the punishment is more directly democratic. It's not a punishment which is wholly issued by a sitting judge who is appointed to represent the public and who arbitrarily decides a perpetrator's fate. Rather, the perpetrator, by agreeing to make public their offense, can still receive a certain degree of sympathy and forgiveness. And if they are shunned or exiled (for some indeterminate amount of time), then other members of the public can go along with that punishment to a degree they see fit.

Granted, with shunning or exile the punishment would work much better with social cohesion, but if it were the accepted form of punishment then shunning or exile might be more readily accepted and enforced by the general population of an area. Admittedly, this is an aspect of society which would probably have to be reformed or evolve if a society chose to move away from incarceration, corporal punishment, and excessive fines. But if society is incapable of changing in this way... then I'm not sure society would be able to change in other ways which would make it sustainable and tolerable to live within.

Your family might have shunned/disowned you, you will have lost contact with your friend and you don't have a job. It is very hard to get a new job, because of your status as a convict.

This is the reason why many ex-convicts fall back in to a live of crime. 

Your system skips the prison part, which is nice, but it might drop you in a place where you are unable to enjoy your life or contribute to society.

It would be better if after serving their prison sentences ex-convicts are accepted back into society, so they can rehabilitate.

Obviously the war on drugs is ridiculous and people shouldn't go to jail for victimless crimes. We should fix these problems instead of trying to find a workaround.","I don't see how this solves any of the problems with the prison system, besides the costs. It doesn't protect society, because you're just putting them somewhere. Dumping your problem onto another country is not a solution to the problem. It doesn't rehabilitate them at all if they're not getting any help. It doesn't sound particularly humane, and it doesn't help the people who are wrongly accused. 

Plus, I would definitely not trust the general public with dealing out punishments. The public will hurl abuse and hatred at anyone they decide is guilty, regardless of how much evidence there is for their guilt. Think of all the hate Oscar Pistorius got without the public even knowing if he was guilty.

predict-explain,"First, I know ""egalitarian"" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word ""feminism"" has, but I feel like it's time for a change. 

The internet has caused a lot of voices that may otherwise be drowned out come to the forefront, such as the feminist extremists (or ""feminazis"" if you will). It seems that because of this many people are being turned off by the idea of feminism (myself included) because they associate that word with the people that blame all of life's problems on the patriarchy. 

My friends are starting to joke about feminism and I see more people mocking it every day. I believe it is due to the extremists, and how polarizing and antagonistic a lot of their views are. This stubbornness to stick to the name is causing a lot of people to dismiss, or even despise, the movement and is hurting it's support. I feel that if true feminists were willing to distance themselves from the ""feminazis"" it would stop a lot of animosity people have towards them. 

This might end up being as simple as calling it something different, because maybe the only ones that would keep the term ""feminism"" would be the extremists. They might want to retain the name so as to not give in or lose the fight. Of course there is no way of telling, and they may very well go along with the ""true feminists"" and call themselves egalitarian anyways. 

In either case, I feel like it would be beneficial to cause a clear divide between feminists and feminazis in order to garner more support and to have feminist ideas to be taken more seriously.

Change my view guys!","&gt;  In either case, I feel like it would be beneficial to cause a clear divide between feminists and feminazis in order to garner more support and to have feminist ideas to be taken more seriously.


This is an impossibility.  Those labels are self imposed.  Most people  - namely those fighting for a cause - won't elect pejorative labels for themselves.  You want to distinguish those who want equality (feminists) by calling them Egalitarian.  Femenazis (who currently go by feminist) would then do what?  Continue to call themselves by an abandoned name because it was the equal opposite of macho?  Probably not.  Those who are perceived to be Femenazis, probably perceive themselves as Feminists.  When the title changes, everyone will switch over.","I think we just need to make the feminist organizations that are more egalitarian prominent. I personally have been doing research and haven't really found any, which doesn't mean they don't exist, but they should be brought out and heard. And if they don't exist, a group should be created. Media puts too much focus on the extremists in feminism, and that gives everyone a negative view of the word. I wish we heard more from feminist egalitarian organizations, or leaders too. Especially during times when the media starts showing all the extreme feminists doing things that are disrespectful and people start calling them feminazis. Then we could be like ""hey yeah, we know they're the extremists, but here are those of us that support equal rights.""",A,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

I didn't feel it was appropriate to discuss the douchiness of it there so I decided to make this post.

You go into a parking lot and are trying to find a place to park. There's one 15 spots away from the door and then there's one that's 3 spots away from the door. One of them is meant for expectant mothers but there is no punishment for parking there if you are not an expectant mother which makes the two spots equivalent in everything expect for distance from the door. Objectively, it's better to choose the closer one.

predict-explain,"This one seems so obvious to me but I'll provide the basic points:

It is a person's right to do whatever they want with their own body so long as doing so does not infringe on the rights of others.

Prostitution is, presumably, an agreement among consenting adults. I'm not trying to defend anything other than exactly this.

There is virtually no immediate difference between prostitution and pornography. Simply adding a camera with the intention of creating porn somehow makes the act legal. 

The reason it is so alarming is that it is a blatant violation of our rights to our own bodies. It's the government tacitly saying they are the ultimate authority as to who we have sex with and under what circumstances it is permitted.

Most importantly, since people will do it anyway, making it illegal forces it underground (just like drugs). In the places where it is legal it can be heavily restricted in ways that prevent disease and the rights of the workers can be protected. 



Since I don't think I've ever heard a single decent argument against this, I'm interested in having this deeply held belief challenged.

Edit: I'm having a hard time responding to everybody but I really appreciate everyone's input. My perspective on this issue has increased immensely even if my position hasn't really changed. I no longer think it's ""alarming"" that the US hasn't shifted it's consensus to my way of thinking.

1) Legalizing prostitution might have a negative affect on poor women (or men, let's keep this gender neutral). With such a readily available income source, people who are struggling to pay the bills might become prostitutes instead of pursuing their actual goals. Similarly to how children in developing countries could be ""forced"" into child labor if it is legal, people can be economically ""forced"" into prostitution. I believe people should have a right to their own body etc, but when economics are involved, it becomes a little fuzzy. For example, we do not allow people to sell body organs, because those who are desperate for money would feel compelled to.

2) Prostitution is far harder to regulate than you seem to think, and it's tough to protect men or women who are putting themselves in a vulnerable situation where they are alone with a ""customer"". Sexual assault and other forms of violence are not uncommon in these situations.","I feel it's safe to assume that if legalization occurs, prevalence of prostitution will increase, as there won't be any repercussions legally.

Prostitution is a profession that takes a huge mental toll on the people doing the job. 47% of prostitutes need treatment for abuse of alcohol and drugs. 70% of women in prostitution in San Fransisco have been raped on the job. A study in Portland, Oregon, found that prostitutes were raped on average once a week. 85% of women in Minneapolis were raped. 94% of women involved in street prostitution have been sexually assaulted. 

Let's check the Netherlands, a nice country where prostitution is **legal**. 70% of women (prostitutes) experienced verbal threats of assault, 60% actually suffered physical assault, 40% experienced sexual violence and 40% were forced or pressured into the profession. PTSD rates are between 45 and 84%. From 5 countries, researches found that 2/3 of prostitutes have PTSD.   
[Source](http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/pdf/Prostitutionin9Countries.pdf)

If one were to take away the having sex with strangers for money aspect, any profession that boasts such rates of PTSD and sexual assault, etc. isn't anything that any government would want its citizens partaking in, especially as it isn't necessary for society to function. Your parents when you were a kid probably didn't want you going out and smoking crack cocaine, so they probably told you ""you can't do that"". That, with making the profession illegal, is what the government is doing- it don't want its citizens prostituting themselves.

It shouldn't be legal because legalization promotes a lifestyle that is extremely harmful and has many adverse effects.",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A presents a more nuanced argument against legalizing prostitution, focusing on the potential negative impact on economically vulnerable individuals and the difficulty in regulating and protecting individuals in the industry. These points address specific concerns that the original poster may not have considered, leading to a more persuasive argument. 

Reply B, while providing statistics and data on the negative effects of prostitution, does not directly address the original poster's points and instead focuses on the harmful aspects of the profession. While this information is important, it may not be as effective in changing the original poster's view as it does not directly counter the original arguments presented."
predict-explain,"For the purpose of this post, I am defining ""capitalism"" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. ""Socialism"" is defined as a system in which the government owns the means of production, and distributes all things necessary for decent quality of life (food, water, shelter, education, health care, etc) for free to all minors and any adult either working, seeking work, or enrolled in school. I understand that this definition is more specific than the true definition of socialism, but I want to preempt any arguments suggesting that people won't look for work if everything is provided for them anyway; they won't be provided for unless they contribute. Also, please note that I am not advocating any specific system of governance; I don't want a debate about the merits of direct democracy. Assume that the system of governance is something effective and relatively democratic, unless there is a compelling reason why my definition of socialism ensures ineffective government.

With that out of the way, here is my justification. I believe that capitalism ensures exploitation of the lower-classes. The winners in a capitalist system are nearly always those who were born into relative wealth already. Even the rags-to-riches stories of our time, such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, they were all born into at least lower-middle class. Those trapped in poverty are normal people, who usually work much harder than the people at the top, and get nothing for it. I don't mean to put down high-ranking executives, or other wealthy individuals, but I think that if capitalism is designed to benefit those who work hard, it's doing a shoddy job. Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair.

And that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.

Not only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a ""Green!"" or ""Eco-Friendly"" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot). 

So, with those reasons put out for why capitalism is bad, here's why I think socialism is better. Socialism prevents needless death and suffering by ensuring that everyone who contributes gets everything they need for a healthy life. Socialism ends cyclical poverty by giving everyone a chance at education, without worries about putting food on the table. Socialism is better for rewarding the hard-workers and punishing the slackers, because without unfair head starts going to rich kids entering the workforce, the real cream will rise to the top (there would be variable wages and such; the government employers could offer raises and promotions to their best workers). Socialism is better for the environment, because the government could have direct control, and would have much more incentive to manage the environment in sustainable ways than short-term-minded corporations.

I guess I can go further in depth in my replies, if needed. I'm looking for a good debate, and maybe a change of heart. Change my view!

EDIT: OK all, so I have been persuaded by a combination of factors that socialism as I define it is not as good as capitalism with generous welfare policies and heavy regulations (think Nordic model). I'll be giving out deltas now. I will continue debating as well, but I think I'm done for now. I will resume later.

Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.

I think your facts are wrong here.  Global capitalism feeds billions and prevents waste, whereas socialism has created immense waste, suffering, and deprivation.

To take a specific example, let's look at China.  China had a communist revolution in the 1940s, and has been governed by the Communist party since.  From the beginning of their rule, the party, under Mao, engaged in a program of collectivization and state control of the means of production.  This peaked in the late 1950s with the ""Great Leap Forward.""

It was the largest mass killing in human history.  In three years, [between 20 and 43 million people died](http://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/mao-and-great-leap-forward), largely as the result of starvation.

Since the death of Mao, beginning under Deng Xiaoping, China has adopted capitalist market reforms, including private ownership of capital, property rights, and open trade with other countries.  In that time, [the percent of Chinese residents in extreme poverty has gone from about 84% to about 12%](http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/04/18/heres-how-much-poverty-has-declined-in-china/).  Socialism failed in China and resulted in mass death.  Capitalism has succeeded and pulled hundreds and hundreds of millions of people out of abject poverty.

*edit:* I typoed Deng's name.","*Note: I don't have a lot of information on your whole post, but on the economics side.

&gt;And that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve.

Acually global starvation levels have plummeted since China under Dang Xiapeng went through a capitalistic switch in economic thinking,  more than 500M chinness people have enterned the middle class while the rest are being lifted up.

&gt;Clical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.

Well what you see as faluires other countries see as success example look at China pre Deng Xiaoping and how 60m-70m people starved to death and this is a country that has a larger landmass than the US and has very good farm land, the government organized farmers in antempt to bring people out of poverty the end solution was 60m-70m died due to starvation.


This graph shows the best, in 1978/1979 China Privitized it's farms and they went to a market based system lifting 100s of millions of people out of poverty and into the middle class.(look at this graph: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Prc1952-2005gdp.gif)


Other countries have followed suit to achieve the same success and what is needed to fund this growth in the economy when you aren't as devolped........child labour every country did it from England, USA, to Canada
To say it's only capitalist flaw, that's wrong the Soviet Union had it, Anceint Egypt, North Korea, and many more none capitalistic countries, whenever you have quick growth starting from the bottom everyone works from 5 year olds to 80 year olds.


Capitalism has produced the richest ""People"" in the world record number of people are not starving to death more people are going to schools and are getting treated in hospitals, even some illness that killed millions a 100 hundred years ago has been cured due to capital in the market place.﻿

Theses countries are devolping just like we did 100 years ago and they are going to go through the same things and no one will be able to stop them, look at polls done in China in the 1990s about if their better off know the numbers were in the 90% agreeing they had a better life currently.


&gt;Not only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a ""Green!"" or ""Eco-Friendly"" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot).


Well that's not a fair argument since the Soivet Union, North Korea, and other Socialist countries back in the 70s and 80s were known to use the worste envirmental standards in the world.

Also the reason we need oil production still is the fact we need things, even solar power, hydro, wing, and electronic cars still use oil in the production of that item. 



&gt; Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair.

predict-explain,"The Golden Rule: Treat others the way you would like to be treated.

The Silver Rule: One should not treat others in ways that one would not like to be treated

The Platinum Rule: Do unto others as they would want done to them.

I have found these rules to be particularly compelling and surprisingly thorough as a foundation for morality and moral behavior.

The golden rule and its derivatives/variations are a solid standard of morality and moral behavior. I have not encountered a substantial and convincing refutation to the set of the gold/silver/platinum rules, nor convincing evidence that they are missing anything nontrivial. The golden rule did have a significant flaw, which is covered by the platinum rule.

*Why I want to change/expand my view*: Just in case I am missing anything regarding what to consider when analyzing moral decisions or conclusions.

*How my view might be changed*: One possible way I could see that might help me change my view is by coming up with a significant item that is not accounted for by these rules. Or, demonstrating why the Golden Rule is flawed as a premise in the first place.

I invite you to CMV.

**Edit**: A lot of responses talk about criminals who don't want to be punished. I don't consider this to be a valid counterexample because the Rules are meant to be generalized, they run both ways. A criminal has no grounds to expect to *benefit* from the Rule if they break it themselves. This is a logical inconsistency/hypocrisy on the part of the criminal, not a fundamental flaw with the Rule (unless someone can explain otherwise).

How we treat each others is a secondary concern/consequence - how we treat ourselves is primary - it has existential primacy, which means it is more fundamental. (This primacy of how we treat ourselves is implied by the gold and silver rules, but not the platinum). 

The core of morality is that the individual has the capacity to choose, and all choices have different consequences that one choice is better and of greater value than another. To deliberately choose a greater value over the lesser is the core of morality, and to choose the bad over the good is the core of immorality.

The Gold and Silver rules are only as good as this more fundamental aspect of morality, how you treat yourself. Even Robinson Crusoe, alone on an island, has choices to make that make him either a virtuous man who works hard and struggles to do the right things to survive, or an immoral man who ignores his circumstances and chooses to laze on the beach wishing vainly for the coconuts to fall.

There are thousands of virtues (and vices) that have nothing to do with others, but that require a sustained effort of moral/righteous choices to attain *such as*: self-honesty, integrity, clarity of mind, industry, productiveness, rationality, creativity, focus/concentration, imagination, pride, courage, determination, knowing when to reward/punish yourself, knowing when to push on or rest etc etc!

The Golden and Silver rules are only as useful to society as the virtues you have yourself! (The platinum sounds like a nightmare of second-guessing other people's thoughts...I'm a bit iffy on that one).","The Golden rule is obviously deeply flawed, because people want very different things.  The Platinum rule gets around this, but there are more than a few problems with it.

1. Uncertainty.  It is often hard to know what others want.  It's a nice idea to treat others they want to be treated, but in practice that's hard to do.

2. What a person wants may require you doing an immoral act.  If a heroin addict wants you to give them heroin, does that mean it is moral to do so?

3. Conflict.  Often the wants of one person may be in conflict with another.  A person may not want to be put in prison, but if they are killing people, it is moral to put them there for the protection of others. How does this help you decide between mutually oppositional desires?",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a more nuanced and in-depth analysis of morality, focusing on the individual's capacity to choose and the importance of self-treatment in moral decision-making. It expands on the idea that treating oneself well is fundamental to moral behavior, which is not explicitly addressed in the original poster's view. Additionally, Reply A introduces the concept of virtues and vices that are not solely dependent on how one treats others, further expanding the discussion on morality.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the flaws of the Golden and Platinum rules, highlighting issues such as uncertainty, conflicting desires, and the potential for immoral actions. While these are valid points, Reply A provides a more comprehensive and thought-provoking argument that delves deeper into the core of morality and individual decision-making."
predict-explain,"I have been noticing the news about police officers shooting children or innocent people mistakely, and causing death or serious injuries a lot. So I thought, why would a police officer even use firearms (I mean the guns that can kill, I'm not sure since it's not my native language) if he/she doesn't intend to kill? I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing him/her, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen. Plus, even if the suspect is really guilty, a police officer shouldn't kill him/ her, right? And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?

There is a very narrow band, which is different for each individual person, that puts them under without taking away the possibility of waking up.

Okay, so what, why can't we make a standard dose for a gun?

The theory of police having a gun is that they use it when someone is threatening someone else with lethal force. If someone has a gun on either the officer or a civilian, if someone has a knife and is rushing the officer or a civilian, the officer has the gun to respond with appropriate force.

Let's look at what happens with a tranq gun in 3 scenarios.

In the very unlikely event that you have the exact right dosage: guy passes out. Probably not immediately, but maybe.

Dosage too high: you kill them. Not a huge difference from the gun.

Dosage too low: Uh oh, you still have a violent person charging you with a knife, and not enough time to draw a better weapon. You're probably going to get injured, and very well might die yourself.

The best worst-case scenario is the same as a gunshot wound. The worst worst-case scenario is cops getting killed left and right. The best case scenario doesn't have great odds, given the way dosages work with tranquilizers.

It's seriously just not a feasible weapon system, otherwise someone would be marketing it, selling it, and making a fortune.","Have you ever seen an anesthesiologist's paycheck? They get paid a lot, and a huge portion of what they get paid goes straight to malpractice insurance. This is because it's not easy to knock someone out, and it's even harder to do it without hurting or killing them. 

I'm no expert on tranquilizers but I know they are not the instant knock out guns movies make them appear to be. You have to get the drug in their system and it needs time to work. Time a person could use any number of ways, some dangerous.

Also, more importantly in my opinion, you're putting the person shot a risk. You're injecting an unfamiliar drug into their system. They could be allergic, or it could have an averse reaction with some other legal or illegal drug that they're taking. It could hurt them, cause permanent damage, or even kill them.

I fully believe in finding a solution to police killings, but this just isn't it.",A,A,"I would say reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a detailed explanation of why using tranquilizer guns as a standard weapon for police officers is not feasible. It addresses the complexities of dosages, the potential risks involved, and the likelihood of the weapon not being effective in high-pressure situations. This response offers a logical and practical perspective on the issue, which may lead the original poster to reconsider their initial viewpoint."
predict-explain,"Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, for example:

1. My child, my choice. Well, yes. And this is the closest one to a valid argument, IMO. But of course we put limits on what parents are allowed to do and choose for their children; you can't deprive your child of food or education (in the US) and be allowed to keep your child, so clearly it is NOT all your choice. While refusing vaccines is nowhere near on that level, not EVERY possible choice is equally acceptable, because your child is a person, not a piece of property. If the child had the capacity to refuse, I might be swayed, but unfortunately young babies can't understand vaccines on any reasonable level. And, more importantly, it IS still your choice under school vaccination schemes; you can choose to homeschool your child, or send them to private schools that don't care. Those choices aren't available to everyone and that's unfortunate (for far more important reasons than this), but...that's our current system anyway. Being rich gets you all kinds of benefits. I don't think this is different from being able to buy better medical care, better schools, better food, private tutors, and worlds more for your child if you have the resources (I do support basic income, which would alleviate this issue, but that's neither here nor there as we haven't got it). Public schools are a governmental service, and there are rules about who can and cannot use them. I think it is fine to say only vaccinated (or medically exempt) people can use them.

2. Not everyone can get vaccinated. That's why doctors are able to issue waivers for those not medically right for vaccination. This already happens and should continue.

3. Vaccines are dangerous. Not as dangerous as rampant infection. Honestly this is its own debate...But suffice it to say you are going to need some pretty major evidence to possibly CMV. I don't think it exists, but I won't rule it out. I don't really want to talk about vaccine efficacy as it has been done to death, but I guess if there's some truly amazing evidence...

4. Everyone is entitled to an education. They still are. Any unvaccinated child either needs to attend a non-public education option, be homeschooled or eschooled, provide a medical certificate that says they shouldn't be vaccinated, or get the shots. I don't necessarily have a strong view on the best way to handle noncompliance, and don't know enough about policy to say what would be most effective and just. Maybe fines for the parents? The same punishment as parents who refuse to send their kids to school or teach them at home for other reasons? I would not support removing the child from the home or incarcerating the parents, or any other severe punishment.

What would change my view: evidence that such a policy would have clear public health risks, would unavoidably keep children from getting an education, or would have some other major negative effect on society. I also am open to the idea that it is fundamentally unjust, though it doesn't seem that way to me right now.

Edit: My post focuses mainly on why I think mandatory vaccination isn't bad, but it occurred to me that it might be helpful to say why I think it's good. Mainly, I think it's good because it protects those who cannot be vaccinated and the minority of children for whom the vaccine was ineffective or wore off sooner than it ""should have"" based on medical guidelines. Children should be safe at school, and I think this promotes safety in a significant way--since children can die of preventable illness.

Edit2: If vaccines are prohibitively expensive and can't be obtained for free, this system is pretty shit for poor families. In my area you can get free vaccines in certain conditions, which are very lenient. If this isn't true everywhere in the US (and it almost certainly  isn't), it should be before vaccines are made mandatory.

Edit3: Going to bed now, will respond to new posts tomorrow. If it blows up, I might not get to everyone, but I will try to address any new points that are brought to the table.","As a teacher, I agree with you.  However, in my school law class, we discussed this issue at length and so I'll try to 'change your view' on one part regarding religion.

As other have noted, school is mandatory in the United States.  (Ever since the Supreme Court case *Society of Sisters* in 1925)  Sure, there are exemptions such as private tutoring or private school, but these are not feasible for all people.  Without any doubt, there are people who, due to circumstance, can only attend public school and are mandated to do so by Federal law. 

Now, courts have certainly tried to balance the liberty of the parents/student and the greater good in cases regarding education.  One Constitutional issue that gets particular scrutiny is that relating to religion in First Amendment.  First, there is the establishment clause, which basically says government cannot establish any sort of religion.  Second, there is the free exercise clause which basically says government cannot prevent persons from freely practicing their religion. 

Now, we look at the issue at hand.  Some religions expressly prohibit vaccination, and forcing them to get a vaccination would almost certainly been seen as a violation of the free exercise clause.  

Therefore, I wish to change your view on just this point:  Medical AND Religious exemptions must be considered, or else this idea (similar to Jerry Brown's new law in California) will be struck down by courts on First Amendment grounds.","As much as I hate defending the anti-vaccine crowd, I think the problem with mandatory vaccination for public school is that school is also compulsory. Ever since No Child Left Behind, education has been mandatory for all children until 16 or 18 (can't remember). Now the same people who demandon't children be sent to school also demand that in order to go to school, they must be vaccinated. 

Now, now you might say, that's only for public schools, what about private schools and home/eschooling? There's a problem with that too. Roughly 40% of children in the US live in single parent home, which rules out the prospect of homeschooling and eschooling becomes unviable because it's illegal to leave your kids alone at home. You also have a large percentage of the population who can't afford or don't have access to private schools. The amount of overlap here has the potential to be very high, especially in poor neighborhoods. 

So, now we have a segment of the population for whom public school is the only option. What are the odds that some of these people do not want their kids vaccinated, for whatever reason (ignorance usually, but that's not the point)? Pretty high. So now the question becomes, are we willing to fine and or imprison parents because they don't want their kid to get a vaccine and therefore won't send them to school? Personally, that is not something I'm willing to do, so I'm against mandatory vaccination in order to go to school.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides a detailed explanation of how mandatory vaccination in public schools could potentially violate First Amendment rights regarding religious freedom. By highlighting the importance of considering both medical and religious exemptions, Reply A addresses a key aspect of the original poster's argument and presents a strong case for why mandatory vaccination policies may not be as straightforward as they initially seem. Reply B, on the other hand, focuses more on the practical challenges and implications of mandatory vaccination for public school attendance, which may not directly address the original poster's concerns about the ethical and legal aspects of the issue."
predict-explain,"For whatever reason men commit about 80-90% of crimes in every society that they exist in. The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where men only outnumber women 2:1. However, white collar crimes, blue collar crimes, violent crimes, sexual crimes, etc. are so vastly male-centric that the numbers increase that much. They are both the overwhelming amount of perpetrators and victimized, though women are victimized significantly, as you'd expect, in intimate crimes and sex-related offenses. 

Aside from criminality, men are also more likely to be impulsive and aggressive which is likely to eliminate cohesion and cause undue caution due to the erratic, unpredictably violent and harmful action of this sub-group. 

Why does this persist? Why are men so much more criminal and violent? Does this have a tangibly negative effect on society?

If you define the term such that ""less crime"" = ""more cohesion"", then sure. But I don't think anyone disagrees with such an obvious point; we all agree that men commit more crime.

If you define it in any way that doesn't make your view painfully obvious, then I'm not so sure. Basically what you're saying is ""any group with an above average crime rate is detrimental to social cohesion"". Well, that would imply the populous of California and Texas are all detrimental to social cohesion, since they have above average crime rates. However, I doubt anyone would agree with such a notion, unless you define social cohesion in a weird way.

I mean, let's think about the logic you're using and apply it to other groups. People aged 18-65 also have an above average crime rate when compared to the general population. Does that mean people of this age are detrimental to social cohesion? Again, probably not, unless you define ""social cohesion"" very strangely.

Clearly then, the fact that group X commits a majority of crime is not sufficient evidence to suggest that group X is a detriment to social cohesion.","Lets look at groups of women - blondes, brunettes, red-heads, etc.  Imagine the crime rate for each group.  If nothing else, due to statistical noise, one group will have a higher per-capita crime rate than another.

Let's say it's brunettes - that is, brunette women are more likely to commit crimes than women with any other hair color.  Does that mean that brunettes are a detriment to social cohesion?

The flaw in that reasoning is that most women (and most men) do not commit crimes.  You're focusing on a minority of a group, and applying it to the majority.",A,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a logical argument by challenging the original poster's definition of ""societal cohesion"" and pointing out that simply having a higher crime rate does not necessarily make a group detrimental to social cohesion. It uses examples to illustrate that having an above-average crime rate does not automatically equate to being a detriment to society. 

On the other hand, reply B uses a hypothetical scenario about different groups of women to make a point about statistical noise and focusing on a minority of a group. While this may be a valid point, it does not directly address the original poster's argument about men and their higher rates of criminality and violence.

Overall, reply A presents a more coherent and logical argument that challenges the original poster's views, making it more likely to change their perspective."
predict-explain,"I attribute my agnosticism to this very theory. Looking at the Big Bang from a purely scientific perspective, we know, or think we know, that there was absolutely nothing in our universe before the Big Bang.

Now of course this nothingness is incomprehensible and even typing this it boggles my mind, but science's explanation is that nothingness caused the Big Bang. Now there are several theories to this, such as somehow two universes rubbing or colliding together which sparked the event. I'm no scientist and I'm sure people will correct me (please do), but the point is we really don't know how the Big Bang formed from what we consider to be nothing.

I tend to think, though, that some conscious entity had to be the catalyst that caused the event. It would seem that if there was nothing in our universe, some extra-dimensional being from another universe would have had to insert itself into ours, which sparked the event known as the Big Bang. I believe the being to be conscious because of the intentional way in which our universe seemed to form, and life sprung up. This begins to err on the side of intelligent design, but I do believe human beings, our consciousness, feelings, empathy, etc, have to be attributed to something higher.

I believe that entity to be God. Not necessarily in the Christian sense, or even that this being is benevolent, but that's my theory. Change my view.

Edited post to clarify that I believe the entity to be conscious and intentional in its insertion into our universe and subsequent cause of the Big Bang and our existence.

I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from your basic youth teams) and never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing it was simple as that. By losing and not being rewarded we understood we had to try harder as an individual and try harder as a team to win. This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team.  I really dont understand the idea of rewarding everyone for not winning, it's almost like saying ""hey, even if you dont try you still win"". I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize. To me that just teaches a kid that NOT giving your best will still result in a prize. What lesson does that teach you when you grow up? That your failure or lack of effort will be rewarded regardless of how you performed? Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up? Personally if I had a kid and he/she played a sport I wouldn't allow the coach or a parent to give them a trophy for simply participating, I would make them understand that a reward/trophy is earned by hard work and dedication. I know not all kids are athletic but I still dont understand the concept or idea. 
We all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? Again, I am not trying to sound cold but I just dont understand the concept of rewarding 
failure/losing, CMV......

Edit: thanks for all the answers, feedback and insight. Many of you helped CMV. Again, I hope I didn't come off as cold or inconsiderate. I have younger cousins and love to see them succeed in anything they do, especially sports. I was more interested in having a discussion as to ""why"" and the mentality behind it. Many of you made valid arguments and gave me some great insight. I'm happy to keep discussing if people are interested but please note I am not against the idea but was more interested in helping me change my view of it. If anything please continue to give your children positive feedback, effective communication, motivation and let them know that team work is a great thing. I recommend everyone put their kids in sports (dont push them into it but help and guide them into something they love doing or are very passionate about). It really does pay off when you get older and helps them build some self confidence and understand the dynamics of a social environment. Thanks again everyone! 

Edit 2: Since the discussion continues, I think children under 12 should only get participation Trophies. Once you hit that age you should be teaching your kids the fundamentals of structured team work, effort and the idea that life will not reward your for simply showing up. Giving participation trophies to kids 13 and above is not a good life lesson. If you care to continue CMV on that! 

Edit 3: Thanks everyone for the continued conversation, input, points of views and personal experiences. This sub is great for people who are curious as to get the other sides opinion and everyone should keep an open mind about changing their view on the matter. Now some last bit of advice for coaches and parents who put their kids in sports. PLEASE keep your eye out for the that one un-athletic kid who might not be the best on the team and make sure that his/her team mates understand this is a team event and that everyone is in this together. Some of these personal experiences shared with me shed some light on how people hated playing sports  and were being bulled because they were that kid and the other kids made them feel left out. Not all kids will be good athletes but you can teach your kids to respect one another, support one another and to ensure that they understand the unity of team work. If your kid is that ""all-star"" on the team then make them understand this most because the other kids will look to him/her to see how they treat the rest of the team. A good leader will understand this and this habit will grow with them, you just have to show them how and why. Thanks again for all the input, this is a great sub.","Other people are already addressing the fact that giving prizes for participation doesn't devalue victory, so I am going to go at this from a different angle. This is simply another overblown moral panic, children know participation trophies are utterly meaningless. The only people who give a damn about them are the few parents who think their kids will be devastated if they don't get a trophy and the current generation of zealots who are obsessed with their duty to decry obvious moral decay and are absolutely certain that *this* is truly the herald of societal decline (ignore the warnings from all previous generations). 

Every generation is convinced that the next one is taking us down the shitter, surely you remember the Rock and Roll panic? D&amp;D? Video games? To quote Margaret A. Blanchard “Parents and grandparents who lead the efforts to cleanse today’s society seem to forget that they survived alleged attacks on their morals by different media when they were children. Each generation’s adults either lose faith in the ability of their young people to do the same or they become convinced that the dangers facing the new generation are much more substantial than the ones they faced as children.”

There are examples throughout history suggesting this or that is a sign society is failing:

&gt; Dancing a Waltz:

&gt; The indecent foreign dance called the Waltz was introduced ... at the English Court on Friday last ... It is quite sufficient to cast one's eyes on the voluptuous intertwining of the limbs, and close compressure of the bodies ... to see that it is far indeed removed from the modest reserve which has hitherto been considered distinctive of English females...[Now that it is] forced on the respectable classes of society by the evil example of their superiors, we feel it a duty to warn every parent against exposing his daughter to so fatal a contagion.
- 1816

&gt; Living in cities:

&gt; Never has youth been exposed to such dangers of both perversion and arrest as in our own land and day. Increasing urban life with its temptations, prematurities, sedentary occupations, and passive stimuli just when an active life is most needed, early emancipation and a lessening sense for both duty and discipline... 
- 1904

&gt; Film:

&gt; ...[The screen artists'] beauty, their exquisite clothing, their lax habits and low moral standards, are becoming unconsciously appropriated by the plastic minds of American youth. Let them do what they may; divorce scandals, hotel episodes, free love, all are passed over and condoned by the young... The eye-gate is the widest and most easily accessible of all the avenues of the soul; whatever is portrayed on the screen is imprinted indelibly upon the nation's soul.
- 1926

&gt; Chess:

&gt; A pernicious excitement to learn and play chess has spread all over the country, and numerous clubs for practicing this game have been formed in cities and villages...chess is a mere amusement of a very inferior character, which robs the mind of valuable time that might be devoted to nobler acquirements, while it affords no benefit whatever to the body. Chess has acquired a high reputation as being a means to discipline the mind, but persons engaged in sedentary occupations should never practice this cheerless game; they require out-door exercises--not this sort of mental gladiatorship.
-1859

&gt; Fancy Umbrellas?

&gt; A mendacious umbrella is a sign of great moral degradation. Hypocrisy naturally shelters itself below a silk; while the fast youth goes to visit his religious friends armed with the decent and reputable gingham. May it not be said of the bearers of these inappropriate umbrellas that they go about the streets ""with a lie in their right hand""?
- 1894

&gt; Novels:

&gt; The free access which many young people have to romances, novels, and plays has poisoned the mind and corrupted the morals of many a promising youth; and prevented others from improving their minds in useful knowledge. Parents take care to feed their children with wholesome diet; and yet how unconcerned about the provision for the mind, whether they are furnished with salutary food, or with trash, chaff, or poison?
- 1790

&gt; And of course general decrying of decay:

&gt; We can assert with some confidence that our own period is one of decline; that the standards of culture are lower than they were fifty years ago; and that the evidences of this decline are visible in every department of human activity.
- 1948

&gt; ...a fearful multitude of untutored savages... [boys] with dogs at their heels and other evidence of dissolute habits...[girls who] drive coal-carts, ride astride upon horses, drink, swear, fight, smoke, whistle, and care for nobody...the morals of children are tenfold worse than formerly.
- 1843

&gt; Whither are the manly vigor and athletic appearance of our forefathers flown? Can these be their legitimate heirs? Surely, no; a race of effeminate, self-admiring, emaciated fribbles can never have descended in a direct line from the heroes of Potiers and Agincourt...
- 1771

&gt; ... I find by sad Experience how the Towns and Streets are filled with lewd wicked Children, and many Children as they have played about the Streets have been heard to curse and swear and call one another Nick-names, and it would grieve ones Heart to hear what bawdy and filthy Communications proceeds from the Mouths of such...
- 1695

&gt; Youth were never more sawcie, yea never more savagely saucie . . . the ancient are scorned, the honourable are contemned, the magistrate is not dreaded.
- 1624

&gt; The children now love luxury. They have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise.
~ 430 BC

Every previous generation has been wrong, but *this* time it's for real. 

Edit: And now I spent so long writing this the thread is already finished, I don't even get a participation trophy :(

Edit 2: I found one of my favorite excerpts from a book. I strongly recommend reading the [section](https://books.google.ca/books?id=svVeAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=tea%20beer&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=tea%20beer&amp;f=false) on tea, it is one of the most hilarious things I have ever read. 

*Cottage Economy; containing information relative to the brewing of beer, making of bread, keeping of cows, pigs, bees, ewes, goats, poultry, etc* by William Cobbett - 1822

&gt; ""I view the tea drinking as a destroyer of health, an enfeebler of the frame, an engenderer of effeminacy and laziness, a debaucher of youth, and a maker of misery for old age.""","I'm not going to argue for the virtue of participation trophies but for why it really doesn't matter.  Firstly, the trophy is literally a piece of plastic.  It's not like there are no winners or losers because if said competition offers anything of value, it would only be awarded to the winners.  Secondly (at least in my experience) even though everyone gets a trophy, only certain trophies will say ""Champion"" or ""Third Place.""  So the winners do get something differently.  Finally for those who try very hard in sports victory would be it's own reword.  Kids who really care about winning would do anything to win and the fact that the people they beat get some cheap plastic doesn't kill their drive.  It might coddle the losers in sports but, in my honest opinion, sports don't reflect other parts of society and the naturally talented athletes won't lose their motivation.  I'd also like to point out that the idea of 1st-3rd is just defined by our culture.  I mean what is second place besides a glorified participation trophy.  Sure they came close, but isn't 4th place pretty close too (depending on the size of the tournament)?",A,A,"I would say reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides historical examples of moral panics throughout different generations, showing that concerns about participation trophies are not unique and have been exaggerated in the past. This helps to contextualize the issue and suggest that perhaps the current concern is also blown out of proportion. Additionally, reply A highlights that children understand the meaninglessness of participation trophies and that it is primarily adults who place value on them. This challenges the original poster's belief that participation trophies have a negative impact on children's mentality. Overall, reply A offers a more insightful and nuanced perspective on the issue."
predict-explain,"A friend of mine held a Fourth of July event, and spent upwards of $500 on fireworks.  I've seen professional displays, choreographed and set to music, which were pleasant enough, but after a few minutes, what else is there but more of the same?

But this private display, ergh.  One, two, three tubes, willows, spinners, blah blah blah.  An hour and a half of this?  I got good and buzzed, and gave myself time to sober up, and still it went on and on and on.  No pace, no art, just whistle, bang, pretty lights.  And I drove home, and saw dozens of similar displays, all the same.  

These people are just enjoying the bang and zoom and pretty lights, they are not commemorating anything.  And I've seen all kinds of stories, people injured, even killed, by these things, which in my opinion offer little or no excitement or entertainment.

For you, fireworks may not offer much excitement so the risks of physical harm may not be worth the monetary cost or potential danger. However, you must recognize that there are many things which you may find boring but another person may find very entertaining.

For another person, fireworks may be the shit. They may spend all day and all night fantasizing about them. They may spontaneously orgasm every 4th of July for 5 hours gazing up at the sky. I personally don't understand how people enjoy birdwatching, either, but there's plenty of people who do. You can't possibly quantify what other people like.

For the people that enjoy fireworks and fireworks shows, the relatively small risk (if you handle them properly) compared to the enjoyment they get from the experience is worth it for them. They are paying for a night which they hold fond in their memories, a sense of wonder, a feeling of pleasure. You may not understand it and may even consider it a waste of time and resources, but that's OK. No one is holding a firecracker to your head and making you enjoy it.

Also, as a personal anecdote, this isn't terribly uncommon. It seems people either love fireworks or hate them. I personally love them, but only when I'm the one lighting them. For that reason, my family has always taken turns shooting ""our"" fireworks.","If you ever get the chance to make them, go to conventions, or see really spectacular shows put together by people who are passionate, fireworks become most definitely worth the risk.

It's important to keep in mind though, if you ever find yourself working with different chemicals, making fireworks or shooting them, they absolutely do deserve the same respect to safety as guns or any other dangerous activity",B,B,"I believe reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A acknowledges the subjective nature of enjoyment and entertainment, and highlights that what may not be exciting for one person can be extremely enjoyable for another. It also emphasizes that individuals who enjoy fireworks are paying for an experience that brings them pleasure and fond memories, which may not be something the original poster had considered. Additionally, it points out that everyone has different preferences and interests, and that it's okay for people to enjoy things that others may not understand. 

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the potential for fireworks to be worth the risk when experienced in a different context, such as at conventions or in spectacular shows. While this may be true, it doesn't directly address the original poster's concerns about the lack of enjoyment and entertainment value in private displays. 

Overall, reply A is more persuasive as it addresses the original poster's viewpoint more directly and provides a more empathetic and understanding perspective on why people may enjoy fireworks despite the risks and costs involved."
predict-explain,"Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for coupes other than they look cool or may be easier to park in places you wouldn't want to be driving anyways.

Economy coupes used to be a budget choice for younger people who didn't need the space, so auto companies can also save money on two doors. Marginally better gas mileage may be an incentive as well. High end luxury sport car manufacturers can argue that the coupe offers better aerodynamics/lower weight to improve performance and handling.Today, coupes cost the same if not more than the same model sedan. I don't believe a slimmer profile can noticeably improve performance in an economy 140HP car, similarly, I find the fuel economy improvement from 30 to 32 mpg hard to justify the loss of two doors at the same price.

 
Automatic transmission performance used to be inferior to manuals, and an expert could handle a car with manual significantly better than an auto. Today, the highest performance cars come with automatics, and manual often isn't an option anymore. Even in models that offer both, the 0-60 and quarter mile speed is quite a bit better in the automatic, which offers ""manual shifting"" anyways. 

I believe that their long history and inferior counterparts has created a aura of superiority over automatics, similar to the Stradivarius violins. Due to production quantities, a manual transmission costs the same as automatic if not more.

This leaves me with only a few situations where one would practically want a coupe:

High end 400-500+ HP sportscars which accelerate and go fast enough that the profile and marginal weight makes a difference.

And for manual transmission:

Old classic imitation cars for the nostalgia? They're plainly under performing now.

Whenever I see a Bentley or Benz S550/600 coupe, I cringe a bit since they're very obviously not performance based cars. 

Manual freaks who refuse to own any other cars also seem illogical as hell. 

Any thoughts?

This isn't actually true; most high performance cars come with selective shifting in the form of ""flappy paddles.""

I believe the only difference between a romantic relationship and a friendship/platonic relationship is physical attraction.  Lots of people talk of love or some mystical force, but in reality people make all sorts of concessions with regard to a person's character flaws and personality, but no one I have met is willing to compromise in terms of a desire to get nekkid with the person of their dreams.  There are other factors that come into play with regard to the interaction lasting or being fulfilling, but I do believe that the only fundamental difference between these two types of interactions is the sexual element.  Change my view.

I have very good female friends with whom I love spending time and whom I find very attractive, but I'm for some reason not romantically attracted to them. It's a weird gut feeling when I am eventually romantically attracted to someone that's not really describable but goes beyond standard platonic and sexual desires. I'd describe romantic attraction as different from sexual attraction, even - my last crush was someone with whom I guess I would have slept had the opportunity arisen but for whom I fell because of non-sexual things (mostly because I felt really, really comfortable with her). I would describe my attraction to her less as ""I wanted to sleep with her"" and more ""I wanted to cuddle with her and talk."" It depends, obviously, but not everyone feels that way about romantic attraction.","I'm only going to challenge this for the part where:

&gt;I believe the only difference between a romantic relationship and a friendship/platonic relationship is physical attraction.

And it's not going to be about mystical forces or destiny or any such nonsense. It's going to be about my own crude understanding of modern neuroscience. 

The part you're missing in the above description is that romantic love also has two other key components in most tests, which I'll call **prioritization** and **interconnection**.

I'll start with the latter because it's harder to catch, but easier to visualize: **Interconnection** is how much your thoughts about X are connected to other thoughts. In simplified terms, whenever you think of ""Ice Cream"", your neurons will also send signals to other nearby concepts, such as the taste associated with ice cream, memories related to ice cream, images, coldness, and so on, and this propagates through a network of concepts and memories in your brain. 

With a normal person that you spend a lot of time with, that ""person"" in your mind is actually a lot of different concepts and nodes that connect to a lot of other things, and their name and face are only small parts of that. When you think about that girl Lorraine the Model, you're more likely to trigger the neurons in your brain related to the color pink because you know she likes pink, and she often wears it, so the connections between the nodes that contain your mental model of Lorraine are more closely connected with the nodes that fire off when you think of the color pink, than if you were to think about George the Office Guy. 

With someone that you're starting to get romantically attracted to, beyond the simple physical lust/attraction, it's frequently observed that you'll also start... ""enlarging"" the network of connections from that person-concept to other concepts and memories in your brain, so that ""they"" connect to more things in your mind... and more other things in your mind connect to ""them"". 

To visualize this, look at [this graph here](http://nickpegg.com/media/img/more_fun_with_graphs/nys-super-sanitized.png) and imagine this graph represents concepts in your mind. Green are clear concepts (""walking"", ""ice cream"", etc.), beige are specific memory data, and yellow are persons. Naturally this image isn't actually about neurons in brains, but it serves for this illustration. Notice the one yellow node that is so much more connected than the other yellow nodes? How it has many more memory/experience connections, but also due to its larger share of space is connected to more green concepts as well? 

That's the person you're getting romantically attracted to. 

**Prioritization** is simpler. It's when some concept in your mind has more affect associated with it, and thus holds higher *value*. It's frequently observed in tests that subjects will pay a higher cost to protect their SO / subject of romantic love than would be explained by the simple combination of platonic relationship and physical attraction. It's also harder to visualize, because it's not a linear number that you can just add up... letting that person cry for a few hours alone is still less negatively valued than letting your brother die, for instance. However, to take the graph analogy above, when a moral or hedonistic calculation goes through the nodes for this person, the resulting choice will weigh more heavily in that direction if the subject was one you were romantically attracted to than if the subject were only someone you were lusting for and had a platonic relationship with. 

In other words, it also depends on how much space they occupy in your mental map (measured by how often thinking about something else makes you also think about them) and how much emotion is generated when they are involved (measured by how long you spend crying if they tell you you're stupid vs someone else tells you you're stupid... or preferably some other, less painful method). Not just how much you interact with them, how much you trust them or how much you want to fuck them.",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a detailed explanation of the neuroscience behind romantic attraction, focusing on the concepts of prioritization and interconnection in the brain. By breaking down the components of romantic love beyond just physical attraction, Reply B offers a more comprehensive and scientific perspective on why romantic relationships are different from platonic relationships. This detailed explanation is likely to challenge the original poster's belief that physical attraction is the only fundamental difference between romantic and platonic relationships. 

In contrast, Reply A mainly relies on personal experiences and feelings to argue that romantic attraction goes beyond standard platonic and sexual desires. While personal anecdotes can be compelling, they may not be as persuasive in changing someone's view when compared to a detailed scientific explanation like the one provided in Reply B."
predict-explain,"EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis)used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People who cry 'triggered' because something reminds them of a NON EXTREME incident or issue they are struggling with should not be sheltered or given the attention they are seeking. 

EDIT 2: For some reason I feel that not everybody finished reading my post although theres a tl;dr and a very clear message that my views dont apply to extreme cases like in people who have PTSD yet Im getting all these (actually heartwrenching and very valid arguments) about people with PTSD whom my beef isnt with.

EDIT 3: All in all I think my anger towards modern day 'trigger happu tumblrinas' has somewhat subsided and Im beginning to understand that we cant scruitinise how everybody feels and that some people are stronger than others like one user said and that the effects of triggers on some people can be deadly. 

Thank you all! :)

In 7th and 8th grade I was a snob. This was probably because I am the youngest of five siblings and was fairly better looking than my classmates (before the acne, bad eyesight and crooked teeth kicked in) among other things. 


I realised this because of the way my classmates talked about me and treated me and I took the summer of 8th grade to transform into somebody else. I do not recall how exactly I did it but I did. Everybody was surprised, myself included, that the transformation was permanent and genuine.

Sadly, I was no longer a bitch but a pushover instead. I was bullied shortly after and had a horrible 8 or so years until I graduated from university. During those 8 or so years, my first love died in a car crash, my parents had a terrible accident leaving my mother unable to walk for a year, of course I picked up smoking, I started to serial-date guys and their treatment to me kept getting progressively worse all while I tried to do well at university because it was getting too expensive for my parents to pay for and getting a job wasn't enough for me to sustain myself.

Add to the above a religious struggle between myself, my society and my own mother who didn't talk to me for three months while I lived in the same house as her because of my religious and romantic choices (I was dating a black guy), and you get a fairly broken person.

I didn't trust anyone, I was naive, nervous, insecure, a people pleaser, somewhat promiscuous and a smoker. I did things I never thought I'd do and was put in situations I never wanted to be placed in.


I was even ashamed of my own psychologist whom I never went back to visit after a couple of sessions because of how fucked up I was.

My issues seem trivial but these are just the things that I haven't blocked out. My view does apply to individuals who have gone through everything but EXTREME trauma. 

My POINT is: How can I, and so many people who have gone through worse, emerge as functional if not even better people than we were because of what we went through by using our own logic and reasoning, the help of others, counselling and other resources, while others simply act as if life is supposed to be somehow tailored for them and that whatever 'triggers' them by making them actually have to THINK about what they went through should somehow be erased from their lives?


Tl;dr: Shit happens in life and people should wade through the pile of crap and come out as functional human beings via their own logic rather than project their issues unto others and claim that whatever 'triggers' them to think about their problems must somehow be banished or banned.

That led to a flashback, I am mentally not fit to be in the work force so me ""not being able to get a job"" was a blow to my self esteem that made me spiral downwards into depressive thoughts and finally i had a flashback. now, this is just an example but let me point out a few key things.

1) a part of the reason was because i was already stressed out at the time, i was put into a corner of drama from a few different people before that happened.

2) if there was no stress, I may have been able to identify that i may be close to having an episode.

3) it wasn't 'one word' that caused this, it was a mix of paragraphs of insults.

Triggers do exist and for some they can be far different than others, i do believe someone bringing up rape could 'possibly' trigger a victim into a flashback of what happened, but i doubt that just the word alone would cause it. now if they went to see a movie and there was a disturbing rape scene then that would be more of an understandable trigger. In closing, i somewhat agree with you stating people should be able to overcome our issues. but that doesn't happen out of nowhere in a split second. people struggle for years before they can achieve being better.","Triggers are certainly real. If you've experienced a traumatic event like rape or witnessing someone's death, there will very likely be something that brings you to a state of distress.

The problem today is that people use the term 'triggered' to label normal feelings of sadness, shame, or embarrassment, resulting in someone who actually has a real trigger not being taken seriously when they say they have a trigger.

Ex. My ex was really abusive and it took almost 2 years of daily full-blown panic attacks to be able to leave the house calmly. Loud noises would set me off, especially doors slamming(I connected this now to him slamming the door when he was mad and I knew I'd be his punching bag). That was an actual trigger for me, but I would never call it that because of all this bullshit tumblrina garbage about triggers. It actually took me almost a year to ask my parents if they could try not to slam the doors because of this. I felt really bad about asking but they were super understanding.

Another, that I still have, is people touching my hair because ONE TIME he yanked me by the hair across the room. I still don't know why I can't get over this one, but it's there and honestly isn't that big of a deal anymore. I just tell people beforehand to not touch my hair and we're cool.

Something that IS NOT a 'trigger' is when someone calls me a bitch or something that he would call me. I just get pissed off at them like any other normal person would. Sure, it sometimes reminds me of when he would say it, but it isn't a trigger. 
For some people who maybe had an abusive upbringing, certain words like 'bitch' COULD be a trigger. But saying it's a trigger for you just because you don't like being called a bitch is just crap.

So yes, triggers do still exist. All this BS you see online about people listing their triggers is just not knowing how to identify with their (completely normal) emotions.",A,A,"I would say that reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because reply A provides a personal example of how triggers can affect someone with PTSD, explaining the complexity and seriousness of the issue. The user also acknowledges that some people misuse the term ""triggered"" to gain control over conversations, which shows an understanding of the original poster's concerns about the misuse of triggers. 

Reply B, while also providing personal examples, focuses more on the misuse of triggers and less on the actual impact they can have on individuals with PTSD. It does not delve as deeply into the emotional and psychological effects of triggers, which may not be as effective in changing the original poster's view on the topic. 

Overall, reply A provides a more nuanced and empathetic perspective on triggers and their effects, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"Why I hold this view:

1.  America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.

2. Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda executed a brutal plan to orchestrate the 9/11 attacks. [According to them, their major motivation was to end the presence of US in gulf countries and other motives as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks#Motives) For this purpose they chose to ram airplanes in the WTC  &amp; Pentagon to achieve maximum civilian casualties and make a frightening spectacle for the US public. The ends justify the means seems to be their reasoning. Was Al-Qaeda &amp; Co justified in perpetrating 9/11? 
No one would say yes.

     If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths. 


3. Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.

4. The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared. How do we even know the outcome of Operation Downfall? Moreover Japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the Secretary Of War, Henry Louis Stimson agreed: 

“Japan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.”


We erased two cities and its people from history. We dehumanized them, reduced them to a statistic. W[e even censored images and stories of the Japanese victims to push the narrative in our direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Depiction.2C_public_response_and_censorship). At least the Government should officially apologize to the nation of Japan.","I think its important to remember when reviewing history, that we not use modern notions of morality and hindsight to judge the actions of those in the past without understanding the context those decisions were made, which includes the morals and norms of the day, and the physical evidence they had available.

Every time the atomic bombs are mentioned, it seems like people keep bringing up the same arguments about how the atomic bombs were unnecessary. About how these were intended to kill civilians and were unnecessary since Japan was going to surrender anyways.

None of these, however, take into account what the decision makers had to deal with at the time, nor do they take into account the facts about Japan's situation at the time.

The whole talk about how the bombs were unnecessary and that Japan was seeking to surrender forgets that Japan didn't surrender despite given multiple chances. On July 26th, the Allies in Europe already issued the Potsdam Declaration, demanding Japan's immediate and unconditional surrender - something the Allies wanted to ensure they could never have a repeat of Germany's rise after WWI which caused WWII. Two of the points here:

&gt;Point 10: We do not intend that the Japanese shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners. The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established.
&gt;
&gt;Point 13: We call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction.

Not only did the Japanese refuse this unconditional surrender, but Japan thought it could broker a peace with the US through the Soviet Union which was already preparing its invasion of Japan, to honor its agreement to declare war on Japan within 100 days of its victory over Germany.

In addition, the power struggle in Japan's government means that civilian government overtures to the Americans held little weight. The Japanese military government was the de facto power in Japan and often overruled the civilian government.

Furthermore, the civilian government simply wasn't trusted by the US or any Allied nations. The Americans remembered that on the afternoon of December 7, Japanese diplomat Kurusu delivered Japan's reply closing with the statement that ""The immutable policy of Japan is to promote world peace."" He didn't know, due to the lag in communications, that at that moment, the bombing of Pearl Harbor had already commenced. What diplomatic integrity did Japan have in the eyes of the nations they had attacked at that point?

Aerial and naval reconnaissance of the Japanese home islands showed that the Japanese were digging in and preparing for an invasion. These diplomatic overtures were often seen as just stall tactics in order to better fortify the Japanese home islands to make an invasion less appealing, and thus give better terms for a brokered peace, which was the last thing the Allies wanted. In fact, the Allies knew that Japan had tried that strategy before – the whole point of the attack on Pearl Harbor was to buy time for the Japanese to implement their defenses in the Pacific in the hopes that it would make an American counter-offensive unpalatable. 

Speaking of an invasion, Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan, was planned to commence in less than 100 days. The pre-invasion aerial and naval bombardment was scheduled for late October, and Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu was set for X-Day, November 1st. 

The estimates for the death toll of an invasion of Japan were tremendous. This isn't some post-war revisionist estimates either - the military had estimated casualties based on the ever-rising death toll as the US got closer to the Japanese home islands. On Iwo Jima, for instance, only 216 of the 21,000 Japanese defenders surrendered. The US suffered over 6,700 killed and another 20,000 wounded in 35 days of fighting for *8 square miles* of island.

Okinawa was even more horrendous - over 12,000 Americans were killed, another 55,000 wounded, and 38 ships lost in just 88 days of fighting. The Japanese suffered even more - over 77,000 killed with another 100,000+ civilians killed on those islands. That’s estimated to be a third of the civilian population of Okinawa. Now extrapolate that Kyushu, with its much higher population and highly populated cities (urban combat is notoriously deadly - over 200,000 were killed in 16 days in the Battle of Berlin), and any estimate is going to start in the hundreds of thousands killed.

The alternative to an invasion, of course, was to blockade Japan and starve its people to death. This would take time - and would ultimately have killed even more Japanese than the bombings would have, as history’s famines have shown time and again. Famine isn’t just discriminate – it disproportionately targets the weak, elderly, and young who would die first. Likewise, with food rations given to soldiers as a priority, civilians would have been disproportionately affected even further.

Thus, the atomic bombs were to be part of the series of aerial bombardment raids designed to cripple Japan's ability to fight and hopefully force a surrender before the invasion was necessary. The US had already done firebombing, such as the raid over Tokyo which killed more people than the atomic bombs did, as part of this same strategic bombing campaign.

The atomic bombs were thus viewed as a new and more efficient way to carry out the campaign. Keep in mind that all the negative focus on nuclear weapons of today is borne entirely out of our experience with nuclear weapons from these bombings AND from the decades of the Cold War. The very concept of nuclear weapons being unfathomable to use in war didn’t exist in 1945, and one could argue, largely came about precisely because these weapons were used.

And for all the people that say the US wanted to kill indiscriminately, the fact is, the US dropped leaflets on over 30 cities in Japan in the weeks and months before the atomic bombings, warning Japanese civilians to evacuate their cities. They even very specifically mention that they are not targeting civilians, but the installations and workshops and factories of war.

The Japanese text on the reverse side of one of the leaflets dropped carried the following warning:

&gt; “Read this carefully as it may save your life or the life of a relative or friend. In the next few days, some or all of the cities named on the reverse side will be destroyed by American bombs. These cities contain military installations and workshops or factories which produce military goods. We are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique which they are using to prolong this useless war. 
&gt;
&gt;But, unfortunately, bombs have no eyes. So, in accordance with America's humanitarian policies, the American Air Force, which does not wish to injure innocent people, now gives you warning to evacuate the cities named and save your lives. America is not fighting the Japanese people but is fighting the military clique which has enslaved the Japanese people. The peace which America will bring will free the people from the oppression of the military clique and mean the emergence of a new and better Japan. 
&gt;
&gt;You can restore peace by demanding new and good leaders who will end the war. We cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked but some or all of them will be, so heed this warning and evacuate these cities immediately.”

Chilling to read those words, even today.

The bombing of Hiroshima, however, was met with silence from the Japanese. As thus, the US proceeded again with the bombing of Nagasaki. Why a second one? 

Simply because that was part of the strategy laid out to get Japan to surrender - the US would use atomic bombs as they were manufactured and became available. Keep in mind that during this time, the US could not mass-produce atomic weapons like it ended up being capable of doing in the Cold War. The centrifuges simply weren't up to the quality and ability of years later, and so early on, they were only able to manufacture one or two bombs a month. Nagasaki was the second and last of the bombs available – the next one wouldn’t be ready for use for more another week with planners estimating the US having only 7 total available by the time of X-Day.

Thus it wasn't about dropping a second bomb to be punitive – it was dropped because a second one was available. In other words, the plan was to eventually use the bombs continually until Japan surrendered or the invasion began in which case the bombs would then continue to fall in direct support of the troops until Japanese capitulation.

And still, even with the Soviet entry into the war against Japan, there was silence and even resistance to surrender. An attempted coup against the Japanese emperor was tried but failed, and the Emperor made his famous broadcast to the Japanese people declaring his decision to surrender. In it, he very specifically mentions the atomic bombs, to which I conclude:

&gt;Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should We continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.","&gt; America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.

The other way of ending the war was a full scale land invasion, which would have resulted in many more casualties and destruction than what the final atomic bombings caused.

[Japan was in no mood to surrender prior to this, or even after the first bombing.](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/the-pacific-war-1941-to-1945/operation-downfall/)

&gt; If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths.

YOu're completely ignoring the major military significance of those cities.

Hiroshima was a major army depot with many military headquarters, Nagasaki was a major industrial and port city home to many of the nation's war efforts, that had already been targeted before.

&gt; Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified.

If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.

Apples and oranges to compare Al-Qaeda, a rogue terrorist organization and total war between nations.

[Everybody was attacking civilian targets in WW2.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II).  When nations go to war, that is what happens.

&gt; The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared.

You have no way of knowing that civilians would have been spared, they could just have easily have been conscripted to fight.

The Japanese had time and again shown that they *would not* surrender. [That they would candidly fight to the death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima), in Saipan [civilians killed themselves to avoid capture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saipan#Civilian_casualties)

&gt; “Japan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.”

And despite all that, they still refused to surrender. At some point, you have to acknowledge that the Japanese have culpability for some of this as well.

[To single out the atomic bombings as some kind of extra-inhumane effort on behalf of the USA, is little odd, given that our conventional air raids did much more damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raids_on_Japan)",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a detailed explanation of the context in which the decision to drop the atomic bombs was made, including the military situation at the time and the potential consequences of a land invasion of Japan. It also addresses the attempts to warn civilians and the strategic goals behind targeting specific cities. This reply provides a thorough analysis of the situation and presents a strong argument for the justification of the atomic bombings based on the information available at the time. On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on refuting the original poster's points without providing as much historical context or analysis of the decision-making process. Therefore, Reply A is more likely to be persuasive in changing the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"How can you convince me that all the nations that i'm allowed to visit aren't all working together to hide a bigger and better and more free world. Maybe the internet I know is actually just a restricted and monitored intranet.

To work, censorship must be pretty broad.  Otherwise you see people making end-runs around that censorship and finding widespread agreement.  For instance, if you are not allowed to say anything bad about the Emperor, you will inevitably find people sharply criticizing local police while maintaining that ""surely if the Emperor knew he would do something"".

We have no signs of that.  When you get close to saying something bad (for instance, your post) you aren't punished.  People don't agree on the ""close to saying it"" part because it doesn't match our experience.  To fool us this well, mere censorship would be grossly insufficient - you'd need supernatural mind control.","Lets imagine a hypothetical: a person from this utopia comes here to try and tell us the truth (happens all the time in North Korea).

Now, what would have to happen to stop us from finding out?

1) massive internet monitoring and a flurry of deleted posts on reddit, facebook, twitter etc.  Have you noticed odd activity like that?

2) If a billboard went up, or a person was handing out fliers, a government force would have to physically detain him.  To do that they would need to know the truth and believe in the rightness of their cause.  North Korea pulls that off by explicit indocrination.  We don'ty have that.  You couldn't count on our cops or military to follow those rules.  So they can't know.  And if our cops and military can't know the truth it means that whoever wants to spread the truth will have a long time to do so before the secret government forces can get from their base in washington to small town Ohio.  And when they arrive they better HOPE that this person didn't go straigth to the local police.  Because if they did the cops are going to resist the secret government forces (and since they are secret they don't have explicit authority and so can, legally, be resisted violently - in fact our police would be under a duty to do so).

Anyways it doesn't work.  We don't have the infrastructe necessary to pull it off.",A,A,"I would say reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"I have lived in Columbus, Ohio my entire life and have now been legally able to drive for 5 years.  I have driven near and far and have never had to take a toll road.  I recently ventured into Pennsylvania for an internship and was absolutely flabbergasted by the toll roads.  I have always heard from people that they are good because they have higher speed limits.  A lot of the free highways i have been on have 70 mph speed limits and when I went into Pennsylvania, I paid $5.00 to go 40mph on a ""highway"" for a whopping 2 miles.

Regardless of how fast you may go, companies need to pay taxes for using the land on which they have built the road. The public roads you travelled on are payed by your taxdollars, but private companies must also pay taxes to maintain their private roads. The money has to come from somewhere.

Aside from this, toll roads also create detours from the regular chokepoints in public highways. People use the roads because it provides a shorter path to their destination. Additionally, people use toll roads because they want a consistent path to their goal.

predict-explain,"Edit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for coupes other than they look cool or may be easier to park in places you wouldn't want to be driving anyways.

Economy coupes used to be a budget choice for younger people who didn't need the space, so auto companies can also save money on two doors. Marginally better gas mileage may be an incentive as well. High end luxury sport car manufacturers can argue that the coupe offers better aerodynamics/lower weight to improve performance and handling.Today, coupes cost the same if not more than the same model sedan. I don't believe a slimmer profile can noticeably improve performance in an economy 140HP car, similarly, I find the fuel economy improvement from 30 to 32 mpg hard to justify the loss of two doors at the same price.

 
Automatic transmission performance used to be inferior to manuals, and an expert could handle a car with manual significantly better than an auto. Today, the highest performance cars come with automatics, and manual often isn't an option anymore. Even in models that offer both, the 0-60 and quarter mile speed is quite a bit better in the automatic, which offers ""manual shifting"" anyways. 

I believe that their long history and inferior counterparts has created a aura of superiority over automatics, similar to the Stradivarius violins. Due to production quantities, a manual transmission costs the same as automatic if not more.

This leaves me with only a few situations where one would practically want a coupe:

High end 400-500+ HP sportscars which accelerate and go fast enough that the profile and marginal weight makes a difference.

And for manual transmission:

Old classic imitation cars for the nostalgia? They're plainly under performing now.

Whenever I see a Bentley or Benz S550/600 coupe, I cringe a bit since they're very obviously not performance based cars. 

Manual freaks who refuse to own any other cars also seem illogical as hell. 

Any thoughts?

* I like how manuals handle much better than automatics. I feel more in control of the car. 

* Manuals can get better marginally better gas mileage on some cars. 

* Another point that is kinda tongue-in-cheek is that not a lot of people know how to drive stick so your car is less likely to get stolen. 

* Engine braking can extend the life on your brakes significantly. 

* Manual ~~engines~~ transmissions are simpler and easier to maintain. 

* Another I forgot originally, You can pop the clutch if your battery dies. (or your alternator is on the fritz)

Honestly, to me, driving stick is much more enjoyable than with an automatic which is why I prefer it.

edit: fixed typos and added last item","Something about a footnote at the the end of your post but delete it?Were you meaning to leave a line for us to copy and paste to show that we read your whole argument before responding?

Anyways:

I prefer manual transmission. I get some people don't like shifting in traffic or whatever, and that's fine for you. But I learned and grew up on one so it really is second nature and makes absolutely zero more conscious effort for me. Benefits of the manual:

- Better gas mileage, no question if you actually know how to drive a stick.

- More control over the car. Going up on down a mountain? Change to the gear you're most comfortable in based on what the slope is doing at the time. Erratic traffic pattern? Pop to a different gear when you need a quick jump to sneak between cars. In the auto the car decides what you need and is based pretty much just on RPM not letting you do those control things.

&gt;I've always felt that homophobia is mainly a symptom of the willingness to hate other groups of people they have never met or gotten to know. 

This is not true, in most cases people's biases are derived from the society and friends/family they grew up with. 

People don't have 'hate' within them that they have to release and just choose different groups of people to be their victims. An individual can be completely nice towards everyone except one group of people and that could be because of what he/she was taught by their family or learnt from the society they grew up in.

I don't believe that people hate just for the sake of hating, there are always reasons behind the way you feel towards some one/group and they are usually 'case-by-case'","&gt;willingness to hate other groups of people they have never met or gotten to know

Unfortunately that is just a very human, universal bias. It is easy to fear or even hate the unknown or different. 

Every humans experiences this bias.

What differentiates people is the ability to DEAL with that emotion. Logical, rational people can overcome this bias.

If anything, Ex-homophobes has demonstrated this ability, so you know they are capable of logically defeating their own bias.

On the other hand if you are looking for people who don't have any biases at all, you are probably excluding the entire humanity.",A,B,"I believe reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B acknowledges the universal bias of fearing or hating the unknown or different, which is a more empathetic approach to understanding where homophobia may stem from. It also highlights the importance of individuals being able to logically overcome their biases, which can be a positive way to view ex-homophobes who have changed their views. This perspective may help the original poster see ex-homophobes in a more understanding light, rather than simply viewing them as still prejudiced or hateful."
predict-explain,"I've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it (""It's the oldest profession""; ""we should have full rights to our bodies"") don't hold up too well, neither do a lot of the arguments against it. **(As a side note, I'll be referring to women but all these arguments could reliably be applied to male prostitutes for the most part)**

One of the most oft-touted arguments that I seem to see is that ""Women will be forced into prostitution because they have no other options"".

I fail to see this as a legitimate concern. Not because I don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because I don't see how this is a bad thing. If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental *and* physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?

If I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because ""Desperate people might feel obligated to work them"", would that make sense? I don't think so. A McJob is a McJob, and a McBlowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. One could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. The only argument I could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which I concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, I'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.

I think a regulated, safe, and well-operated system of brothels (and only brothels, to ensure there are no dangers to streetwalkers/regulations can be easily enforced) would reduce the amount of dangers as well as offer additional opportunities. To clarify, this system would involve:

&gt;Similar regulations to the porn industry (mandatory screening for all workers, 100% condom use by 'johns', provided and required birth control, contracts either requiring abortion/absolving the secondary party of any/all liability and responsibility, physically and financially, in the unlikely event (but by law of large numbers unpreventable) double failure of condoms and birth control.

&gt;Protection, both on and immediately off of brothel grounds, by well-maintained security forces.

&gt;New legislation that ensures any fraud or intentional failure to pay (in the event some brothel didn't take money up front) constitutes rape.

&gt;Harsh crackdowns and harsher penalties for pimping, street walkers, and other institutions (""Massage parlors""). Death penalties/life sentences (where it isn't already) for human trafficking and sexual slavery, all the way down the ladder, and rehabilitation for victims of this.

(Actually, that last one would be good with or without legalized, but whatever).

**What I'd like to see to Change My View (in addition to any logical moral/emotional arguments):**

-Studies on legalization that prove it's not safe/causes societal repercussions more severe than the benefits.

-Studies on lack of effects (or worsening) of street prostitutes/pimp culture.

-Anything else relevant to disprove anything I've said here.

**What I would not like to see:**

-Outright moral arguments (""Selling your body is wrong"", anonymous/casual sex is a sin)

-Any arguments I listed above without additions (""Women will be forced into sex slavery"")

-Religious arguments

Thanks for your time :3

First of all, it's a false equivalency to say that people have a choice between either A) prostitution or B) starvation.   In most western countries, prositition is practically never the *only* option women with limited marketably skills/education have to make money, it just happens to be the most lucrative.  Waiting tables, cashiering, working retail, coupled with a relatively strong social safety net (like foodstamps, medicaid, rental credit/section 8 housing), is how the vast majority of the working poor survive.

It isn't just psychological and physical damage, there's some serious damage to both the immediate incentives and long term prosperity of people, particularly women, that go into prostitution, which are quite destructive.  Lets ignore the psychological damage/addiction cycles synonimous with prostitution and focus instead simple career growth, total earning potential, and the cycle of poverty.  A prostitute's peak earning potential is when they are the youngest and freshest (probably), and gradually dimishes from there.  Lets say a 20 year old can make 200-300 a night, 5 nights a week, that works out to about 50k-70k per year.  Very good income for someone of that age, certainly tough to walk away from considering the expected income of 20-30k, but nothing you can retire off of, and that's their peak income, and it will only go down from there. After 10 years, they're 30, maybe they're still pretty hot, but they can only get 150 a night.  so that means that after 10 years experience, the 45K.  5 years later, they're probably starting to show their age, lets say it drops down to 150.  39k.  Once they hit 40 they're most likely on their way down, if they stay in tip top shape, they could probably still get 100 a night. (even that's kind of generous).  

At what point does the person decide that the money isn't worth it anymore?  Is that point before or after when they feel like they're young enough where they can start their career in something else?  Does someone who go into prostitution hope to work in the same industry until retirement age?  

While it's true that low wage work isn't great, it can lead to opportunities of advancement, promotions and pay raises.  There are virtually zero of these in prostitution.

On the flip side, legal prostitution means higher demand from consumers, leading more people to pay for it, and increasing hte number of people going into as a profession.   While the level of damage each individual would decrease, the number of total damage would increase.

The types of people that choose this type of work would be lower class people with little career perspectives that would make some money for a while, but over the long term, most would be screwing themselves over financially and careerwise in the long term.","Your argument assumes that a person may be faced with a choice between sex work and slow starvation. This isn't true in most first world nations. The social safety net does a pretty good job keeping mouths fed. 

There are exceptions to this of course, but most of them are solvable (husband drinks all the money away) or involve other illegal activity (drug addictions).

So, given that the social safety nets will keep people from starving, what's the difference between legal sex work and illegal sex work? If sex work is legalized, poor people will have to try sex work before welfare becomes available to them. **Poor people will be *expected* to try sex work before they are given relief.**  

""Can't get a normal job? Have you tried prostitution? No? Well, try that, and *then* the government will help you out.""

---

So, who cares? Well, you personally may not think that prostitution is immoral, but *billions* of other people do think that. Legalizing prostitution will mean saying to all those Catholic single mothers ""no, you can't have welfare support unless you're willing to sell your body."" Does that sound acceptable to you?",A,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a detailed analysis of the long-term consequences and drawbacks of legalizing prostitution, particularly focusing on the career growth, earning potential, and cycle of poverty that can trap individuals in the industry. By highlighting the limited earning potential and lack of career advancement in prostitution compared to other low-wage jobs, reply A effectively argues against the idea that legalizing prostitution would provide a viable solution for individuals facing financial hardships.

Additionally, reply A addresses the potential increase in demand for prostitution if it were legalized, leading to more individuals entering the industry and ultimately increasing the overall negative impact. This argument provides a broader perspective on the societal repercussions of legalizing prostitution, beyond just the individual level.

Overall, reply A presents a more comprehensive and nuanced argument against legalizing prostitution, taking into account both the individual and societal implications, which could potentially change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"Hi, I'm new.

So the greeks are complaining about the EU's imposed austerity measures, the terms of their countries increasing debt problems, even going as far as to boycott german goods and compare them to nazi's.

But they *have* been outspending their means, and are lashing out because they have gotten used to their improved quality of life under the euro and are now being threatened with having that QOL decreased.

The alternative to the imposed austerity measures is the country defaulting on its debts and becoming a failed state, and the rest of the EU is taking on a large risk by continuing to loan to a country which over the last 5 years has done nothing but ignore the demands of their creditors and complain about sanctions.

Yes, its the government's fault and not the people's, but they can't reasonably refuse cuts to their public spending that they can no longer afford, and moreover, why blame the eurozone for trying to help, and not their own incompetent government?

I have a lot of objections to that sentence; let's start with the part that is objectively, factually incorrect. Greece *has* implemented the demanded austerity measures for the last couple of years (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis_countermeasures) for all the boring glory). In fact, that's a big part of the problem! Those austerity measures drove the Greek economy deeper into recession, which is largely what increased the Greek debt-to-GDP ratio (after all, when GDP goes down, debt-to-GDP goes up even when debt stays constant).

The Eurogroup position is basically that of a doctor who sees that bloodletting fails to cure the patient, and therefore prescribes even more bloodletting.

For the less factual and more political things wrong with that sentence:

&gt; defaulting on its debts and becoming a failed state

A Greek default does not mean Greece becomes a failed state - look at Argentina for a good example. Of course, if Greece had exited, the rest of the EU may have been pushed by Merkel and Schäuble to start an even more vicious and open economic war against Greece. But let's be honest here: of course a more powerful state can turn another state into a failed state out of spite or stupidity (see Afghanistan in the last 50 years for an example of the latter).

&gt; The alternative (...) is 

There are and have always been other, better alternatives. Years ago, when the first haircut on Greek debt was decided, an investment plan for Greece could have been implemented to grow the Greek economy.

Actually, that would have been the *smart* move by the creditors, because it would have increased the changes that they would get paid back. Now that Greece remained on the course of austerity, it looks as if another haircut will be needed (see the recent IMF reports, for example).","&gt;But they have been outspending their means

The United States government, which holds highest possible bond rating and whose currency is view as the safest in the world, has run a deficit for most of the last 50 years.  There isn't anything inherently wrong with deficit spending, and many economists believe government spending is the best way to lift countries out of recession.

The problem here is that Greece is tied to the Euro.  They cannot simply print more money and increase exports by devaluing their own currency.

&gt;they can't reasonably refuse cuts to their public spending that they can no longer afford

There are good economic reasons to believe that austerity will *not* improve the Greek economy.  While the rest of the Eurozone has climbed out of the recession of the 2008 economic collapse, Greece's GDP has continued to fall as government spending falls.

&gt;why blame the eurozone for trying to help

Their view is that the Eurozone *isn't* trying to help.  The only reason they gave bailout loans in the first place was to keep Spain, Ireland and possibly Italy from freaking out at preemptively leaving the Euro as well.  Now that the danger has passed for those countries, Greece is being bent over backwards, basically being forced out.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a well-reasoned and detailed response to the original post, pointing out factual inaccuracies and offering alternative perspectives on the situation in Greece. The user also provides examples and evidence to support their argument, such as the implementation of austerity measures driving the Greek economy deeper into recession. 

On the other hand, Reply B also makes good points about deficit spending and the limitations of austerity measures in improving the Greek economy. However, it lacks the depth and specificity of Reply A's response, and does not address the factual inaccuracies in the original post as effectively.

The problem is that the other nations will have even less reason to fund someone *else's* financially ruinous and blatantly wasteful Olympics than their own. Like a lot of sporting events it is a prestige thing (which is part of why those corrupt regimes want it), and there isn't a good reason to pay for someone else's prestige. While you would certainly save money with reusing the infrastructure it will still be expensive, as you will need to be maintaining stuff far beyond was is necessary locally between each games. Other countries won't have an incentive to pay for extra blatantly wasteful pageantry and extravagance, so keeping everything sparkly new like currently happens would be unlikely.

It may also hurt the appeal of the games. Won't you please think of the puff pieces?

Is it really?

The Barcelona olympics is credited for transforming a decaying city into a tourist magnet.

The London games were used to develop East London, Vancouver to build infrastructure.  They were successful and the infrastructure benefits have paid for their costs long term, even if they all had a couple unnecessary temporary facilities.  

Beijing *did* do a lot to clean up the city, even if you don't trust their numbers.  The Atlanta &amp; Sydney games are probably a wash in terms of cost/benefit, depending on whom you ask.

&gt;  blatantly wasteful 

That's not to say all have been successful.  Sochi was a mess of epic proportions.  Montreal, Nagano, and Lake Placid were bad too... all of them badly overestimated future tourism and growth of their host cities.

I'm not sure how far back in time you want to go.

The games can be beneficial, and they can be money pits.  It really comes down to management. 

&gt; I think the Olympic Games should be held in Greece every four years

You are aware that the Athens games were among the most mismanaged and over budget ever, right?

&gt;  this would allow Greece to reap the benefits of the economic surplus generated by the Games

I'm not sure we need to further enable Greece to be financially irresponsible and devoid of a real economy.  As it is now, a pretty huge amount of their income comes from tourism.

&gt; Similar to the financial organization of the UN, all International Olympic Committee members should pay according to their ability. 

The UN is an open dialog... and that's about it.  The UN does have increased status (security council, etc) for the top countries that are footing the bill.

The Olympics, OTOH, are mostly a feel good event - but they are a moneymaker.  Keeping them in one location isn't very inclusive or in spirt with the games.

predict-explain,"Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich. However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons:

First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”. Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people’s inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. 

Second of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds. Examples for this are Venezuela or Columbia. 

All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc. However this are minor elements, which I think, should otherwise be implemented in fierce Capitalist society, where in order to succeed you cannot rely on gov. support, but 95 % on yourself.

Edit: I hope this is not too long of an explanation.

It's not supposed to be utopian. It's just ""we have a series of things in our economic system that are really fucked up in many ways, if we did this and that, we end up with a less fucked up system"".

&gt;In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed.

A basic knowledge of Marx tells you that the revolution required an informed industrial proletariat. The examples you give were full of illiterate peasants.

&gt;First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally.

Not how it works. Socialism and communism *mostly* care about the property of the *means of production*.

&gt;That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”.

It's not like Tsarist Russia was better. Also not like Russia with Putin has improved much. Many relevant metrics peaked during the late USSR. But yeah, it was obviously far from perfect.

Funny how you never hear the same ""it doesn't work because we're not perfect"" with capitalism, though.

&gt;All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc.

Those are mere concessions pried with sweat by the workers from the State that oppresses them.","&gt; Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism [...]

Socialism is by no means a precursor to anything, let alone communism. The notion of socialism preceding communism was a Marxist idea, probably propaganda, and is surely false considering the numerous countries that have successfully implemented democratic socialism, for instance: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Australia (formerly) and New Zealand (formerly). One could argue that the United States used to be a democratic socialist country following the New Deal reforms from 1933-38.

&gt; [...] are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich.

Again, be careful not to confuse the very broad concept of **socialism**, encompassing ideologies ranging from social democracy to revolutionary socialism, with **communism**, which broadly encompasses Trotskyism, Marxism-Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism, anarcho-communism and others.

&gt; However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist.

This is incredibly broad and vague, but if you're referring to the collapse of numerous *communist* power structures, then this is probably more often than not due to the undermining of left ideologies through American foreign policy, especially in regard to countries like Cuba. Cuba is also worth assessing since it is a third-world country and still has a higher life expectancy and a more efficient and accessible health-care system than the United States.

&gt; In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed.

Neither Russia nor China were socialist countries. It was their propaganda systems that declared themselves as socialist. For instance, nobody really believes that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is democratic.

&gt; First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally.

predict-explain,"In the early 90s Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved in the ""Velvet Divorce"" into two separate countries: the Czech Republic and Slovakia. I like that they split the name evenly as well.  They divided the national assets by population and want their respective ways.  While there have been some hiccups, by and large both countries are doing fine. 

I think America should undergo a Velvet Divorce of its own.  First the how, then the why. I'd like to focus on why it's a worse outcome than the current course of the country, rather than on the problems with execution (which are admittedly huge).

The How:
Each political party designs a policy platform for their own country.  Everyone votes in a ""primary"" referendum for the various platforms, and the two platforms with the most votes advance to the general referendum. Based on the current U.S. political situation, Democratic and Republican platforms are likely to win top-two. (If we want to do more, we can, but it seems like 3rd parties would still benefit)

In the general referendum, every state holds a vote between the two platforms. The majority decides which country the state will join. 

The likely countries we'll call the ""United States"" and ""America"". These are short-hand for the more liberal/Democratic country and the more conservative/Republican country, respectively. They're likely to look somewhat similar to the last few presidential elections, though with perhaps some defectors in either direction, depending on which country the states see as the real successor to the USA. 

For five years, the government plans and executes the division of itself, the national assets, and national debts by population.  Anyone who wants to move from an area that will be in one country, to an area that will
be in the other, will receive government assistance to move.  (I would predict an exodus of African-Americans from ""America"")

At the end of the five years, the USA is dissolved, its citizenship, currency, flag retired and replaced by those of its successor states. 

The Why:
It's apparent to even casual observers of American politics that The USA is a nation divided, mired in gridlock. The result is a non-functional government in which no one is satisfied and major policy initiatives are tortured into Frankensteinian monstrosities to pass (Obamacare). 

Americans have already begun to segregate themselves politically and we've seen a real deterioration of moderate politicians in both parties, who normally could help bridge the gap and find compromises.  

This stagnation is hurting the USA both at home and abroad. Significant domestic policy challenges are going unaddressed on the federal level (climate change, loss of the middle class, deterioration of transportation infrastructure, tax reform, cost of higher education) and as a result, the USA is losing ground against other countries economically. 

So instead of constantly tripping over each other, screwing up each other's plans, etc, why not divorce?  The ""United States"" can try every left-wing wacko policy it wants, ""America"" can finally do all the nutbag conservative things it wants, and in thirty years, we see which country is the better for it?  Could it really be worse than the partisan gridlock that is dragging the USA down?

Problems with this idea:
There are a lot, so I'll highlight some big ones on the procedure side and the effect side. 

Military:  Each nation would be nuclear-capable and have procedures and armaments the other side is familiar with. This means duplication of key assets (two NORADs, two Pentagons) and that new procedures will have to be developed to ensure neither has the advantage over the other. The ""United States"" might also suffer significance military brain drain to ""America"" due to the average political inclinations of service members. 

World Economy:  The world economy would go into recession as the world's biggest economy divides and both countries struggle with the inherent inefficiency of two economies where there was one.  Especially if either side enacts trade barriers to the other. 

Race to the bottom:  ""America"" would probably remove or reduce labor, environmental, and health and safety laws that are considered bad for business, making it more attractive for capital investment.  This would undermine the ""United States""economy and progressive policies, as companies can get the same workers for cheaper. 

Geography:
""America"" would be continuous and vaguely similar to the Republican ""L"" of the south and midwest, with the ""United States"" split between the west coast and northeast.  This is not conducive to the survival of the ""United States"" as an intact entity, I'm not sure there's a nation that's been divided into two parts that has survived very long.","&gt;  At the end of the five years, the USA is dissolved, its citizenship, currency, flag retired and replaced by those of its successor states.

You've glossed over the absolute biggest deal breaker on the list.  US currency is not measured by a gold standard.  Our currency is based on speculation.  That speculation is almost entirely based on a name/reputation. If the country is dissolved, the currency is reevaluated again.  Upon reevaluation it is impossible for it to divide into even halves.  The different parts synergize to create a result greater than the sum of it's parts.  The division would result in a plummet in both economies.","The problem is that we aren't divided on a nice and neat state level. Have you seen the [Purple America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_America) map? You can have liberal districts (often but not always containing cities) inside of states that strongly disagree with them, or conservative districts (often but not always more rural) inside states that are seen as liberal, and even beyond that things can be close (shades of purple instead of bright red and blue).

So for example Northwest Oregon would want to be part of the ""United States,"" but as soon as you get outside of the Multonomah/Clackamas region and Lane county the state would probably want to be ""America."" This is pretty common throughout the country, with bastions of one side or the other even inside ""strongholds."" What determines how the state goes isn't geographic, but based on how large the populations of the two parts happen to be. The same goes for a county.

If we are dividing at the state level they will end up in the wrong ones, and after some adjustment likely get back to the sort of gridlock we have. If you divide at the district level you will have a total mess, with enclaves surrounded by other countries and going back and forth between two countries ever county line!

So while the current situation might be far from ideal, break wouldn't even be as clean as many of the country breakups have been in the past along historic/ethnic lines that have a strong geographic element. And frankly, even then many of those weren't too clean to begin with.",A,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"Uber is having a very public fight right now with NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, basically arguing that they should be allowed to compete with yellow cabs in a free market and that consumers should have a choice.  I would find this argument much more convincing if Uber weren't exempt from almost every rule and regulation by which the TLC governs traditional taxi services, on dubious legal grounds.  Yellow (and green) cabs in NYC must comply with many rules, including car safety inspections, emissions checks and other environmental regulations, and driver background checks.  Whether you agree with these rules or not (and I certainly have some questions about some of them), the fact remains that they are expensive to follow and that cost is of course passed on to the consumer by the cabs.  


Uber is not competing in a free market at all, in the sense of operating more efficiently to offer a lower price-- they're just gouging their competition by flouting the law.  If Uber (or anyone else) disagrees with these laws (such as the regulation of fares), they can of course use the political process to try to get them changed, but in that case they should be changed for regular cabs also.  There should never be a situation where there is one set of rules and regulations for regular cabs and a separate set for Uber.  


Uber is not and should not be above the law, no matter how cool and ""disruptive"" they might think they are.


**TO BE CLEAR: I am not arguing for or against any particular regulation.**  My argument is that, whatever the level of regulation you favor, Uber and yellow/green cabs should be held to the same standard.

New York City has set an arbitrary cap on the number of for hire vehicles which can pick people up off the street.  This cap does nothing except produce economic rents for those who own medallions, and is fundamentally unfair.

Vehicles which have passed safety inspections, have licensed drivers, and have accurate fare systems should be allowed to pick up passengers.  Right now they are not unless they have a special permit from the government that you can't get because they stopped issuing new ones in the 30s.

The medallion system is stupid and Uber is morally right to flout it.  It should be repealed, and any vehicle meeting health and safety rules allowed to ply the streets for fares.","Taxi's ability to be hailed from the street is what usually separates them from other services, such as, black car services. Uber cars cannot be hailed from the street. Thus they should not be regulated in the same manner as Taxis.

predict-explain,"As a lifelong classical musician, I am absolutely in love with the repertoire of symphony orchestras, opera, and chamber music. I am always trying to think of ways to introduce the music to a wider audience and get more people to love listening to classical music. 

So here it is: I believe that the main reason people don't like listening to classical music as much as other genres is because classical music rarely includes a drum set. 

Definitions I use in this CMV: 

Classical music: not only music from the classical period. I'm using the blanket term to describe any music typically performed by orchestras, or chamber ensembles. What a non-musician would think of as ""classical."" Everything from Bach to Mahler to Bartok to Ives. 

Popular music: not just the narrow genre of ""pop,"" but the broad term to include anything listened to by a more mainstream audience. Could include anything from oldies, to country, to EDM, to metal, and beyond. 

Now to explain my view:

I really don't think there's that much difference between classical music and other genres. 

-Both genres use the same 12 notes. (The exception obviously being microtonal classical music, which even as a career classical musician, sometimes I have a really hard time appreciating. But 99.9% of classical music uses the same 12 notes as popular music.)

-Both use the same basic palette of harmonies and tonalities (major/minor chords, added 7ths, 9ths, etc.). 

-Both have the same basic choices of meters. (4/4 time, mixed meter, etc.)

-Both use many of the same instruments. (Guitars aren't exclusive to popular music, and violins and 'celli aren't exclusive to orchestras.)

-Both contain pieces with text/lyrics, and both genres also contain pieces that are purely instrumental. (A lot of people point to lyrics as the main reason they love certain genres of popular music, but both genres have music with text/lyrics.)

-In the pieces with text/lyrics, both genres use many languages besides English. (Lots of people say they can't understand classical music sung in German, yet they listen to plenty of K-pop or songs in French and don't mind looking up a translation, or they appreciate it for other aspects besides the lyrics.)

-Both genres contain relatively short pieces (3-5 minutes) and longer pieces (10+, or even 60 minutes+). (So the length of composition isn't really a big factor, since you can find both short and long pieces in either genre.)

So those are many of the similarities I can think of. But one thing that's really different between most (not all) classical music and most (not all) of popular music is the fact that the drumset (or electronic beat, or incredibly rhythmic or percussive strumming on a guitar, or vocal percussion, or something that makes a similar sound) keeps really obvious control of the rhythm at all times. It's really hard not to know where the beat is in popular music, whereas in classical music, sometimes the meter is a bit more obscure. 

I think that most people really like feeling their body or mind move in time with the music, and so the accessibility of the rhythmic feel in popular genres is appealing to a wider audience. 

Contrast this to classical music, where sometimes, even to a trained musician, the meter is intentionally less clear. In most cases, the meter may be clear to someone who knows what they're listening for, but still not totally obvious to the average music listener. It gives people less of a rhythmic foothold into the piece, which I contend is the reason that people don't enjoy classical music as much.

To clarify: I'm not coming from a place of thinking classical music is better. I'm not assigning value judgments here, or trying to be an elitist. I'm merely trying to find what I would consider the main differences between classical and popular genres to be. And to me, the lack of a drumset (or other instrument that keeps the meter as a very up-front feature) in classical music seems to be the biggest difference that I can spot. 

One final caveat: In this CMV, I'm mostly talking about listening to music on one's own, like at your house, or on your own iPod. I think the experience of attending a concert of classical music vs. pop music is a really different one. I don't blame anyone that thinks that orchestra concerts can feel a bit stuffy. So while people may enjoy the more energetic atmosphere at a popular music concert, I don't think there's much difference to putting on your iPod while you go for a run and listening to Beethoven vs. the Beatles when you're on your own and not in a concert setting. 

The reason I'd like my view changed: I truly want to know the reasons that most people would have for not loving classical music so that I can address that in my future performance and teaching in the hopes of exposing a wider swath of the population to an art form that I love so much. I truly believe that classical music is universal and anyone can enjoy it. But I need to start by finding out the real reasons that people don't already listen to it. 

The main thing that I think will CMV: 

-Compelling examples of features people like about popular music that are unique to popular music. Not features that are shared between both genres. I really want to find out what makes popular styles uniquely engaging to people in ways that classical music is not. 

TL;DR: Classical music almost never has a drumset to help keep really clear track of the time for the listener. People like feeling rhythmically grounded, and so popular styles are more accessible to a wider audience.

I think a lot of think  you list as differences aren't (it's very easy to feel a ""rhythm"" in most classical music) and most the things you say aren't are (small) differences.

But in the end, I think the answer is *very* simple. 

It's not exclusive to classical music... it applies to *all* music that isn't ""popular"". It's just simply that most people aren't that into music in general and won't put the necessary effort (/time) in to ""get into"" a genre outside their comfort zone... be that something that isn't really *that* different, like Classical, or Blues, or Country, or something wildly different like Noise, or Free Jazz.","Could you be looking at this from the wrong angle? You're asking two completely different things: 1) Why people don't listen to classical music; 2) Is it because classical music doesn't have a drum set?

The way I see it is that most people stick with what they're used to or exposed to at some formative age. I know someone who listened to a ton of classical music because his father used to play it in the house while he was growing up. His dad was very knowledgeable about the composers, artists, etc. and passed that on to his son. I, on the other hand, was exposed to a ton of classical rock (from my friends) when I was growing up. That's still the music that I like the most, and he still likes classical music best. In fact, I didn't get into classical music at all (I'm still a noob) until I watched Requiem for a Dream and got blown away by the soundtrack - Kronos Quartet did an amazing job. Though my friend tried, I was resistant to it because of my own lack of ""training.""

That's how it is with exposure to music. If you show me what's ""popular"" right now I would just stare blankly at the list. The whole Taylor Swift/Nicki Minaj drama meant nothing to me because I don't know a single song by Minaj. So it isn't a matter of the qualities of the music, it's more about exposure and discovery. Classical music isn't a presence the same way pop music is. I think that's what accounts for the difference in popularity.

Great post, by the way. Let me know what you think about my $0.02.",B,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a personal anecdote about exposure to different genres of music based on upbringing and experiences, highlighting the role of exposure and familiarity in shaping musical preferences. The user acknowledges their own resistance to classical music until being exposed to it in a different context, which suggests that it's not necessarily the lack of a drum set that deters people from classical music, but rather their familiarity and comfort with other genres.

Additionally, Reply B emphasizes the importance of exposure and discovery in music appreciation, suggesting that classical music may not be as present or accessible in mainstream culture compared to popular music. This perspective shifts the focus from the specific musical elements to broader societal and cultural factors that influence music preferences.

predict-explain,"Under the assumption that you can consciously alter your wants, it seems to me that the obvious solution to a more peaceful life is to reduce your material wants towards zero.  This would include departing from things as basic to the developed world as air conditioning.  I don't see any benefit to wanting more material goods in life, even though I, unfortunately, still want more than I have.

This is less a moral argument than a practical argument.  If you can reduce your wants to non-material desires, then the material provisions you should require to satisfy those desires should be meager; a pair of shoes, a shirt and pants to walk through park; books to read; etc.; and your life should, therefor, be easier and more free.  

Again, this is under the assumption that you can alter your wants.  Specifically, the capacity to want to want something -- wanting to want to exercise, wanting to want to read more, wanting to want less, etc. -- is the basis of this view point, and I'm curious if anyone has a compelling argument towards actually wanting to want more material goods.

**CLARIFICATION:  My claim is NOT that ""The goal of life should be to reduce your material wants to zero.""**","What about material desires that drive life aspiration.  I want to run and govern a charity to help people.  I don't need anything but the bare essentials for living. But in order to run that charity, I desire a suit to attract people to my cause.

This means healthy food, access to things that promote good health.  I need to read news/books/ things to stay up to date and relevant to support the continuous growth of my charity.  

Basically You can do a lot more with more thing and resources.  Bringing my material desires to zero will accomplish nothing.","Your title and your conjecture say slightly different things. One saying that the goal (end game) of life is to reduce material wants. The other saying that you reduce material wants to obtain a more peaceful life.

I would argue that 
1) there is no ""goal"" in life 
2) a peaceful life is not one that is better

1) The only result of life is death, no matter what moves you make during life, the result is always the same. If you become enlightened before you die, if you become a millionaire before you die, if you climb the worlds tallest mountain before you die, nothing changes about the end result. A goal in itself, would just be one additional ""want"", and nothing more.

2) A peaceful life, would be one without disturbance. This means a life without change, a life without stimulus. The more stimulus and change there are the more chaotic the life and less peaceful it becomes. The state with the least change and stimulus is death, the opposite of life. 

And a want is hardly a quantifiable thing. I want one thing: absolute happiness. How many other wants are going to be piled into making that one want happen? Even if you want a small quantified able thing say a cup of tea in the morning, there are other wants that need to be met to reach that, such as living in a place were tea is available. And then what about when that cup of tea is consumed, do we simply slip into a catatonic state until the desire for the next cup of tea arises?

Wants drive us, and give us purpose. Less wants may in fact make us more peaceful, but I don't think that is necessarily an ideal state.",B,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

I know that some airlines are different like Southwest because they do not have assigned seats. But why don't people relax until their seating zone/group is called when you have a reserved seat?

It's not like the gate person knows that the boarding tunnel is clear or that the previous zone has almost completed been seated.

It just seems more relaxing for everyone to go in a ""just in time"" fashion versus standing in the tunnel, then standing in the plane and trying not to make the person in front of you who is trying to get into their seat anxious.

It's a small thing, but its madness and because we can only fit one lane of people in at a time it seems really inefficient for so many people to be standing around.

Edit: I absolutely don't mean that I would only get up the moment I gave a completely clear line to my seat. That's ridiculous and I'm not coming from a point of laziness. It just seems there's a lot more efficient things the airlines can do to make the process faster.

If you care about getting an overhead compartment for your carry-on luggage, you'd better hope you are boarding early. Any sold out flight is going to run out of room in the overhead compartments long before everyone is on the plane (doesn't matter how large the plane is--this has been true for me for domestic and international flights, from puddle-jumpers, to Airbus A380). There is nothing in the world worse than landing at 2AM after a 5 hour, cross-country flight and having to wait an hour for your bag to arrive at baggage claim. I cringe at the announcement that the flight is sold out and some passengers *may volunteer* to check their carry-on item to their final destination.

If you do not care about the overhead bin, then you are a minority, and you're right that there is no rush to get onto the plane.

So you can start awarding deltas to everyone now.  :)","On crowded flights, the overhead bins frequently fill up.

Addictions have symptoms, like cravings, and withdrawal. Withdrawal can last a ridiculously long time, and can have many detrimental effects. Chemical dependencies are particularly rough for this. You seem to misunderstand how the brain works a bit. It's not like ""oh, I apologize too much, I gotta remind myself not to apologize as frequently"" habit. It's a thing your brain thinks you **need** and will respond as though something has gone very drastically if it thinks its not getting the thing it needs.","There are a few issues here. Firstly there are two main kinds of addiction, psychological and physiological. Psychological addiction is the brain saying ""dude you need this, go get it"", a little like an incredibly strong habit. People with a psychological addiction may suffer withdrawal symptoms, but they are purely psychosomatic. Physiological addiction however is different. It will only occur with certain substances, but once the physiological addiction sets in the body quickly becomes dependant upon the substance, no longer able to function properly without it. Take away the substance and the withdrawal is pretty horrific, seizures, blacking out, sometimes comas or even death in extreme cases.

In both cases once the addiction has set in it is at best difficult and at worst impossible to break the addiction without medical treatment. To call it a disease is a misnomer, but to call it a habit is even less accurate.

As for your first sentence, I consider it wrong on both counts. Firstly because most diseases do disappear quickly with no apparent reason, the person just got better. Secondly (depending on where we draw the line of what is and isn't addiction) breaking an addiction generally requires some form of treatment, albeit not treatment in the same sense that most see it but something more akin to many treatments for mental health issues, though strong physiological addictions do often require drugs and other medical attention.",A,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a more comprehensive explanation of the different types of addiction (psychological and physiological) and the effects they have on the body. It also addresses the misconception that most diseases do not disappear quickly with no apparent reason, which helps to provide context for understanding addiction as a disease. Additionally, Reply B acknowledges that breaking an addiction often requires some form of treatment, whether it be medical or psychological, which challenges the original poster's belief that addiction is simply a habit that can be overcome without assistance. Overall, Reply B provides a more thorough and nuanced explanation of addiction, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."

The laws that exist *explicitly* allow breastfeeding. Not all nudity is the same.

&gt;  I don't think it's too much to ask to handle such things in private. Whether pumping milk, or nursing at home, there are ways of handling these things.

It *is* too much to ask, and that's why these laws exist. Going to a bathroom is uncomfortable and unsanitary. Pumping milk doesn't get everything out, there are transportation (cooling) concerns, and some infants reject the bottle. You can't schedule nursing, so not allowing public breastfeeding relegates mothers to the home.

&gt; No one else is obligated to accommodate public nudity. If it's not ""convenient"" for them, that's all part of the sacrifice of parenthood.

Everybody is obligated to accommodate it because that's the law. If it's not ""convenient"" for you to not stare like a pervert, that's all part of living in a modern society where people accept reproduction.","Many people here have noted that public decency laws often make an exception for nursing, I will try to address why these exceptions make sense to have.

The problem with nursing mothers seems to bee that onlookers might feel uncomfortable in seeing a normally sexualized body part. Since the breast of a nursing mother is shown in a clearly non-sexual context the discomfort at seeing it should be minimized already. On the other hand babies need food regularly, to limit where a parent can breastfeed is also to limit how much time they can spend in public. So from this I conclude that any law against public breastfeeding would harm parents far more than it would benefit onlookers.

You also mention accommodating public nudity, but we already accommodate otherwise unacceptable behaviors in the name of child rearing. We already accept that parents will take up extra space, will discipline their children, and have their children inconvenience others. Since children are integral to society and they are near impossible to bring up without disturbing others we make exceptions for them, letting their parents feed them everywhere would just be part of this tradition.",B,A,"I would say reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more thorough explanation of why exceptions for nursing mothers make sense and why public breastfeeding should be accommodated. It addresses the discomfort of onlookers, the necessity of feeding babies regularly, and the idea that society already makes accommodations for parents in other ways. 

On the other hand, reply A mainly focuses on the fact that laws allow for breastfeeding and the inconvenience of handling breastfeeding in private. While these points are valid, reply B provides a more nuanced and comprehensive argument that is likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially change their view on the issue."
predict-explain,"Same-Sex marriage in the US is one of the ""hottest"" news stories of June, and many people are upset that some politicians (especially democratic ones) have gone from being against same-sex marriage to being for it, with statements often pointing to the (likely true) idea that their stance is based on public opinion. 

However, I don't think we should be denouncing these politicians for changing their views on issues such as this one. We should actually *encourage* politicians to do so, *especially* when they change their views based on public opinion. Is this not a representative democracy? Isn't the whole point of a representative democracy for our representatives to actually *represent* the public's views on issues? 

This isn't a CMV about whether politicians *really* change their views based on our opinion (I've seen the data; often times they act against the majority opinion due to lobbying efforts).  I just think that it's OK *if* politicians change their view based on public opinion. CMV.","It is a politician's job to represent the people, and if the people's opinions change, it's good for the politician's to change as well. It is NOT good for a politician to lie about their beliefs In order to get power, and use their power to enforce their true morals.","The problem is that determine what is the actual opinion of the constituency he represents.

Just because its on CNN or there is a national survey doesn't mean that it reflects the opinion of the people he is suppose to represent.

Surveys or public opinion might not be what the people want their elected officials to do.  People might be concerned about the environment but don't want laws to make it more expensive to drive their current fossil fuel cars.",B,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A emphasizes the importance of politicians representing the people and adapting to changing public opinion. It also highlights the negative consequences of politicians lying about their beliefs for power. This argument aligns with the original poster's belief that politicians should change their views based on public opinion in a representative democracy. 

On the other hand, Reply B brings up valid points about the challenges of accurately determining public opinion and how it may not always align with what the people want from their elected officials. While these points are valid, they do not directly address the original poster's argument that politicians changing their views based on public opinion is a positive aspect of representative democracy. Therefore, Reply A is more likely to sway the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea.
However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from people's discomfort with their own nonconformity and outlying ideas more than from a thirst for truth.

Additional info: I am currently writing an essay on the phenomenon of 'groupthink' so the theme is ripe in my mind.
I showed this sub to a friend of mine who immediately believes the moral statuses quo of Tumblr, including contradicting ideas, and has always seemed to me to have difficulty breaking social norms and thinking for herself. Her immediate reaction was to dismiss all posts she saw as 'stupid' (that'd be the first page of 'hot' at time of posting). This, no doubt, has influenced my view.

I'd like to highlight again that I am excited to have found this sub and I'll be visiting here often. But I'd like to discuss this idea first.

P.S. I'm so meta I post requests for people to change my view about /r/changemyview on /r/changemyview as a critique of /r/changemyview.

While it is certainly easier for this sub to defend popular opinions, they are definitely not the only thing here.   
  
I've been here for a while and one thing that I have learned is that if I ever have an idea that seems normal or bat shit insane I should run it by CMV simply because there is always someone who plays devils advocate. Another thing that I have noticed is that occasionally I'll see a post and think  'What is OP mad?' only to soon find out that there is some logic behind their way of thinking. The vise versa of this has happened as well where I have no idea how something could be argued against only again to be shown that the opposing side has a logical defense too.      
  
However these are things that I have seen. In order you change your view I would encourage you to search for some 'popular' opinions and see how the discussions play out, or just simply browse around for awhile.","I'm primarily a lurker and a fairly new one at that, however, in my time here I've seen the value of CMV fairly quickly. The idea of the sub is not to force people to conform, but rather to provide people with legitimate evidence and logical reasoning that they might not be privy to. 

Additionally, when group think is applied in a logical and critical manner, there is nothing wrong with it. Consider this, if people constantly argue and debate things and *only* change their opinions when presented with solid (logical) reasoning, reasoning which they view as better than their own, the final conclusions reached by the majority of individuals will be the conclusions with the greatest basis in logic and fact. Now, this idea is slightly problematic in that it requires everyone to be logical in their reasoning and to only accept sound arguments. However, this very problem is perhaps one of the reasons reddit, and the internet in general, is a great place for such an activity. As I'm sure you are aware simply from spending time on the internet, people are much less afraid to attack positions aggressively and to present some of their ideals which may normally be less socially acceptable.

I think it is fairly reasonable to conclude from all of this that so long as trolling, fallacies and unproductive behaviors (essentially things against the rules) are: recognized, moderated and, when necessary, ignored or removed, CMV is an excellent avenue for one with an open, yet critical mind to learn a great deal. After all, the brightest minds in the world often take part in think tanks and conferences for a reason.

I apologize for the poor sentence structure and overall layout, I'm half asleep but wanted to submit this tonight so I wouldn't forget....

Overall, reply B presents a more nuanced and well-reasoned argument that is likely to resonate with the original poster's concerns about groupthink and nonconformity."
predict-explain,"It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet.  
  
I've always found them annoying, say you're reading or studying at a cafe and they roar by louder than an invading Mongolian horde. God forbid they stop at a light since now you're stuck listening to that ungodly chortle for a good minute or so.  
  
I'm a single parent now and live by a fairly well travelled road. They wake my baby up consistently, and he has a hard time with his sleeping habits.  
  
It's a choice to make your vehicle that loud, not a necessity. On top of that, the rider or driver does not have to hear his most of his own racket since most of the sound is projected backwards.  
  
These people are assholes. I wish I could wake them up every 15 minutes with their own stupid vehicle.

***EDIT:***   
  
I had no idea this post would get this big and, as much as I'd like to, I can't possibly hope to discuss this with all of you. Thank you to everyone, on both sides of the issue, for your reasoned and very interesting replies.  
  
The argument that got me closest to changing my view was surely that of safety. Other people are saying being loud is not as important for safety as actually driving well on a motorcycle, and this seems to be coming from cyclists as well, so unless I see some sort of peer reviewed study over anecdotal evidence that line of thinking isn't doing it for me.
  
My favorite arguments were those along the lines of ""It's a free country, you're the one that's being inconsiderate by expecting the riders to be silent."" The image of some tatted up Hell's Angel roaring through town and impinging on the hearing of 500 people and then screaming ""IM BEING OPPRESSED"" when someone suggests he tones down the throttle is simply delicious.  A special thank you to everyone who called me a pussy via PM. It's good to know you care so much.
  
I also learned that the sound that irritates so many of us so well is the sound of straight pipe exhausts. Cheers all!  
  
***EDIT 2:*** 
  
/u/ToastitoTheBandito did manage to change my view on this. [Here is the link to his comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bfrve/cmv_people_who_drive_loud_cars_and_motorcycles/csmj6kc)  Thank you Toastito, and thank you for being considerate to others.
  
Just a caveat here, there's a few comments in this thread that highlight the problem with some drivers very well. I'm not gonna call anyone out by name but the gist is that I'm annoyed over a minor inconvenience and I should get over it, people like driving loud cars and they're gonna keep doing it.   
  
I don't think any new parent would call it a minor inconvenience after spending 30 minutes putting a baby to sleep only to be woken up 5 minutes into his nap by a purposely loud vehicle. **But this post isn't JUST about me, or my baby.** These drivers drive past countless people. People who are gravely ill. People who own dogs that will shit on the carpet because they're scared of the sound. Nursing homes. Someone with a migraine headache. People who work the night shift. And all these little acts, each one is a little fuck you from the driver. And all these little fuck yous add up to one huge mega fuck you to your community. **People with empathy get mad at this not just because it inconveniences them but because they know it inconveniences many others as well and the act is seen as grossly disrespectful because of that.**  
  
One PM I got said:  
  
&gt;I drive a loud car. Why? Because I like it.  
  
He doesn't take the time to think, ""How will my actions affect those around me? Is there any chance the thing I am about to do will harm someone, and, if that is the case, should I still do the thing?"" No, this person doesn't give a shit. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the very essence of being inconsiderate. ^and^an^asshole","OP, while there are certainly assholes out there, many with loud vehicles are not. If you and your community feel that they are problems, lobby your local government to legally lower the appropriate noise ordinance and have the police solve the problem. If your community doesn't agree with you, sadly your options are restricted to moving or insulating your home to the level where outside noise does not bother you.

Personally, I drive a loud car (for performance reasons) which I have used to increase my technical skills. I have taken precautions so that my car isn't as loud as it could be (resonators and a muffler), but it can still be loud. Because of this, I am very careful when driving through residential areas and ensure that I drive in a higher gear to limit the noise I make (lower revs = less noise). I live near an area with strict noise ordinances and have never had a problem because I am considerate of others. 

Basically, my point is that I (and others in this thread) am proof that not all operators of loud vehicles are inconsiderate assholes. There certainly are inconsiderate assholes, but a blanket labeling of all those who operate loud vehicles is using the same logic that a racist uses to justify their bigotry. Blanket generalizations are generally fallacious because there is almost always someone who doesn't fit into those generalizations. In this regard, I believe your CMV should be changed to say that people who purposefully aim to disrupt the lives of others by being unnecessarily loud are inconsiderate assholes, because that's taking into account the people who aren't inconsiderate assholes.","I own 3 cars with no catalytic converters and a high flow muffler and one car has no mufflers or anything. The reason I do this is because I am an enthusiast that has cars that are heavily modified. Restricted exhausts also restrict performance, especially on turbocharged cars. Cruising and at idle they are all not that bad, when you get on it they are loud. I don't do this because I'm an inconsiderate asshole, I do it because I like it, and most people modify their cars for their liking. I always drive down my own street at a low rpm because I am considerate of my neighbors. If you live near a busy street you have to live with the noise. People who modify their cars to be loud don't know that you have a baby that's trying to sleep when you're living next to a busy street. You can't expect people to be considerate of you just because you chose to have a kid and live where you do.",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A acknowledges that not all operators of loud vehicles are inconsiderate assholes and provides a personal example of someone who is considerate of others when driving their loud car. The reply also suggests practical solutions, such as lobbying local government for noise ordinances and insulating homes, rather than just criticizing the behavior. Additionally, Reply A addresses the issue of blanket generalizations and encourages the original poster to consider the intentions of those with loud vehicles. Overall, Reply A offers a more nuanced and empathetic perspective, which may be more likely to resonate with the original poster and encourage them to reconsider their viewpoint."
predict-explain,"Before I begin, I would like to point something out. I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. ""That means that marriage isn't as special and you can just drop out freely whenever you want"". I don't see this as a viable argument, because if someone is going to leave, then they have a reason to. Even if its a bad reason, or a really good reason, making the person stay by the threat of losing lots of money and/or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse and cause the couple to fight more and more. 

I see no reason whatsoever why anyone should be able to take legal action if their spouse decides to leave then. If someone leaves a marriage, it means they are unhappy with it, or have lost feelings for the other person. And like I said in my first statement, making the person stay in marriage until a joint divorce is (if ever) made by the threat of the person leaving losing a lot of money and/or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse, leaving 1 or both of the people suffering for years. 

Another reason why this is bad is if one person is unhappy in their marriage, and the spouse is forcing them to stay by means of threatening legal action, will leave the unhappy spouse in a terrible marriage for years, or possibly for the rest of their lives.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","There are many marriages where one spouse has given up his or her career to take care of children. In case of a divorce this person is now at a tremendous financial disadvantage because re-entering the workforce after several years can be difficult. Do you think it would be unfair if you were caught in such a situation without marketable skills?

Also let's say a couple has joint finances and are both working. Should the spouse pursuing the divorce not be entitled to his or her share of the money in the finances?

Additionally, decisions regarding custody of children can be difficult as well and can be considered punitive by some in the divorce process. An even split of custody isn't always a good outcome if one spouse is abusive. If one spouse intends to move, this would put unnecessary strain on children. All of these factors need to be considered in some way.

Ultimately, without such measures in divorce proceedings, a stay at home parent is at a disadvantage and financially will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce. This allows the other spouse to act in any manner he wishes, knowing his spouse will not leave him without great difficulty. Divorce proceeding should not be considered punitive, but should be considered the pursuit of the most just outcome for all parties involved (both spouses and the children). Your argument centers on the fact someone can be caught in an unhappy marriage for fear of losing money/children. But your solution doesn't solve this problem, someone caught in a relationship with an abusive or cheating spouse will have no recourse regarding custody of kids or financial compensation and therefore will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce.","Okay, first, you are buying into the stereotypical myth that one ""loses everything"" in a divorce. This isn't true. What happens is that the assets that were jointly acquired are divided between the two parties. A lot of people are unhappy at having to share with someone they're not having that loving feeling towards. Understandable. But the other person isn't taking everything from them. Yes, there are some acrimonious divorces where there's a bitter battle down to who gets the last fork, but that is the fault of both parties involved more often than not, because they're usually both acting like bitter babies out of hurt and anger and not handling things with any sort of reason or accord. 

Also, you seem to think there's only 1 or 2 reasons for marriages to end. There's MANY. Falling out of love is but one. There's also emotional abuse, physical abuse, cheating, neglect, etc etc etc. If you've invested yourself, not just financially but emotionally as well, and put your everything into it, do you really think the other person should be able to just take whatever they want and walk away?

I like that in some countries you have to be separated for a length of time before you're allowed to divorce, because that time can allow for cooler heads to prevail and things can end without all the fighting. That's not to say it's easy, in the majority of cases, there's going to be some pain involved. But when you can step back and catch your breath, it's easier. 

Now on to the alimony bit, which is what you seem to be confused about. A few facts you seem to be unaware of: First, alimony is NOT automatic. It has to be requested, and then a judge will look at the situation and history of both parties and make a decision from there as to whether or not alimony will be granted and how much. There's about a dozen and a half factors that go into deciding alimony amounts. And there IS a reason for alimony. It is NOT a punishment. It is their to help compensate for unfair economic effects of a divorce. If one spouse sacrificed their career in order to support the other while they pursued their own, or pursued their education, that spouse is put at a distinct disadvantage by a divorce. Alimony levels the playing field a bit. If there's no prenup or other such agreement already in place, the court looks at many factors, like the length of the marriage, the ability of each spouse to earn income, the phsyical, financial, and emotional states of each party, and so many more. Then the amount and length of time the alimony will be paid is decided. 

Also, you seem unaware that marriage is legal contract as well as an emotional commitment. When one party breaks that contract, there's legal ramifications. You cannot make legally binding commitments and just walk away from them...and if you have any integrity at all, you don't make any sort of commitment or promise and then just walk away without expecting to make some recompense. 

And no one is kept in a marriage by these threats you speak of. If they stay because they're afraid of divorce, that's their own choice and they're making themselves miserable. The courts will divide the assets, not the spouses, and there will be some losses for both sides. That's how life works. When you build something together with another person, you don't get to just take all the marbles and leave when you decide you don't want to play any more. You BOTH contributed, and you BOTH stand to lose some of what you built.",B,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a more comprehensive and nuanced explanation of the reasons behind divorce laws and the potential consequences of not having them. It addresses specific scenarios, such as stay-at-home parents being at a financial disadvantage after a divorce, the importance of fair division of assets, and the complexities of custody decisions. 

Additionally, Reply A acknowledges the potential for abuse or neglect in a marriage and the importance of providing legal recourse for individuals in such situations. It presents a more empathetic and understanding perspective on the challenges faced by individuals seeking divorce.

In contrast, Reply B focuses more on dispelling myths and misconceptions about divorce, which, while informative, may not directly address the concerns raised by the original poster. It also comes across as more defensive in nature, rather than seeking to genuinely engage with the original poster's viewpoint. 

Overall, Reply A provides a more thorough and empathetic argument that is likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially change their view on the topic."
predict-explain,"I mean all jobs, such as police officers, military personnel, CIA operatives, security clearance applications, teachers, lawyers, and doctors. Some of these professions will outright ask on the application if the person has a mental illness. Some people will say that certain professions are so important, that a person with a mental illness should be denied. But people who advocate discrimination against the mentally ill are simply misinformed about the fact that mentally ill people have the same rights as everyone else. While the media portrays mentally ill people as violent, this is simply not true. Mentally ill people are no more violent than the average person.

Realistically, these are people who have stressful jobs and they don't know when or if they're going to face a violent criminal who might have a deadly weapon when they go to work every day and of course they're going to make the occasional mistake as it is. I think you mentioned training in other replies, but eventually the man with a mental illness is going to run up across a situation that hasn't been covered in training and that's when he might have a meltdown.","You are misinterpreting training as a guarantee that someone can do the job well. Plenty of people can pass tests, go through courses, etc and still have issues down the line. All that initial training and testing is to weed out people who are obviously not qualified and ensure there are standards of basic knowledge/skills employees possess to do the job properly. Judging someone solely on such a short sighted and narrow view of their qualifications is simply not smart decision making, especially when others people's lives are at stake. 

And your definition of ""mentally ill"" simply isn't well developed enough to really be able to change your view on the issue. What disorders are you including? How can you make a meaningful statement about how violent they are if you are lumping a bunch of disorders together? Why are you only considering rate of violence when plenty of other issues that mental disorders could bring about would effect job performance.

Also you need to realize that we are not all equal from a performance standpoint. In the real world, we have different abilities to handle stress, perform under time constraints, etc. The issue is not whether someone can pass a test or qualification on a single day, it is can they repeat the same task everyday with little to no error. Someone with a mental illness may have more variation in performance because it is simply another variable taking away from one's ability to do a stressful job well.",B,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more nuanced and detailed explanation of the potential issues that can arise when considering individuals with mental illness in high-stress professions. The user points out that passing tests and training does not guarantee that someone can do the job well in the long term, and that the focus should be on the individual's ability to consistently perform the job with little to no error. Additionally, the user raises important questions about the specific disorders being considered, the potential impact on job performance beyond just violence, and the variability in performance that may arise due to mental illness.

Overall, reply B provides a more comprehensive and thoughtful argument that takes into account the complexities of the issue, which could potentially lead the original poster to reconsider their views on the topic."
predict-explain,"There's a federal law which prohibits anyone from buying a vote or paying someone to withold their vote, or accepting anything for a vote. The spirit of this law is that the vote should be your own, informed choice, rather than letting someone else make the decision for you.


Point 1 - http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-verification-without-id-documents.aspx
The ncsl site details some terribly inefficient and time consuming ways to verify someone's identity without an ID. Time needs to be used to look up data and then more time needs to be spent comparing data. And then more time after that when things dont match up and you have to fix / argue your want through.

Point 2 - I have trouble understanding the argument about how requiring IDs to vote is discriminatory in a bad way. The argument is that requiring an ID would discourage poor people from voting. Even the poorest citizens engage smoking and drinking, which are activities that they probably have been asked for an ID for. I find it inconceivable that someone without an ID would be someone capable of making an informed vote. If you couldn't find the time out of all the years in your life and maybe 10 dollars to get an ID, then I believe that you are the exact type of irresponsible person who should not be voting at all.

Point 3 - There are long lines at voting and requiring IDs would cut it down. The government requires employers to pay workers while they take off to go vote. I can think of many employers who will tell you to take the whole day off rather than pay you a full day for half a day's work. This is a partially broken law which only works for full time employees. Part time employees, which generally make less money, often cannot take advantage of this. I'd make the argument that by not requiring ID's to vote, they are discriminating against people whose time is more valuable than voting. I believe the best way to encourage voting is to make voting easier and less time consuming. 

Point 4 - Perhaps instead of trying to tackle enormously expensive projects like free healthcare and free college, we can start with the easy and low cost / high benefit ones like free ID cards.","You have a major unrecognized assumption. You assume that it is as easy as going down to some place and paying $10 to get an ID. If you do not have an address (that is, very poor) it is essentially impossible to get an ID. If you don't have a birth certificate, which is more likely if you are poor, (not born in a hospital, parents didn't keep good track of it, house burned down, got robbed, etc,) it is very difficult to get one, and essentially impossible to get any other ID until you do. 

These same factors are also one of the huge obstacles to escaping poverty. I have always wanted someone to film an experiment where they pretend their ID, cell phone and home don't exist, and try to get government assistance or a permanent job, because it seems largely impossible.","At the moment, in most states, the requirement to vote is to fill out a card asserting you are eligible.  It is up to the state to show that you are not eligible.  The burden of proof is on the state to prove whether you are or are not eligible.

With a mandatory voter ID, you've moved the burden of proof onto the citizen to prove that they are eligible to vote.  They have to have proof of a birth certificate, social security card, utility bill, or some other form of proof.  With elderly or poor people, they may not have these documents available, and voter ID has passed the burden of proof onto the voter.

Having or not having an ID doesn't make a significant difference in voting lines.  At least in my experience, the bottleneck is almost always the booths themselves, not the sign-in portion.  If you want to make voting more accessible, move to a 24 hour voting period.  I think that would be even better than declaring voting day a holiday - if you run elections from 7 PM to 7 PM or whatever, then even part-time workers with multiple jobs should have some time to vote.",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This reply provides specific examples and scenarios that highlight the difficulties that some individuals, particularly those in poverty, face when trying to obtain an ID. It also brings up the larger issue of systemic barriers that prevent individuals from escaping poverty. These points challenge the original poster's assumption that obtaining an ID is a simple and easy process for everyone. Reply A's argument is more persuasive because it addresses the root of the issue and provides a compelling perspective on the challenges faced by marginalized communities."
predict-explain,"Now in the spirit of fairness - I believe this to be true for all governments, but in this case I'll touch upon the U.S. gov.

First of all [Lusatania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania#Undeclared_war_munitions) the U.S. government deliberately loaded a civilian ship with munitions, so that the German can sink it and the population be dragged into a war they wanted nothing to do with.

Second - [Gulf of Tonkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident#Later_statements_about_the_incident) where the government lied about  engaging enemy targets, in order to stimulate the population into supporting the Vietnam War. 

Third - [Nayirah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah) testified before congress to encourage U.S. into entering the Gulf War

Forth - [MKUltra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra) is a thing.

After this, how can anyone trust the government in any way? It's insane to give it more power.","Yeah, the American government also played an instrumental role in abolishing slavery forever. I don't know how many Lusitanias and MKUltras it would take to add up to the sum weight of all the human lives and misery spared over the last 200 years due to ending slavery, but I'm pretty sure it's a lot. Like a *lot* a lot.

Like many others here have said, it's easy to find a bunch of negative examples of things the gov't has done -- but if you're going to insist on going full-blown Utilitarian about it, the net effect would come out overwhelmingly positive pretty much no matter how you slice it.","Because the list of things the government has done right is a lot longer.

The government should be treated with skepticism and wariness, but you have a road in front of your house, electricity powering your tv (which gets television shows and avoids bursting into flames whenever there is lightning), you are not constantly the victim of crime, you don't have to pay bribes to local strongmen, and a billion other little things work because of government intervention.",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B acknowledges the negative aspects of the government but also highlights the positive aspects and benefits that government intervention provides in everyday life. By pointing out the practical benefits and improvements that government involvement brings, Reply B offers a more balanced perspective and could potentially help the original poster see the value in trusting the government in certain aspects."
predict-explain,"I think its fair to say that most people dont give a single shit about morality unless they're driven by compassion/""their conscience"" or worried about being judged by others for doing the wrong thing. 

So people eat meat because 

* Most people wont judge them for it

* They have no compassion for the animal

I feel compassion for animals and so I dont contribute to their mass-abuse and slaughter, aside from the obivously immoral support of animal cruelty there's a bunch of reasons why vegetarianism is better for the earth, for your health etc, but until I gained that compassion it didnt matter to me.

People like to act like their decision to eat meat is some kind of well thought-out position that they're sure is logically and morally sound, but IMO its 100% backwards rationalisation. They already made the decision to eat meat as a child without thinking about it at all, and they want to keep doing it so they try to explain to themself why they do it instead of honestly thinking about whether or not they actually should.

Eating meat can never be more or as ethical as not eating meat, because you're taking life needlessly and contributing to/causing (no snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible) all kinds of abuse towards animals. But people just dont really give a shit.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","I eat meat and care very much for morality. I was a vegetarian for many years for the usual reasons: not approving of the horrible ways the animals are often treated in industrial meat production, wanting to avoid the environmental impact of industrial farming, etc.

Although there were other factors involved as well, I started eating meat again because I accepted that:

1) By choosing to eat meat that is hunted by myself or someone I know, raised by someone I know, or raised free-range on grass from a company I trust, I take ownership of how the animal is being treated and help create a market for ethically-raised meat.

2) Many of the protein alternatives that vegetarians consume are actually as destructive to the environment as ethically-raised meat or worse. Soy production, for example, is extremely problematic.

So, yes, I care very much, but came to the conclusion that becoming a total vegetarian was not necessary within my morals.","While I agree that a lot of people opinions towards eating meat is basically 1. i was raised eating mean 2. meat is delicious 3. i dont care much for animals 4. there are plenty of people who don't care therefore i eat meat. i personally had thought about it and i could not find a way to justify not eating meat.

killing animals can not be immoral, because morality is a manifestation of a system of behaviour which maximises a persons chance of survival and reproduction. a person does not steal because doing so will piss other people off and make enemies. the same is true of killing. and because humans are social animals, it is very important to not piss other people off because the long term benefits of cooperation with others greatly outweigh the short-term gain. so one can not extend said morality system to animals, because man does not need to not kill animals in order to use animals, and because animals can not reciprocate whatever moral system that a human might subscribe to. an animal does not have an idea of ownership, pets will steal food from your plates, and animals will kill and eat you in the wild. 

as for the health reason, well, any nutritional study shows that SOME meat is beneficial. while the largely meat-based diet of modern USA is clearly bad, some meat is clearly good, so for me, i would eat more vegetables and fruits than meat, but i would still eat meat.",A,B,"I believe that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a thoughtful and nuanced perspective on the issue of eating meat, acknowledging the concerns about animal welfare and environmental impact while also presenting a different approach to addressing these issues. The idea of consuming ethically-raised meat from known sources or hunting it oneself is a way to take ownership of how the animals are treated and support a market for more humane practices. Additionally, the point about some protein alternatives being equally or more harmful to the environment than ethically-raised meat adds complexity to the discussion.

On the other hand, Reply B takes a more absolutist stance on the issue, arguing that killing animals cannot be immoral and basing this on a utilitarian perspective of morality. While this argument may have some merit, it lacks the consideration of the ethical concerns raised by the original poster and does not offer a solution or alternative approach to addressing those concerns.

Overall, Reply A provides a more balanced and nuanced perspective that is more likely to challenge the original poster's views and prompt them to reconsider their stance on eating meat."
predict-explain,"This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes... we've gone way overboard with this PC/Social Justice mentality.

Recent examples are-

-the furor this morning (at least on twitter) over Amy Schumer in the WaPo. http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/06/dont-believe-her-defenders-amy-schumers-jokes-are-racist/

-Hannibal Burress had a minor run-in with several notable female twitter personalities including Gaby Dunn. https://twitter.com/hannibalburess/status/618179591140564992 (there's a whole list of responses, if it doesn't show up just go through his timeline)

-Jerry Seinfeld made news when he said he wouldn't play college campuses anymore, to much reminding of his relationship with a 17-year old twenty years ago, and snickering over how his material isn't even edgy anyway. http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/10/living/seinfeld-comedy-colleges-feat/

-Chris Rock said the same thing last year. I guess he's a shitlord too. http://www.vulture.com/2014/11/chris-rock-frank-rich-in-conversation.html

-Patton Oswalt, who at one point was booed in Philly for his anti-Bush beliefs back during 2004 or so, is now not worthy of being followed. He's in a category with Trump and Palin. http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/patton-oswalt-twitter-troll-unfollow/

-Not to pick on Gaby Dunn, but earlier this year she blew up at Josh Groban, because I guess young male celebrities being horndogs is completely new and has never, ever happened in human history. https://storify.com/amandataylor88/don-t-fall-for-this-famous-guy-s-flattery

Hell, even amongst the more notable far-left twitter there's infighting. Suey Park and Lauren Chief Elk are going at it over DMs to an ex/stolen laptops https://twitter.com/suey_park/status/617747933987889152

And depending on who you believe, Rania Khalek is anti-black http://bad-dominicana.tumblr.com/post/87992874258/rania-khalek-such-an-antiblack-piece-of-shit-like or ""bad_dominacana"" is racist against Arabs https://twitter.com/raniakhalek/status/514920026236018688.

I was, am and will be a dyed-in-the-patchouli liberal. I was ecstatic that gays can get married now. I will call Caitlyn Jenner whatever SHE wants me to. I'm a big fan of Bernie Sanders. I absolutely believe all fortysomething of Bill Cosby's accusers.
That said, I'm starting to feel a little lost. I cringe when I see the word ""thinkpiece."" I hate that people get so caught up in a perpetual outrage machine and so high off their own self-righteousness they will destroy a life like Justine Sacco's (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html?_r=0) for sport. (Also, how great is Sam Biddle for basically admitting he'd do it all over again for ""the clickz?"") I have to believe that the right or, ""The Man,"" are absolutely loving this infighting. Endless digital ink is spilled on Black Widow in The Avengers while cops are still shooting anyone with a skin tone darker than Burnt Sienna.

Am I wrong? Am I the asshole here? Is all of this of vital importance? Will the 24/7/365 internet analytical news cycle bring us to the promised land? Or is this just a tool of cultural commentators on a deadline?

EDIT:  I'll add this since I'm getting a lot of advice to get off twitter.  I definitely don't go on as much as I used to, but it's hard for me to stay off completely for two reasons.  One, there's a lot of actually good, funny twitterers out there.  It's also a good news source, it's how I found out we got Bin Laden.  Two, as someone who, despite all warning signs, wants to be involved someday in the comedy/entertainment biz, it's kinda necessary for those on the come up to use it as a promotional tool.  If I was Spielberg or Tarantino I'd get the hell off, trust me.  But I'm a nobody from nowhere at the moment.

Try not to focus on the Twitter thing as much.  There's pieces on Gawker, WaPo and Daily Dot that I've used for examples.  Here's a piece on the AVClub where the writer complains about female fans of Captain Marvel for... reasons.  Not sure.  They're problematic somehow.

http://www.avclub.com/article/marvel-learned-wrong-lessons-carol-corps-218003

EDIT 2:  Not sure how much longer this'll stay active, or how much I'll be able to check in tomorrow so I'll do a pseudo-wrap up here.  I used mainly examples from the comedy world and Twitter since that's what immediately came to mind.  Other examples I could've used were Donglegate (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/) and ScientistShirtgate (http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/11/18/scientist-shirt-feminism-comet-your-say/19248543/).  I think those two, and there are others, are also worthy of discussion in that they involve nuance.  Someone like Donald Trump, that's a black-and-white case of racism.  

Someone in the comments said this seemed like neurotic hand-wringing by an alienated individual, and that could very well be the case.  I didn't really spend a whole lot of time making a comprehensive essay about this because a-it's just reddit and b-I posted from the gut with immediacy.  If someone wants to take this theme and do it up better, by all means go for it.  I never claimed to be a social scientist.  Or even just social.

Some good opinions here, with the major consensus being that these things seem big and important on the internet where everything is a hot take and people are either Lawful Good or Chaotic Evil with no in-between.  So in stepping out from the cyberspace will keep the perspective in check.

Good talk everyone!  No name calling or trolling!

Besides something ""exploding"" on the internet often being barely a ripple to most people who aren't immersed in that specific subsection, 140 characters is not enough for nuance and can often make twitter slapfights even worse than they are. Often in the longer pieces, when someone criticizes something someone does, it doesn't mean that person is accusing the subject of being ""Trump or Palin"" or ""a shitlord"" or whatever.

For example, you said:

&gt;Patton Oswalt, who at one point was booed in Philly for his anti-Bush beliefs back during 2004 or so, is now not worthy of being followed. He's in a category with Trump and Palin

But lets look at the article:

&gt;In the end, it may just be a matter of medium. What makes Oswalt’s comedy sly, surreal, and subversive “in real life” makes it a lightning rod for denunciation on Twitter. I can understand, if just barely, why he might get a kick out of that—but not why anyone else would.  

The whole piece is super, super positive towards Oswalt as a comic. It is just arguing that his needling of twitter is a ""shooting fish in a barrel,"" and not really adding anything to the conversation nor does he find it particularly funny, and so his is unfollowing him (despite, again, really liking him as a comic).

Similarly, in the piece on Amy Schumer:

&gt; Schumer herself has shined a spotlight on rape culture, misogyny and sexism. But when it comes to race, she betrays this tradition.

Nothing about her being terrible overall, just criticizing this small facet of her work.

I'm not going to try to argue about overall trends, it is just too vague and I'm not big into this specific scene to break apart a pile of different arguments. However, I would argue that going immediately from ""pure PC"" to ""shitlord"" is not what is happening, and that sort of black and white thinking can be part of the problem of the internet hate machine (whichever direction it is pointed today).","A lot of comedians love to blame political correctness for their waning popularity rather than actually getting with the times and making new funny jokes. People have changed, edgy jokes just aren't as funny to the new generation as they were to your parents generation. Jokes aren't objectively funny. People used to find Minstrel Shows hilarious, now we don't. Is that ""political correctness gone mad?""

On the other hand, we've also gone way overboard with the *reaction* to political correctness. Look at how angry people are in the GamerGate movement over something so trivial. This isn't unique to one side, outrage is just much easier to find and amplify in the digital age. If you're a political commentator looking for a boogeyman to hate on and generate clicks, you can easily find one person who says dumb things on some obscure blog and capitalize on that. So don't fall for the conservative narrative that political correctness and PC is going mad and that they're the only logical ones calling it all out. They're responsible for doing the exact same thing and are the ones who give it so much importance in the first place.",A,A,"I would say that reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a more nuanced and balanced perspective on the issue at hand, highlighting the importance of not taking social media interactions too critically and pointing out the potential lack of nuance in Twitter discussions. By breaking down specific examples mentioned by the original poster and showing that the criticism is not as extreme as initially perceived, reply A encourages the original poster to consider a more nuanced view of the situation.

Reply B, on the other hand, focuses more on criticizing comedians for blaming political correctness for their waning popularity and highlighting the overreaction to political correctness. While these points are valid, reply B does not directly address the examples and concerns raised by the original poster, making it less likely to change their view on the issue."
predict-explain,"I definitely realize a lot of harm can come from poor examples of cultural appropriation. Often my idea of bad appropriation was the Christianizing of many pagan holidays/traditions by the church to get the pagans of europe joining up with them. 

But my particular case seems a lot different. Yes I am a dominant race type (being white) and I am seriously considering getting a tattoo based upon textiles and patterns used by the Incan Civilization during their peak. Specifically, it would be a sleeve only representing the vibrant colors and geometry that the Inca use. I'm getting it for a few reasons:

* Aesthetically it is very pleasing to me

* I hold a lot of respect for what their civilization accomplished, and would like to ""advertise"" them more through body art

* I may possibly incorporate their symbols for the sun, their main focus of focus worship. Although nonreligious myself, I respect that worshiping the material sun and nature around us is an important trait more of us should take note of. 

This still seems to be textbook cultural appropriation, but is it immoral for me to do so? If I believed this could truly degenerate the Incan culture or offend many rational minds, then there is no way I'd go through with this plan (that just isn't the type of person I am). So, please, change my view if there is something I may be missing here.

If, however, you are inspired by those designs and incorporate some of the aesthetics and styles into your sleeve that is different. Then you are only saying ""Hey, I like this aesthetic style"". 

Mohawks are a perfect study of this. Yes, there is a Mohawk tribe of Iroquois. But the strip of hair down the center of the head with clean shaven sides is not specific to that culture, or even common within it. It just became synonymous with that tribes name because white people choose to ignore inconvenient things like ""facts"" when creating style and entertainment. 

So now we're stuck with the name along with lumping all of the native tribes in the Americas together as ""Indians"", the Irish drunk stereotype along with countless other examples or inappropriate appropriation and misleading but interesting factoids. 

So for things already in the general public's consciousness.. yeah. There is a whole lot of appropriation that is going on that we actually know is wrong.. but people are loathe to change their terminology etc. and it's generally fairly neutral compared to other issues facing an appropriated community. Neutral in terms of direct impact. Still not necessarily right... but tolerable. Sometimes... it's a really really grey area that anybody can justify whatever they want inside of to be honest. 

So into that broiling frothing mix you want an Incan Tattoo. Not ignorantly, like a kid who hasn't been taught about WW2 saying they want a tattoo like their Jewish great grandmothers. But willfully and knowingly. 

If you are Incan, have Incan Anscestry or had the tattoo offered by an Incan tribe as a sign of repect and thanks... that would be fine. 

But you really just like the look. 

So make the aesthetics your own without co-opting the meaning behind them. Think about the things that are important to you and use your own designs and interpretations to express your life. Where you have been, where you are, and where you are going. Then if you still want to use that aesthetic as a template you at least aren't stealing other peoples experiences and claiming them as your own. Some would still claim that doing that is too much cultural appropriation. But yet they won't burn their Beatles records... Hypocrites...","Usually cultural appropriation is harmful when people choose to utilize, or ""appropriate"", positive elements while ignoring or leaving behind more unpleasant elements. For example, white suburban kids listening to Gansta Rap and wearing do-rags while not having ever (or will ever) experience the specific circumstances that led to those becoming relevant icons in the Black community. Or, more recently, white people wearing headdresses to music festivals (or getting them tattooed on them). Headdresses are, in many Native American cultures, a very sacred and symbolic motif used for specific practices and people. White people who wear them are choosing to ignore the negative parts of Native life and cherry-pick aesthetics. I can go more in depth but that's not the point.

You are interested in ""appropriating"" from a culture that hasn't had a lot of presence since the 16th century. Though I'm sure you could find an Incan descendent somewhere with an issue there, I doubt you will run into many of them. However, I wanted to address two points:

1. Aesthetics

This is the primary argument used by people who want to utilize symbols or costumes from other cultures. You understand this is not generally considered a way of ""honoring"" the culture, but picking pieces you think are ""pretty"" with very little regard for their weight or history? Usually, when discussing cultural appropriation in an academic string, this has no weight.

2. ""I may possibly incorporate their symbols for the sun, their main focus of focus worship. Although nonreligious myself, I respect that worshiping the material sun and nature around us is an important trait more of us should take note of.""

Let's say it wasn't the Incan culture, and it was Hindu. You admit to not being religious, but like certain aspects of their religion, which they probably take very seriously and personally. Do you see how this could be seen as trivializing, white-washing, and ""appropriating"" something that you admittedly don't follow in your own life? It's like saying ""Native Americans worship nature"". 

3. I hold a lot of respect for what their civilization accomplished, and would like to ""advertise"" them more through body art

Do you think people don't know about the Incan civilization? Or are you attempting to create solidarity between you and those of Incan descent? Sorry, I don't really understand this point.",B,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a more in-depth analysis of the potential issues with cultural appropriation in this specific case, highlighting the importance of understanding the weight and history of the cultural symbols being used. It also brings up the point of trivializing and white-washing aspects of a culture that one does not personally follow, which could help the original poster reconsider their decision. Additionally, Reply B questions the intention behind ""advertising"" the Incan civilization through body art, prompting the original poster to reflect on their motivations. Overall, Reply B provides a more thorough and thought-provoking response that may lead to a change in perspective for the original poster."
predict-explain,"The expense of a higher education has been a hot button issue for a number of years but the fact that students take on huge loans and graduate with huge sums of debt is a function of their own suboptimal decisions.

Assuming the worst case and a student pays full sticker price, that's around 125k in debt. But with almost all private schools, there are plentiful scholarship and grant opportunities. Even for students who support themselves (meaning no financial help from their parents), these options make the 125k number far less. This forgets the fact that according to the same source, students can attend an in-state university for just shy of 10,000, for a far more affordable (and worst case) of 40k. And this is without considering alternatives to college.

Because while I would agree that there is likely some exaggeration, for many people it is completely unaffordable. Not everyone gets the best case scenario, and if you make less than $30000 a year, then paying minimum of a third of a years pay on education is not feasible.


&gt;And this is without considering alternatives to college.



And I don't know how considering alternatives to collage is an argument for the affordability of collages; yes collage is cheep if I do not go to it and take an apprenticeship instead, but I don't know what it would have to do with this discussion.","My family made ""too much"" for FAFSA aide but too little to afford me much assistance with college prices.  I went to a school where I was given a full academic scholarship, which included room and board.  In order to afford additional fees / books / transportation I still had to take out a Stafford loan every yeah.  On top of that, the government decided that the room and board part of my scholarship qualified as ""income"", and I then owed the IRS money come tax return time for each of my four years.  I'll still be paying off these loans for a few years. 

My point: Even with the ""best case scenario"" of a full scholarship, college still poses a significant financial burden.",A,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a personal anecdote that highlights the financial burden of college even with a full scholarship. The user explains how they still had to take out loans and ended up owing money to the IRS, showcasing the hidden costs and financial struggles that can come with pursuing higher education. This personal experience adds a human element to the discussion and may make the original poster reconsider their stance on the affordability of college. Reply A, on the other hand, focuses more on general arguments and does not provide personal insights or real-life examples to support their point."
predict-explain,"This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation i have come to.

The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) is a sign of human weakness in a couple of ways. 

The need for an afterlife in most religions satisfies our general fears of death, and the impermanence and futility of our lives. The theory isn't backed by much scientific evidence as far as i know, so the reason to believe in an afterlife isn't that it makes more sense but that it makes life easier. A fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that i would categorize as fairytale. This is what i would call a weakness. 

The need for moral guidance in life - to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong. Furthermore, the need of a consequence by eternal damnation as persuasion not to do ""bad things"", and the need of an incentive by eternal salvation to do good. Is a sign of weakness in that it shows that human-nature is bad, or barbaric in a sense.


EDIT: Keep the comments coming guys - ""i'll secede on that point - ""moral guidance"" is not evidence for human weakness. But a motivation to believe in a creator.""

A fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that i would categorize as fairytale. This is what i would call a weakness. 

So things that make life easier make you weaker?

That's incorrect. Humans have a limited attention span. Making things easier allows you to better focus on important tasks.

&gt;The need for moral guidance in life - to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong.

So you're saying that learning how to behave from elders leads to you being weaker?

That's also incorrect, humans are much more effective with teaching and aid from adults.

&gt;Furthermore, the need of a consequence by eternal damnation as persuasion not to do ""bad things"", and the need of an incentive by eternal salvation to do good. Is a sign of weakness in that it shows that human-nature is bad, or barbaric in a sense.

So here you're saying artificially produced reward and punishment schemes are unhelpful and demonstrate barbaric behaviour?

Also incorrect, humans are rational intelligent beings and it's fairly normal for them to create artificial incentive structures to aid proper behaviour, like golden stars for doing well at class, or setting artificial goals like having a bookshelf of a favorite author.

None of your stated weaknesses are actual weaknesses. There are religious groups with genuine weaknesses like jehovah's witnesses who refuse to take blood transplants, or the Hindu practice of followers of the Vishnu Smriti burning widows, but vague non weaknesses don't mean much. If a weakness leads to physical harm then it's a bit more serious, but vague emotional ones mean little.

There are many practices of religious people that humans in general do. Religious people speak. This isn't a sign of their weakness at nonverbal communication. Religious people exercise. This isn't a sign they are wasting calories. Religious people read. This isn't a sign of their lack of sociability. These are all common human traits that aren't weaknesses.","&gt;The need for an afterlife

&gt;The need for moral guidance in life

Doesn't the fact that not all humans 'need' these indicate that it isn't a 'human weakness' (if it is indeed a weakness)? Also, aren't coping mechanisms generally considered a strength, rather than a weakness? With the afterlife, for instance, the fear of death might be a sign of human weakness, but the ability to surmount that fear is a sign of strength and resourcefulness, isn't it?",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A effectively counters each point made by the original poster with logical arguments and examples. It points out that making life easier does not necessarily make one weaker, and that seeking guidance from religion or elders is a common and effective practice. Additionally, it challenges the idea that the need for consequences or rewards in religion indicates weakness, arguing that humans often create incentive structures for proper behavior.

Before you ask us why you don't think another republican can win, you should really take a look at yourself first. You've likely surrounded yourself in an echo chamber.

I present 2 reasons why the Republicans are still going strong:

1) Young people don't vote. The showing for elections is pitiful, but especially among young people. And demographics show that the older you get, the more likely you are to vote. This is even more evident when the elections get smaller - when was the last time you voted for city commissioner? Probably never. But your grandma has in the past 5 elections.

2) Some people don't care about those things, and care about other things instead. The most obvious example is economics. Conservatives favor policies which are more favorable to business and economic growth than liberals. They support lower taxes, less regulation, and fewer worker's rights. If you are involved in running a business, or realize that you might lose your job (even your shitty, underpaid job) if your business loses its competitive edge, you will care far more about keeping the economy going strong than whether or not two men can get married in Nevada.","I'm a young, college educated, conservative in a democrat heavy state. The flaw in your position that I see is [issue salience](http://sppc2014.indiana.edu/Papers/Bromley-Trujillo%20et%20al.pdf). People care about certain issues more than others and give greater weight to those when comparing candidates. If social issues don't feature prominently in an election, i.e., we talked about the economy, foreign policy, energy policy, etc., voters are likely to make their decision on other issues and choose a candidate who they disagreed with on social issues. The state of the economy is of far greater concern to most voters than marijuana legalization for example. Abortion tends to be the biggest exception to this, since most people tend to have strong views on the subject and for many voters it is a must-agree issue.  

Republicans can in my view definitely win another election. A 2% swing nationally would have won Romney the election. If the any of the elements of the Obama coalition don't show up in the future, than the necessary swing is even smaller.",B,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more nuanced and detailed explanation of why the GOP could still win another election, focusing on the concept of issue salience and how voters prioritize different issues when making their decision. By highlighting that social issues may not always be the most important factor for all voters, and that economic concerns, for example, can play a significant role in determining election outcomes, Reply B offers a more comprehensive argument that could potentially sway the original poster's perspective. 

In contrast, Reply A's argument relies more on the assumption that the original poster is in an echo chamber and doesn't consider other perspectives. While this may be a valid point to consider, it doesn't provide as strong of a case for why the GOP could still win another election, especially in the context of the original poster's concerns about social issues."
predict-explain,"It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified:

* The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for, either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild. If we're using the usual justification of animal rights - they can feel pain/have a life - then letting them lead a safe and happy life in captivity seems to be more moral than the dangers of the wild.

* This is a less quantifiable good, but zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies.

While I guess the best way to C my V would be to provide overwhelming evidence that zoos provide lower quality of life for the animals than life in the wild and that there are more effective means of conserving/promoting endanger species, I'm mostly interested in values/premises I haven't considered. 

Change my view! :)

1. Philosophically, I would disagree with putting primates in zoos since, as our closest relatives, they are very intelligent and behave a lot like us to the point that I consider them people. Bonobos are also already not allowed in zoos because they fuck all the time.

2. Piggybacking off my first point, there are also a lot of others that are intelligent enough to realize that life kinda sucks for them contained in a zoo all their lives. I can't imagine putting my cat or dog in one.

3. I would only agree with putting intelligent animals in zoos if it is primarily to preserve their species. A zoo is practically the only place where they would be given warmth and comfort.

Of course, the problem with all my points that that, where do we draw the line on intelligence? How do we know if an animal is dissatisfied with his/her life in the zoo? I'm not totally against zoos, but liveliness and health should come first for everyone in them.","Let me hit you with a dash of my philosophy, tell me what you think.

Are all animal lives of equal value? If the answer is yes, then all animals should be treated equally. Zoos offer preferential treatment to certain animals, therefore they are not offering equal treatment to all animals, and are unethical.

If your answer is no, then what determines an animal's life's worth? What criteria are used to decide which animals deserve to be kept in zoos and which are not? 

Generally, the more endangered a species is, the more likely it is to be found in a zoo. But species have been going extinct since long before humans were around, nature does this on its own. So zoos are in direct conflict with the natural order of life. So zoos = humans manipulating nature. We do this all the time, but generally for a practical purpose: e.g. living space, food, clothing, etc...

Considering that zoos are open to the public for general pleasure, and are only found in cities, they serve a purpose as entertainment. Is using an animal for entertainment ethical? 

Compare a zoo with a wildlife preserve, which is not designed for easy public access and provides a large space for endangered species to roam freely and reproduce naturally. A zoo then, is an artificial environment that only exists to provide us with entertainment. A wildlife preserve, with human assistance, would be more ethical than a zoo, as its purpose would be practical.

So a zoo is unethical, because it doesn't serve its purported purpose as well as other means. 

**tl;dr: Zoos discriminate against some animals, and use them solely for entertainment. If preservation is the real goal, there are more efficient ways to do so. As it stands, a zoo is just a place in the city where you can see animals not native to your region for fun.**",B,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B raises important questions about the ethical treatment of animals in zoos, highlighting the preferential treatment given to certain species and the ethical implications of using animals for entertainment. Additionally, it contrasts zoos with wildlife preserves, suggesting that there are more ethical and efficient ways to preserve endangered species. Overall, reply B presents a strong argument against the ethical justification of zoos and provides a compelling alternative perspective."
predict-explain,"The title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as slacks and a button down) but would be visible in casual wear (shorts and T-shirt). 

Such a tattoo would not affect chances of college acceptance for three reasons; the ubiquity of tattoos amongst college-aged individuals, the relative unimportance of personal image in the college acceptance process, and the low chance of anyone even seeing the tattoo.

According to a Pew Research Centre report, nearly 38% of college-aged individuals have a tattoo. While that is not a majority by quite a margin, it is a significant amount. Additionally, the popularity and accessibility of tattoos are steadily increasing year by year leading to a greater acceptance amongst a younger crowd. The point here is that because of their widespread nature, tattoos are no longer seen as a sign of rebellion simply because they are so commonplace. 

Furthermore, most colleges prefer to accept or deny students based on their applications alone, rather than on interviews. Unlike a job interview, in which personal image can make or break someone’s chances of getting employment, colleges tend to focus more on scholastic and athletic merit, test scores, and lifetime achievements first. Personal image is last on the docket for a school good enough to conduct personal interviews, if even considered at all. 

The previous two points also assume that a college will know about this tattoo, whereas that may not even be the case. In an interview process, there is no chance that the tattoo will be exposed in formal clothing. If the tattoo is exposed after acceptance, then there is no risk of a college retroactively denying admission based on that alone. 
This third point is also the keystone argument when it comes to employment. For the sake of this argument, I will assume that if an employer knows about any sort of tattoo, it will result in immediately being passed over for the job. This is not consistent with reality and the first two points I make concerning college can be applied to employment as well; tattoos are slowly gaining acceptance in the workforce as the 38% of college students with tattoos graduate and seek employment, and that employers will seek to hire the most qualified candidate with less emphasis placed on personal image. But even discarding these arguments, the possibility of an employer finding out about a tattoo covered by conservative formal clothing in professional situations is nil. 

(As some of you may have guessed, I have posted this because I am considering getting a tattoo and want to make an informed decision before doing so. I think I have carefully considered most ways that a tattoo could impact my life, but I wanted to hear some opposing arguments I may have overlooked and figured Reddit could help me out here)

For one, you sometimes get job offers at weird places. For instance I met a member of an accounting firm (I'm an accounting major) at a baseball game and got offered an interview. There was also a ""meet the firms"" night at a restaurant near campus that I accidentally stumbled upon and met many job prospects there.
Also, during my internship, we participated in some outdoor activities after work, like playing kickball with the employees, which helped you meet other people at your firm and helped make a good impression. 

My point is that you can't always rely on covering up a tattoo because sometimes you run into job opportunities or situations unexpectedly. Of course this only really applies if your tattoo is obscene or offensive, because most employers could care less if you have a tattoo as long as it isn't like, on your face or something.",Some firms don't like their employees having tattoos and they do discriminate. You say you don't think an employer will find out if you dress professionally. So clearly you think a tattoo puts you at a disadvantage. While for most good jobs employers will tend to go for the applicant with the best qualifications and experience. You should remember that usually there is no clear best candidate so a tattoo can make a difference. Its also worth remembering that many companies are involved in events such as charity fund raising or trade exhibitions where you may be required to wear a corporate t-shirt.,A,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides specific examples of situations where a tattoo could potentially impact employment opportunities, such as unexpected job offers in casual settings or team-building activities that require physical activity. This adds a practical element to the argument, showing that there are real-world scenarios where a tattoo could come into play.

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the potential discrimination some firms may have against tattoos and the idea that a tattoo could put someone at a disadvantage in the hiring process. While this is a valid point, it is more generalized and doesn't provide concrete examples or scenarios like reply A does.

Overall, reply A's specific examples make it more convincing and likely to make the original poster reconsider their views on getting a tattoo."
predict-explain,"I’m a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find silly/trivial. I’m currently dating a girl who is a VERY strong feminist. Over the weekend we were playing Mario Kart 64 and for as long as I can remember my go to character for Nintendo games has been Peach. There’s really no particular reason I do this other than I seem to do the best with Peach.

When I won the grand prix my girlfriend said “Ugh, I hate Peach, she’s such a weak and stereotypical female video game character.” To which I jokingly replied “Wow, that’s a SUPER sexist thing to say, and she’s obviously not that weak since I crushed you with her.” And her response to that was “Peach negatively reinforces the idea that women are weak and can only be saved by men in power like Mario.”

Then I made the mistake of saying “Well I don’t think that’s true.” We ended up getting into an argument over the portrayal of females in video games and how that perpetuates stereotypes in the real world. Her main argument was that most females in video games are portrayed as weak and need help from the male characters and this is detrimental to women in real life.

There were two issues I had with her argument, the first one being that there are a TON of badass female characters in video games who don’t need no man: Samus, Rosalina, Zelda/Sheik, Palutena, Bayonetta, Lara Croft, Ellie from the last of us, and GLaDOS (just to get a female villain in there). She shrugged this off by saying it’s still not enough because male protagonist characters outnumber female characters in video games. I feel like she wouldn’t be happy unless the numbers of male and female characters are exactly equal.

The second, and main issue I had with her argument is even if all female characters were represented as weak and helpless, I sincerely doubt there is any correlation between these characters and real world issues for women. For me video games are make believe, fiction, and stories. They’re imaginary worlds with imaginary characters. Saying the portrayal of women in video games perpetuates real societal problems for women (like pay inequality) is about as absurd to me as saying violence in video games perpetuates violence in real life, which from what I can tell [has been thoroughly debunked](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-33466-001/). Most reasonable people realize that women don’t wear bright pink dresses, pick vegetables with faces out of the ground, and get kidnapped from a giant turtle/dinosaur hybrid.

I provided my argument, and also said if Mario’s and Peach’s roles were reversed I could seriously not care less, as long as the game was still fun. Her response was “You won’t ever understand because you’re a guy.” I tried to continue on the debate but was met with the same response every time: “You won’t ever understand because you’re a guy.”

So here I am trying to change my view, while I may not agree with the feminist issue of women in video games, I feel like I’m more empathetic than what my girlfriend is giving me credit for. Have there been studies done about the portrayal of women in video games/stories and their effects on society? Is there any hard evidence for this correlation? 

EDIT: Yes, I get it, some people's feelings are hurt that Princess Peach is portrayed the way she is, and while making people upset IS a negative effect, this is not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for more of an impact than ""It's bad cause ma feelings are hurt""

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","I study media representations a little bit and might be able to address the points you raise.

You first point, that there are a ton of bad-ass female characters, may seem subjectively true but in the general demographic context of video games it is incorrect. There are certainly quite a few notable examples of bad-ass female characters but, in general, females are dramatically underrepresented in video games. A [content analysis of 150 video games from 2009](http://nms.sagepub.com/content/11/5/815.abstract) found that 85% of all video game characters were male. Of the 15% of characters that are female, the ""bad-ass"" characters are most definitely the exception. And even the ""bad-ass"" female characters are often still portrayed in highly gendered and sexualized ways. So even though you can call to mind several examples of non-helpless female characters, the fact remains that females are dramatically underrepresented and non-helpless female characters are only a portion of the already small number of female characters in video games. So, I don't think saying there are ""a ton of bad-ass female characters"" is an accurate reflection of actual video game demographics.

Your second point will probably be the more difficult one to change your mind about. You doubt that there is any connection between the way women are portrayed in video games and the way people think about and behave towards women in real life. Without getting too academic, I'll say that every person can be thought of as the result of a whole bunch of psychological and cultural ingredients. Some ingredients predispose a person to be a certain way and do certain things, while other ingredients do the opposite or cancel out effects. What this means is that it's never as simple as saying ""exposure to sexualized women will make someone a hostile sexist"" or ""exposure to violent video games will cause someone to be a violent criminal."" There are way too many other things going on to be able to make such a direct causal statement. However, repeated exposure to certain things most definitely changes the way you think about them, and these changes in the way you think about things then becomes one of the ingredients that makes you who you are and influences what you do. 

For an academic look at how we are all products and perpetuators of the society's we're part of the products we create and consume, read [this](http://web.stanford.edu/~hazelm/cgi-bin/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/2010-Markus-Kitayama_Culture-and-Self-A-cycle-of-mutual-constitution.pdf).

So with that said, let's talk about evidence that the media we consume can change the way we think about things. In another comment here, /u/fluffhoof mentions [this study](https://vhil.stanford.edu/pubs/2013/fox-chb-sexualized-virtual-selves.pdf) about the psychological effects of embodying a sexualized avatar. As a contrast to the single study you shared about violent video game effects, a [meta-analysis of studies examining the effects of violent video games](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20192553) found that playing violent video games was related to increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect, as well as decreased empathy and prosocial behavior. There are plenty of other examples where these come from and they all suggest that the kind of media we're exposed to can have real effects on the way we think about ourselves, and certain people and issues. Just because you don't become a hostile sexist or violent criminal after playing video games doesn't mean that they didn't have an effect on you.

Most of us probably have enough other ingredients in us that have to do with being egalitarian and reasonable and peaceful or whatever else, that the effects of exposure to this kind of media don't manifest themselves in obvious ways. But if you are repeatedly exposed to portrayals of women as helpless and sexualized, you will most likely think of women differently than if you hadn't been repeatedly exposed to those portrayals. And even if the only effect that exposure to these portrayals has on us is that we accept these portrayals as ""good"" or ""normal"" or ""typical of women"" or even just ""not unusual"" or ""not bad"" then it does a disservice to women in society by continuing to limit the way women are perceived and allowing the cycle of biased representations to continue.

Also, your girlfriend's point that ""you won't ever understand because you're a guy"" is absolutely true. You (if you're a male living almost anywhere in the world) have lived your life in a world where men are abundantly represented in real life and the media. Not only that but men are portrayed in a huge variety of ways: in positions of power, prestige, and notoriety as well as in positions of poverty, shame, and powerlessness, and so on. The point is that men have long enjoyed a very wide spectrum of representation, meaning that when someone thinks ""What is a man like?"" there is ample information to draw from and one can selectively draw from information that portrays men favorably. Women (and minorities) do not have that experience. Women are underrepresented in most media and they are represented in much narrower and limited ways than men are. So when one asks the question ""What is a woman like?"" the information one draws from is likely to be more scarce and more biased and this is likely to contribute to the perpetuation of people thinking that women are different than men in ways that they really aren't.

I get it if my arguments for subtle media effects having important consequences for society are hard to buy into. I get that a lot. One way or another, thanks for reading! :)","It is not easy (for me at the moment at least) to find studies that look at how representation in media influences how we think about and treat certain groups or how certain groups behave and think about themselves. 
For many people it is obvious that if for example a little black kid sees that the hero in the movies he watches is always a white guy, and people that look like him are only side-characters that might influence (not determine) the way he thinks about himself, the things he considers himself capable of and the things he goes on to pursue. And that media also influences what other people think he is capable of. Same could be said for representation of gender. This goes not only for movies but media in general. 

The expectation we have of certain groups (gender, race, orientation etc.) come largely from the society we life in and the things we perceive as normal or given. The alternative would be that we are born or naturally develop gender roles or stereotypes even without any interaction, to me that seems highly unlikely. I don't think that we are able to form our subconscious biases only by real world interaction without even being influenced by 'imaginary' content, like for example video games. 

However, you are right, that just because something seems obvious that doesn't mean that we don't need to go searching for scientific proof. 

Here is one study that I could find; 
&gt;To give one example of this effect, we know that (for reason not relevant here) women and minorities are underrepresented in media especially when it comes to characters that are professionally successful. There was a study done ""that finds evidence of a self-esteem boosting effect of television for white boys, but self-esteem damaging effects for white girls, black girls, and black boys.  One primary reason?  White boys see lots of white boys and men in the shows they watch.  And, not just that, but they regularly see these characters and actors in positive, powerful, and central roles."" ([quote](http://egrollman.com/2012/09/24/representation/), [source](http://crx.sagepub.com/content/39/3/338.abstract)). 

A quote from a [2000 paper](http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/538/art%253A10.1023%252FA%253A1007046204478.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1023%2FA%3A1007046204478&amp;token2=exp=1436542114~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F538%2Fart%25253A10.1023%25252FA%25253A1007046204478.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1023%252FA%253A1007046204478*~hmac=51f00906ba32d92292afd3dd80b6cca77d2c421d643bfd535be5c938b2c083ac) I could find that explains the process of how media might influence stereotypes:
&gt;Media analysts often use the concept of ‘‘frame’’ to explain how television imagery influences people (Entman, 1993; Gamson, Croteau, Hoynes, &amp; Sasson, 1992; Gitlin, 1980; Goffman, 1974). Although recent audience studies reveal that viewers do not automatically mimic what they see on television, the imagery they observe facilitates specific forms of understanding, interpretation, and experience (Press, 1991). Media images provide a diffuse confirmation of one’s world view, promote acceptance of current social arrangements, and reassure people that things are the way they ought to be. In social psychological terms, media images become incorporated into cognitive schema and heuristics, and are called up during processes of identity formation, self-evaluation, attribution, and social comparison. 

In the absence of more prove (that I could find) you could read up on the psychological process of stereotype development and schemata and decide for yourself if you think it is likely that these things are influenced by media. You could also talk to people with little children and ask them about how their kids react to representation in media or look online for people describing their experience. 

So far, you haven't been delivered absolute scientific prove. However, I'm also not aware of proof of the opposite viewpoint that representation does *not* influence us. Given that representation is indeed very poor for women and minorities (there's lots of scientific proof for *that*) and that many people are upset with this and wish it were better I at least see no reason to argue for the contrary.",A,A,"I would say reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because reply A provides more detailed information and evidence to support the argument that media representation can have real effects on the way we think about and treat certain groups. It also addresses the specific points raised by the original poster and offers a nuanced perspective on the issue. Additionally, reply A acknowledges the difficulty in changing someone's mind on this topic and presents the information in a respectful and informative manner. Overall, reply A presents a well-reasoned argument backed by evidence, making it more likely to sway the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"Marriage as a word comes from the Middle english word *mariage*, which according to sources from Wikipedia, comes from around 1200-1300 CE. Word comes from another Old French word then to a Latin word *marītāre*, which describes a husband and wife. Adding on top of that, many modern religions using the word to describe the ceremony as a marriage between one man and one woman, I see that the word Marriage is intrinsically religious. 

Now moving to modern day, Marriage is changing as many people are adding to/changing the meaning to a word that many people use as a religious word. People are getting up in arms about these and I can see their points. Marriage in a lot of religions these days is still defined as one man and one woman. Now have a court/government adding to/changing that definition of that word, this is where I believe the whole issue is. The issue with people not wanting gay marriage based off religious beliefs is because a word is being used for something that it does not mean to them. Marriage is/from religion and should keep it that way. We need to rename Marriage in the government to remove this part of the issue that the anti-gay marriage community has with it.  

Now I know it still won't remove the whole problem that the anti-gay community has with gay marriage but I believe it will remove everyone who dislikes that this word, that is so entrenched in religion, is being redefined by a government decision. I even see a huge problem with these, I am not religious and completely for two consenting people getting married, no matter who/what they are. The government needs to change its vocabulary so that when you want your union to be legal, you go get a Civil Union(Or whatever we call it) from the government. But if you want to get married, you must find a religion that accepts your union. This returns marriage to Religion and I believe removes a huge part of the problems we are having in the acceptance of this practice.  

[Source of Etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage#Etymology)

HUGE EDIT: So /u/awa64 and /u/cptal has brought to my attention some information. The intrinsic nature of the word marriage that I was bringing up has some flaws. The act of marriage seems to have been more of a social thing rather than a religious thing off the bat. The church seemed to basically be the best at keeping records and the sacrament didn't come until later. So even though the nature of the word has been pretty much a religious definition for a while, the word itself is not intrinsically religious. [Here](http://www.sexarchive.info/ATLAS_EN/html/history_of_marriage_in_western.html) and [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1awx09/does_marriage_really_have_its_roots_in_religion/c91ik9s) are their sources they brought to me. 

So with further communications with others, I have been bringing up that society is changing the word marriage and my view is more of a fix to speed up that change at least on the religious vs government front. The word will change in society but that takes a long time. As /u/GAB104 and a few others pointed out, that religion has change a bit from what it used to be. The whole owning your wife and stuff seems to come up a lot. So my view has changed a little but I still view that changing the government wording to something else would be a good thing to do as to remove the current problems that many religious people(That care about the issue) have with the definition of that word being changed. Here in this comment, I quickly chat about my experience with Mormons that have issues with gay marriage: https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3df9or/cmv_marriage_is_between_one_man_and_one_woman/ct4n55g

Adding on top of that, many modern religions using the word to describe the ceremony as a marriage between one man and one woman, I see that the word Marriage is intrinsically religious.

The word marriage is just a word. It isn't intrinsically *anything*. It means whatever we've collectively decided it means, and for quite some time now it's been used to describe a romantic union, especially from a legal standpoint.

I don't care what modern religious people use for their words. That doesn't mean anything to me, since I am not religious.

&gt; Now moving to modern day, Marriage is changing as many people are adding to/changing the meaning to a word that many people use as a religious word. People are getting up in arms about these and I can see their points. Marriage in a lot of religions these days is still defined as one man and one woman.

Marriage is/from religion and should keep it that way. We need to rename Marriage in the government to remove this part of the issue that the anti-gay marriage community has with it.

The government isn't changing the definition of anything. It's simply allowing gay people to operate under the umbrella of marriage like straight people already do.

If you're religious and you have your own definition for marriage, well bully for you! But that doesn't mean you get to own the word. It just means you have your own definition for it.

&gt; Now I know it still won't remove the whole problem that the anti-gay community has with gay marriage but I believe it will remove everyone who dislikes that this word, that is so entrenched in religion, is being redefined by a government decision.

But if you want to get married, you must find a religion that accepts your union. This returns marriage to Religion and I believe removes a huge part of the problems we are having in the acceptance of this practice.

This is wholly unnecessary. Religious people simply need to get over it, they don't own the word. If I want to buy two rats and give them a marriage ceremony and go around calling them married I am free to do so. They can't stop me.

But frankly, every time civil unions come up those same religious folks are against it. This ""debate"" isn't about the word marriage at all - that's just a way to make it look like your real problem isn't with gay people.","&gt; The issue with people not wanting gay marriage based off religious beliefs is because a word is being used for something that it does not mean to them.

&gt;&gt; Marriage is/from religion and should keep it that way.

[Many religious institutions do support same-sex marriages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_on_same-sex_marriage#Religious_support). I don't believe that religious views about this matter are as consistent as you think. Why should one Church's views supersede another's?

And the word is entrenched in legal language as well as society. It means ""more"" somehow than civil union. I don't know why, but that seems to be the case. Separate but equal isn't actually equal, is it /u/slai47?",B,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A effectively counters the original poster's argument that marriage is intrinsically religious by pointing out that the word itself is just a word and its meaning is determined by society. The reply also challenges the idea that the government is changing the definition of marriage, instead arguing that it is simply allowing gay people to have the same rights as straight people. This reply also addresses the suggestion to rename marriage to civil union, stating that it is unnecessary and that religious people need to accept that they do not own the word marriage. 

Overall, Reply A provides logical and strong counterarguments to the original poster's points, making it more likely to change their view."
predict-explain,"I support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a 'joke' as angry liberals make it seem.

What I'm trying to say, is that people should not be forced into believing and supporting gay marriage, gay/lesbian/transgender/pansexual and all that—they should be allowed to express their freedom of religion without the oppression of liberalism the way they expect not to be oppressed by conservatism. Seems very hypocritical, no?

The point here, is that staunch liberals have a very high tendency to be hypocritical towards religion, but get really offended when a conservative does the same towards them.

It all makes no sense to me, and I want to be open to changing my belief about this one way or the other. It's a big mess that aggravates me, because no one on the far sides of the spectrum sticks to their word very well. I'm a libertarian, so I have my likes and dislikes toward each side, and I would like to understand these specific viewpoints better.

EDIT: This blew up a lot more than I thought it would, which is good. I got a lot of clarification, and I've awarded some &amp;#8710;'s. To be more specific (if you're trying to step in my shoes), I USED to be a devout Catholic, until I thought some of the teachings were immoral and 'behind the times.' I just don't think that religion is a bunch of crap as some make it out to seem; however, since my view has been changed, I believe that as people should have freedom of religion, that freedom of religion can only go so far before it becomes a legal issue. I believe that freedom of religion already has a more bigoted starting point than the opposite viewpoint which is more 'realistic' shall I say.","People already have freedom of religion. You can go to any church you want. 

It seems that you want there to be some type of freedom of bigotry where you can say bigoted things and then there are no consequences. If you're a shop owner and you use your religion to say that all gays are going to hell or any of the other drivel than I have the right now to go to your business. 

But also I have to add, even if you feel that gay marriage is horrible why should they restrict it for another group of people?","I'm confused. Of course people should have freedom of religion. I think the vast majority of liberals will resoundingly agree with that.

Nobody is being forced to like gay marriage. Nobody is being forced to perform gay marriages. Everyone is free to express their religion. Everyone is also free to criticize someone else's religion. Everyone is also free to criticize other people for criticizing someone else's religion. What's the issue here?

If this is all about one of those ""I don't want to bake a gay wedding cake"" stories, lets cut to the chase and talk about that particular case. But that's the closest thing I can see to what you're saying.",A,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B addresses the original poster's concerns directly and provides a clear and concise explanation of the current situation regarding freedom of religion and the LGBTQ+ community. It also points out that criticism and disagreement are a part of freedom of speech and expression, which is an important aspect to consider in this discussion. Reply A, on the other hand, focuses more on consequences for actions rather than addressing the original poster's beliefs and concerns."
predict-explain,"I'm a programmer, and I am really interested in data science and machine learning. I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites and collect leads for the marketers (which is probably me favorite part of the job). It feels really fulfilling to me to make something (a bot) that does what a person couldn't do in a month's full time work. That, and it feels rewarding knowing I gathered something(s) with immediate marketable value. That, and that, and the idea of all of the potential uses and benefits to having this information. 

I've been to a lot of hackathons (programming-marathons) and open-data is an awesome opportunity to make something cool and resume-building quickly (hackathons are usually only 24-48 hours overnight). The more data out there, the more possibilities there are to help the public or invent something novel.  

I think of the government the same way, if the data they collect and use helps their ability to govern then I am all for it.  

And on a personal level, I don't care that whoever is tracking my phone, reading my emails, whatever. I'm just glad someone is using my information to make my life and the lives of others to be better.  

Edit: you guys got me  
-If the NSA collected less information, it could be more useful and usable.    
-Your Emails, much like music or physical letters, *should* be your own private property, even if they aren't now  
-I can't both agree that the NSA should collect this information and the NSA should do this legally, because they are collecting it illegally it is a logical fallacy  
-By agree to this, I take away other people's privacy rights, and that's not okay  
-There could be new data or ways of analyzing it that would more seriously violate privacy or give power, and this is setting a bad precedent  
-Mass surveillance is bad historically

But blanket collection of all communications data isn't the same, since you have to actually comb through important legal checks before you can use it, and make sure nothing is a false positive.

predict-explain,"Country music was not always bad. There were legends such as Johnny Cash who defined what country music was. 

However, today the country music culture is full of songs about booze, trucks, tractors, and women. Almost every song sounds exactly the same, following the same chord structure, tone, and melodies. There is no creativity when it comes to country music and it has not had a positive influence on the music industry. Although there may be a few exceptions to this, the majority of modern country is awful, redundant, and lacks any sort of meaning.

I'm not a fan of (popular, modern) country either, largely for the same reasons you cited.  I'm not much of a fan of pop music, either, and the country you'll find on today's radio is basically just pop with anything edgy or sophisticated taken out.  Basically just pop without what pop is good at.

On the other hand, there's no doubt an art to making music for mass consumption.  It may not be the type of art that you particularly enjoy.  It may not be the type of art that I particularly enjoy.  But it's an art that takes a tremendous amount of skill, expertise, and talent nonetheless.

In other words, country may seem formulaic, but if you thought it could be easily replicated you'd be out making millions and banging groupies right now.

When I hear a popular radio song that doesn't fit my taste, I've learned to appreciate it by listening for what it does that has made it rise about the countless number of other songs people hoped desperately to be as popular.  For example: the song I'm listening to may have dumb lyrics, but they're lyrics that still appealed to people in some profound way that other, similar songs did not.  Or the song may have a cheesy hook, but what is it about that hook that made it so popular?  That sorta thing.","It seems that you are mostly only familiar with pop country, which is the country commonly put on the radio.  It has the same problems of general pop music in that it is very repetitive and formulaic as the goal is not to make good music, but to sell music.  However, if you ignore the radio, it is fairly easy to find good country music.For me, I enjoy the subgenres of folk and bluegrass.  

[Here is a good example of bluegrass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6kihlmvAfQ).  Notice that it doesn't even need lyrics and relies entirely on the sound of the instruments.  [Bluegrass also can use vocals, such as this one about a river where the signer grew up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCDHxPzrHgo)  Sometimes, a band might also [cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMrAbPSUhA4) existing songs from [other genres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c7bISLhVl8).

Folk you don't often see much originality in terms of lyrics, as it is often involves taking an existing song and putting your own spin on it (compare these [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28Bq_2soGIA) very different takes on the [same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaS3vaNUYgs) song).  [Here is an example that omits the lyrics, but is still highly recognizible to anyone familiar with it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFyvxxsm7RQ)  In terms of relation to other genres of music, American folk music is very closely tied to [Scottish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k9YWf9gWaA) and [Irish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE9l2p0kLKk) folk music, to such an extent that they will [often blur together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuwzsFAFllA).

predict-explain,"Greetings!

I've long held this belief and constantly fought with more patriotic members of my country (Hungary) over it, as they say it will lead to cultural decay.

However, as far as my understanding of History goes, Humanity kept uniting into bigger and bigger groups.

I'm not sure whether my order is correct, but it's merely to give an example of what I am seeing.

First, families started working together as it was easier to hunt that way  
Then, they started to form small tribal communities  
Then, these tribal communities united into alliances and ""great tribes""  
Then, the tribes became petty kingdoms  
Then, the petty kingdoms were either swallowed by a larger one, or swallowed the smaller ones.  
Then, the kingdoms they formed kept absorbing the smaller communities that were similar in culture

And then there are countries like the United States and Russia, both spanning almost entire continents or more. Likewise, they have the strongest presence as well. The United Kingdom had an equally great presence during its Imperial days, which it more or less managed to retain.

I feel Europe could easily raise its economy to the third power if each current country paid its tax to a single, central government that viewed each part of the union equally, at most... with different strategies, investiture focuses.

The main counter arguement I see against an united Europe is cultural decay or incompatibility, but I do not understand how it would get in the way too much. Culture won't disappear just because people answer to a single elected government, neither will it disappear due to people wandering within the borders.

The user also mentions that EU membership already offers many benefits similar to those that a political union would provide. This response effectively addresses the original poster's points and provides logical reasoning for why a political union may not be necessary or beneficial for European countries. 

Reply B, on the other hand, focuses on the diversity of languages and cultures within Europe, which could potentially make a political union more challenging. While this is a valid point, it does not directly address the economic or practical implications of a united Europe, which were the main points raised by the original poster. Additionally, the user's argument that having an EU passport already allows for easy travel within European countries undermines the need for a political union.

predict-explain,"The US Constitution was written at a time when states believed they needed a check on federal power. Requiring a body that represented all states equally to pass any legislation seemed to preserve those rights.

However, this attitude is mostly archaic today. Representing every state equally allows small states disproportionate power in matters pertaining to the whole country. Why should they be able to block the rest of the country's people from deciding on federal matters? It's essentially saying that voters in North Dakota, Vermont and Alaska are more important than elsewhere.

If you can find me a purpose for the US Senate as an actual decision-making body in today's day and age, and not just as a vastly unrepresentative body that has the power to completely kill legislation that most Americans support, please CMV.

It is unreasonable in a republic to expect an elected body to be a rubber stamp.  In as much as they are elected by the people they represent, Senators have a duty to exercise their powers to meaningfully represent them.

2. This is a republic, not a democracy.  The objective is to have governance accountable to the people, not to have the people's will on every issue immediately enacted.  The Senate has been a valuable part of good governance in the United States, and there is great benefit in not rushing to pass legislation on the barest of legislative majorities.

3.  The Senate is not able to be gerrymandered because of the fixed borders among states.  This is a major problem for how representative House seats are.  For instance [in 2012, Democrats got 1.5 million more votes for the House than Republicans, but more Republicans were elected by a large margin.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2012)

4.  There is value in having a small legislative body whose membership does not change quickly.  There are a lot of members of the house, which means few of them have much negotiating leverage over bills, and cannot exert influence over leadership.  Further, because they're elected every 2 years, they constantly need party support for their next election.  Senators have more time in office, and are in a small enough body where their one vote can make a meaningful enough difference to get changes.","To the extent that your concern is that the Senate is *actually* a forum for small states to block the rest of the country's people from deciding on federal matters, I would argue that the Senate is at least better than the House in this respect.  Because of demographic sorting, gerrymandering, and disproportionate representation of small states, the House gives hugely unequal weight to the opinions of rural and suburban voters, and undervalues urban voters.  Hence how in 2012 House Democrats could actually receive 1,000,000 more popular votes than the Republicans yet walk away with only 46% of the seats.",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides several reasons for the importance of the Senate as a decision-making body in today's day and age, including the duty of Senators to represent their constituents, the value of having a small legislative body with more stable membership, and the benefits of not rushing to pass legislation on slim majorities.

predict-explain,"Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said:

What happens after the honeymoon period when one person still desires sex, but their partner has lost interest (commonly referred to as a [dead bedroom](http://reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms))?

I think it's still the duty of the disinterested party to at least minimally fulfill the sexual needs of their partner, if sustaining the relationship is a priority. In bullet form, here's why:

* Each partner in the relationship is the others' only source of intimacy and sex (assuming a monogamous relationship), therefore if one partner withholds sex, the physical needs of the other is not being met. What is ultimately a chore or an inconvenience for one partner is a physiological necessity for the other.

* Compromise is fundamentally part of every aspect of a relationship, and sex is no different. I'm conflicted in my thinking on this point: No one should be made to have sex if they don't want to. However, both my SO and I do things for each other that we don't necessarily want to do because it's better for the relationship, or it makes the other happy. I don't believe sex and intimacy should be treated differently- it's reasonable to have expectations of sex as a requirement of the relationship.

Thoughts?","You make some really good points, OP. One thing to consider is that sex is not a physiological need, people go without it all the time. The benefits of orgasm can be achieved through masturbation, and the benefits of intimacy can be achieved through cuddling and other intimacy beside sex. If the partner also objects to cuddling and so on, then the high libido person can get this from people outside the relationship, just as a single person would.","I agree with your general concept, but don't understand why it wouldn't work both ways. If a person desires to not have sex but then does so anyway, then their sexual needs aren't being met in the relationship. 

Why is it that you feel that the person with the lower libido is the only one who should have to compromise, when by doing so they are being left unfulfilled?",B,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides a different perspective on the issue by pointing out that sex is not a physiological need and that intimacy can be achieved through other means besides sex. By suggesting alternatives such as masturbation and cuddling, Reply A challenges the original poster's belief that the disinterested party has a duty to fulfill the sexual needs of their partner. Reply A also brings up the option of seeking fulfillment outside the relationship, which may prompt the original poster to reconsider their stance on the issue."

I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing him/her, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen. Plus, even if the suspect is really guilty, a police officer shouldn't kill him/ her, right? And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?

I believe that in a situation where, having attempted to use more reasoned methods of discipline or persuasion, a child is still behaving badly/doing something they shouldn't then there is nothing wrong with smacking them, as long as it's not in a way that causes genuine unreasonable pain.

The only way to guarantee a kid won't do something again is if they become aware of the feelings of others and *why* what they did was bad.,"There's evidence that shows that spanking, and corporal punishment in general, is related to slower cognitive development of children. [This study](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=250684) shows that those children who were not spanked gained over 5 more points (on a 100-point scale) compared with those children who were spanked.

That's not all, of course. It's known that children who are spanked and harshly disciplined are more likely to show signs of anxiety and depressive symptoms.

predict-explain,"I would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT community. I have several gay friends and I am very informed about LGBT issues including transgenderism. I believe that conflicts of gender/identity/orientation etc. are innate and not a choice. 

I hold this belief because I feel as though this world will never be fully accepting of the LGBT community. It saddens me to see the statistics of [depression and suicide](http://www.healthline.com/health/depression/gay#1) amongst youth in this group of people. LGBT kids are nearly 4x more likely to be depressed and suicidal than straight peers. The majority are bullied in school as well. Many of these people don't want to come out and have to live with this secret. Many of these people do come out and they are rejected. I understand that the world is a beautiful place because there are so many types of people. I also believe that we should make every effort to accept, love, and tolerate each other. However, we are only making these strides because people have always been and will always be born gay/bi/transgender etc. If this was not possible then this issue would never occur. Also, I am aware that many people in the LGBT community are proud to be gay. However, I can't help but feel as though they are embracing it because they have no other choice. I feel as though most (if not all) of these people must have had at least one dark moment where they felt different and wanted to be like everyone else.

I would like to add that I am not supporting eugenics. I do not want to prohibit people who would be born with the gay gene from being born at all. I just want to remove the possibility of the person acquiring that gene. Furthermore, I do not wish to modify every single gene to make the perfect human beings. I am only speaking about this issue. Also, I would only encourage this if it could be done safely and would have no major side effects.

Edit: My view has been changed and I am done replying. 80% of the counter-arguments were just bashing eugenics and that hardly changed my view at all. Look at the comment by /u/Miguelinileugim for a well-thought, original point.

Gays don't reproduce naturally. Now if you are suggesting that gays shouldn't have the option to donate eggs/sperm in order to reproduce then you are perpetuating the culture you yourself are being demeaning off. 

Now let's just say you managed to change the culture associated with the hatred of the lgbt community entirely, and people really couldn't give a rats ass about who you love. In that case socio economics still limits the amount of gays that can afford to reproduce through the artificial insemination procedure. Eventually numbers would lower so much extinction would occur. 

All in all, I don't believe there is a view to change here other than your approach. Since what your asking is taking place by natural selection, all I can say is your reasoning for wanting this to happen is encouraging of the existing culture to dislike the community. Your reasoning seems to accept the bad values that people hold and proposes a solution to live with those bad values. By that reasoning, if we can locate a gene that produces bigots and eliminate that, we could solve all race and discriminatory issues! Unfortunately that would leave us with hardly any humans left.  

My conclusion is that nature in this sense shouldn't be messed with. If it needs taking care of, it will take care of itself. Even cultural systems that perpetuate a bad practice for no apparent value eventually come to an end when they come face to face with a larger opposing view (I.e. Cortes and the Aztecs, or Chritians and the Moors (aka Islamics)). 

Whether you believe in eugenics or not, your reason advocates for it, and if you truly are sincere in not advocating it but still believe in eliminating a certain community, then at that point you really are just discriminatory towards that group and therefore not an ally as you so claim.

There is inconsistency with this post, and I hope that I've at least changed your concern towards the matter to a more cultural one that genetic one.","THIS COMMENT

isn't like the rest of this thread. Most of these can be summed up as ""Eugenics are wrong Hitler are wrong you are Hitler DIEEEEE"". This is not that kind of comment, knowing that please read further.

Eugenics are wrong? Whoever thinks that is extremely close-minded, the only valid argument against eugenics is the risk that it would pose for a group to decide the future of all humans, everything is else is just religious crap or Godwin's law. Eugenics is great, our genes worked great once but now they're incredibly outdated, it's like trying to run Skyrim on windows 95, it's not gonna work well. Eugenics could eliminate anything from genetical diseases and push our lifespan beyond the 120 telomere barrier to eliminating pointless hormonally-triggered violence and improving the intelligence of the population.

Now your problem is the following (other than most likely there isn't a ""gay gene"" but rather some weird interaction of genes that have that effect), homosexuality is inferior to heterosexuality because it limits which people you find attractive to from 45% of the population (ie the 90% of the opposite gender that is straight/bi) to just 5% (ie the 10% of the same gender that is homosexual/bi). Everything else such as weird anatomical stuff and not being able to have children in a conventional way isn't that bad as homosexual sex is about as pleasurable as heterosexual one and artificial insemination and surrogate mothers can solve the problem of having children almost entirely.

Consequently, homosexuality is bad because it limits the number of available partners, but do you know what is almost as bad? *Heterosexuality*. Fuck that crap, bisexuals have it all, they can sleep with men and women alike, they can both enjoy the 90% from the opposite sex and then 10% from their same gender, they can enjoy both genders and experience the sensations that both genders experience, they're just *objectively* superior.

It doesn't matter how much hentai you watch or how many people of the same sex you try to sleep with, the fact is that to some extent sexual orientation is genetical and you can't change it. Having a bisexual genetical profile is a genetical advantage (not necessarily an evolutive one that's why it isn't more common) as it allows people to feel attracted to more people without any downside.

And thus, if we find a gay gene we should eliminate it, and if we find a straight gene we should obliterate it too, and instead put a bisexual gene in its place.

GOD I WISH BEING BISEXUAL WAS A CHOICE BUT I CAN'T, so I'll have to stick with the opposite sex I suppose, darn my luck, but it could be worse.",B,A,"I would say that reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view.

Reply A addresses the ethical concerns surrounding eugenics and discrimination, which may prompt the original poster to reconsider their stance. 

On the other hand, reply B takes a more extreme and controversial stance on eugenics and sexual orientation. While it does provide some arguments against the original poster's view, it does so in a more confrontational and provocative manner. This approach may not be as effective in changing the original poster's view as it focuses more on advocating for a different sexual orientation rather than addressing the ethical and cultural implications of genetic manipulation. 

Overall, reply A presents a more reasoned and nuanced argument that is likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially lead to a change in their view."

For you, fireworks may not offer much excitement so the risks of physical harm may not be worth the monetary cost or potential danger. However, you must recognize that there are many things which you may find boring but another person may find very entertaining.

For another person, fireworks may be the shit. They may spend all day and all night fantasizing about them. They may spontaneously orgasm every 4th of July for 5 hours gazing up at the sky. I personally don't understand how people enjoy birdwatching, either, but there's plenty of people who do. You can't possibly quantify what other people like.

For the people that enjoy fireworks and fireworks shows, the relatively small risk (if you handle them properly) compared to the enjoyment they get from the experience is worth it for them. They are paying for a night which they hold fond in their memories, a sense of wonder, a feeling of pleasure. You may not understand it and may even consider it a waste of time and resources, but that's OK. No one is holding a firecracker to your head and making you enjoy it.

Also, as a personal anecdote, this isn't terribly uncommon. It seems people either love fireworks or hate them. I personally love them, but only when I'm the one lighting them. For that reason, my family has always taken turns shooting ""our"" fireworks.","I see where you're coming from bud, but I was actually discussing something with a friend last night that I had never considered.

Rockets and cannons firing all around you but you just kind of sit there and hope that the carnage doesn't find you. ""Bombs bursting in air"" and all that.

Reply A provides a well-reasoned argument that acknowledges the subjective nature of enjoyment and entertainment. It emphasizes that what may be boring or unenjoyable for one person may be incredibly exciting and pleasurable for another. By highlighting the personal enjoyment and memories that people get from fireworks displays, Reply A effectively argues that the monetary cost and potential danger are worth it for those who find joy in fireworks.

On the other hand, Reply B introduces a historical perspective on fireworks and their connection to independence, which may not be as relevant to the original poster's argument about the lack of art and pace in private fireworks displays. While the historical context is interesting, it may not directly address the original poster's concerns about the lack of entertainment and excitement in fireworks displays.

Overall, Reply A provides a more compelling argument by focusing on the individual enjoyment and value that fireworks bring to those who appreciate them, which could potentially change the original poster's view on the subject."
predict-explain,"We sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been ""thin shamed"" or ""skinny shamed"" by another woman.  I don't see how that is possible in American society, being a thin woman is a desirable quality.

This alleged shaming is typically expressed with language such as ""you need to eat something"" or ""do you even eat"" or ""you're so skinny"" or ""you need some meat on your bones"" or ""you need a hamburger"".  In all of those cases, the speaker is not criticizing the subject of the speech for being thin.

predict-explain,"First thing, let's assume the biblical Jesus is completely true. 

Now, I have a fair knowledge of the biblical tale, but if I say something wrong, feel welcome to correct me. I'll use the most ""accepted"" version of the story: 

*Jesus was one with God, part of the Holy Trinity and one day he decided humanity should be saved with the ultimate sacrifice: his own life. In order to do that he came to Earth and lived like a normal human, teaching his ways to others. 30 and something years after his human birth he met his fate. Tortured and humiliated he sacrificed his life to give humanity a chance of redemption, he was the Lamb of God. After that he was resurrected and went back to heaven to live like god for the rest of eternity* 


Alright, this is a big deal because a divine creature came to Earth to sacrifice himself for humans, an unthinkable act. Problem is, Jesus choices were:

1. Save humanity and suffer a lot of pain for a couple months (if you consider the very act of becoming human a bad thing, then let's say 30ish years) and go back to Heaven
2. Not save humanity and stay as god forever

Provided you're not completely cold and oblivious being, 1) is clearly the only logical choice here, you are trading an infinitely small piece of your life for saving an entire race that you created, why not? Compared to eternity the suffering is meaningless. It's like if for giving 1 cent to a person Bill Gates could save that persons life. Of course he would. Anyone would. You don't need to be pure goodness to do that, not even close.

So, what is the merit of Jesus sacrifice?","Let’s start with your framing position!

To begin with, Jesus’ pre-incarnate status as divine is (based on the biblical text) poorly understood at best (although John certainly though he pre-existed). Positions have been argued most vehemently both ways, but his pre-incarnate state is, to us, basically opaque. I’ll not take a position here, except to say that the way you framed this question would have to be considered pretty speculative. Let’s work with what’s recorded, instead!

To talk about Jesus’ sacrifice and why it might be important, you’d have to talk about who he is, and what he represents. You’ve alluded to this in your question, but what do we mean when we say Jesus is the Lamb of God, and why does that matter?

Jesus is the Messiah; that is, he is God’s anointed (in the same way as Saul, David, and Solomon) to be God’s king and representative to the Jews. There had been many, many other anointed in the past; every king of Israel was messiah. Jesus was claiming that office. The miracles of Jesus’ ministry are in part signifiers of his credentials. That is, he’s demonstrating that he actually is sent on God’s authority.

The difference here is that Jesus is pushing for an expanded understanding of God, His law, and His kingdom. Jesus in the gospels is claiming to be the king who is prophesied to usher in God’s kingdom and begin the rule of God on earth. His claims and stance, coupled with the miraculous signs like healing, caused a high degree of polarization in the contemporary Jewish community.

That said, let’s take another look at your framing question, as it seems to be the foundation of your perspective. As you’ve set it up, it kind of sounds like Jesus is saying “Heigh ho, better pop off to Earth for a spot of the old redemption, what? Oops, pesky humans, with their crucifying! Well, back to eternity; at least the blighters have a chance now.”

Instead, let’s take the text at face value and look at it as Jesus is recorded to have done. This is a man who should have been treated like what he was, a prophet of God, a king and Messiah, and the representative of God to man. If those things are true (and we’re assuming they are for this argument), then respect and devotion are certainly appropriate responses. Jesus’ entire ministry is him pushing people to a clearer understanding and a refined relationship with the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This would all have been well within the understanding and history of the contemporary Jewish culture Jesus was in. There’s even precedent in the prophets for what Jesus was doing.

Now, it seems clear that Jesus himself knew that he would be killed. He alludes to it throughout the gospels (I shall raise this temple in 3 days, etc.). When we get the garden of Gethsemane, however, Jesus is incredibly stressed. He clearly does not want to be crucified, to the point where he is sweating blood. This is where we can answer your question with more accuracy. Jesus is not doing this because he wants to or because it’s easy. In fact, in the text, he’s not even doing it to save humanity. In Matthew 26:39, he asks not to be killed, and says that he does this because  it’s the Father’s will.

So, whatever Jesus’ pre-incarnate state, whatever else he might have done, however the kingdom might have manifested with his continued survival, in Christ’s crucifixion we can understand the term Lamb of God. This is a reference to the lamb of the Passover, the sacrifice whose blood on the lintel will signify your obedience to the Lord, and thereby spare you from death. It’s a reference to the Exodus, and God’s salvation of the Israelites from bondage. In the same way, Jesus’ sacrifice frees us from the bondage and slavery of sin.

The merit in the sacrifice is that Jesus, so far the only human being who lived as God intended (that is, without sin and prioritizing God’s will),  is brutally executed *while doing God’s will*. His life and the manner of his death signify and confirm his authority from God, and that empowers him to be our representative, at once satisfying to God as doing as an actual human ought, and understandable to us because he’s from our context.
Just to reiterate, in the Scripture Jesus is acting like a human. There are things he doesn’t know. The power he uses is from God. He’s scared at the prospect of his execution. These are not the traits of an aloof divine being going through the motions. For Jesus, it’s not a sacrifice of no value, but a protracted and painful (and humiliating) death.
The next logical question is to ask why a sacrifice is necessary at all, and that’s a tougher one to answer. From the old to new testaments, sacrifice and death are always used to redeem sin. My understanding is that it’s an illustration of the seriousness of sin and its consequences, but I’d understand if that answer failed to satisfy.
Anyway, hope that helps. I really rushed through this; there have been books and books written on this subject. If anything was unclear or you’d like more info, I’m happy to expand on any details.

TL;DR: Jesus wasn’t a detached divine being, according to the text. His sacrifice was at great personal cost. He was God’s representative and rightful king of Israel (indeed, all the world), and therefore should have been treated as such rather than being wrongfully executed. His perspective was not one of giving away 30+ years out of a million billion, but rather one of being God’s faithful servant within a limited human lifetime. The merit in his sacrifice is that he did God’s will in his life to the point of unfair death at the hands of those he came to help, and that makes his sacrifice sufficient to repair our relationship with God, from God’s perspective.","I'm very much a wild man in my faith, I wander the whole world's ideas and beliefs in search of truth. I was raised as a (Presyterian) Christian but had to reject all of it at a certain point in life. My return to Christianity has been very much a surprise, and made possible by setting aside everything that other humans have told me about God and Truth... including the Bible. I do still read the Bible, and seek out the perspectives of others. I also read many, many other things.

Christ's death is the least relevant part of my experience of the divine. It's a little irreverent to say that, but it is just where I am at. I have heard the explanations and sermons, *ad nauseum*, about why Christ's death was a big deal. There's a lot of history involved, for one, about the prophecies and emotional-spiritual undercurrents of the Israelite/Jewish peoples and their journey and evolution. It takes quite a bit of research to really grasp in its true extent, given how insanely long ago all of this happened. (The cultures and peoples in question, and the world in general, looked radically different. Plus there's a language barrier to overcome.)

Also there are theological perspectives, built and expounded upon since Christ's death, which some people are really into. Christ being a bridge between humanity and God, Christ's death absolving all sins, all sorts of things that I have listened to at some length over the course of my life. And these things are ok I guess. I like some more than others, connect with some more than others.

But compared to the living truth I have met, the living spirit of consciousness and Life, the weird and wild and true Grace that has flown into me, and taught me what friendship even means, and shown me love and intimacy beyond what I could have hoped for, introduced me to intimacy in the first place ....ahhh it's truly incredible. Indescribable! Compared to this experience and love, the knowledge about this very ancient event, the death and resurrection of the man named Jesus, is well, just knowledge. It's an incredible story, and good to learn, but it's a little weird I think to focus on it so much. 

I'm sure my perspective will change subtly over time, but Christians focus so much on death and sin... they do so in order to show how God saves us from them. But if that's the case, why not frame it according to that premise? Talk about life and grace! That's more like how the spirit is with me.

Just, pure grace. Pure soul. Pure music.

So while I have, in a way, not directly addressed your claim, I wanted to share my experience. There is a living spirit, call it the living spirit of Truth, or call it God, or call it the elegant cosmos, but realize those are just sounds we make, little squiggles we write down that try to correspond to a much huger reality than can possibly be contained in mere squiggles, in mere perturbations of the air. This living spirit is a Great Friend, is a deep well of Truth, Light, and Love. Instead of trying to use 2000 year old information (which wasn't recorded very well at the time, which was notoriously and shamelessly edited by political bodies, which was copied over and over by scribes who introduce small but Telephone-like errors, and then translated once or twice across languages) to evaluate the nobility and admirable-ness of Christ or the spirit which filled the man, probe the here and now. Ask the living truth to show you its nobility. Ask Christ to show you here and now whether he is admirable. And, crucially, wait for an answer.

(Though this can be done alone, you might need to find a counselor, priest, artist, weirdo, musician, sheik, guru, yogi, or shaman to guide you through the morass of thoughts and feelings that keep our eyes shrouded.)

I highly recommend reading (or re-reading) The Chronicles of Narnia. Aslan is to me a better portrayal of Christ than that given by most of the New Testament.

predict-explain,"**tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting?**

I would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to sports, I know more and watch more than any of my peers through work, school, or friendship. I like hockey, baseball, and the NFL. But regular season games are boring.

Boring can be good sometimes. A casual baseball game on a lazy afternoon is amazing, and it's great in the background during a family gathering. Seeing a game in person is awesome and regular season games are perfect for that because if you miss a play it's not the end of the world. I find the NFL regular season *almost* engaging because of the short schedule. I understand that in the NHL and MLB you need to play more games so the gap between 1st and last is sufficiently large, so I'm not suggesting shorter schedules. I would just really like someone to make regular season games more exciting for me.

The NHL is my favorite by far, but I can't stand regular season games. Until the very end of the season it just feels like watching practice. There's no excitement. It's like a 10 cent bet. Until the end of the season, very little is on the line. I don't see the appeal.

So can someone explain it to me? When I ask my friends who do watch the regular season they get condescending.","The NFL schedule is good because it's so short.  With only 16 games on predictable days, each game has an urgency to it.  It's not quite playoff level, sure, but the difference of 1-2 games can mean an invitation to the playoffs or not... so the teams do bring their best every single game.  There's a lot of parity in the league, so you don't see too many atrocious teams or bad games. 

The MLB schedule is good because it's so long.  The times are predictable and games are cheap &amp; accessible (outside Boston &amp; NY, anyways).  They're not *exciting*, particularly on TV IMO... but they're fun in person, and nice to have on in the background on a lazy summer day.  There are some crummy teams/games, but MLB is a little more about the experience (drinking outside in a fun atmosphere) than the game itself IMO.

There's no problem with either of those - they're great fun.

I'd have to agree that the NBA &amp; NHL regular seasons kind of suck.  The sport is physical enough and the seasons long enough that there's injury / fatigue risk, so teams play kind of conservatively and rest star players aggressively.  But with 40 home games (instead of the 80-something of mlb), tickets are still rather pricey for many teams.  The game days/times aren't predictable, so I find myself missing them.  A crumby NBA team gets *killed* on the court, it's not supremely fun to watch.

I find myself watching the NBA Christmas day games, going in person a couple times and following my local team (often day after write ups), and then watching better matchups &amp; post season.  I'd love to see the NBA season cut down to 50-60 games and played on consistent days of week.  Can Tuesday, Friday, and Sunday be basketball days please?","You should watch soccer. The games are divided into multiple competitions for different trophies rather than a regular and post season. Its much better as every game in a 38 game Premier League season counts, from beginning to end. This also results in the overall best team winning the league rather than a team only playing well for a certain time of year prevailing. 

And if your into the do-or-die style like in playoffs, there are several cup tournaments thst incorporate the same feelings as playoffs.",A,A,"I would say reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"I'm seeing a lot of heat against FIFA because of the unequal pay distributed to US woman soccer players compared to men. (See this article for more info: http://www.cnbc.com/id/102811922) 

Now, while I agree that pay gaps are a problem in ~~general~~ some fields, sports is a different ballgame (no pun intended). As such, the success of a franchise is dependent on the supporters who pay money for tickets, gear, etc. If we were to look at attendance figures for the National Woman's Soccer League (NWSL) for 2014 compared to Major League Soccer (MLS), we see a huge disparity in people attending games. 

Of course, this translates over to other leagues. The NBA draws more people than the WNBA, both live and TV ratings. The revenue of the NFL is exponentially greater than the Independent Woman's Football League. 

I'm not here to provide solutions to this, or look into why the mentality of America draws more into guy sports. Yes, I think that ladies should be paid equally. ~~I also think ladies have the ability to play all sports as good as men do, if not better.~~ And of course, ladies have as much of a right to play in any sport and play it professionally. But (and yes here comes a South Park reference) ""...you can't expect people to watch."" My conclusion: the pay gap in sports is a consequence of economic revenue, rather than social injustice. 

Open to any replies and criticism.

EDIT: This is awesome and I thank you all for your input. You all taught me that there is a physical difference in athleticism between men and women. And that the pay gap is exaggerated.","""I also think ladies have the ability to play all sports as good as men do, if not better""

Hate to break it to you, but they aren't even comparable.

The womens national teams from some of the top countries in soccer will almost always get beat by mens U-17 U-18 or U-19.

The US national womens team scrimmaged the U-17 boys in 2012 and were beat 8-2.

Other top countries had similar results, and this is just what I know from soccer.","Your arguments are perfectly valid. Of course NBA players are going to be paid more than WNBA players as long as there are more people watching the NBA.

But take a step back and ask yourself, why do more people watch the NBA than the WNBA?

The chief claim is that men are better than women at sports, and we want to watch the best teams. While it's true that men's teams outperform women's teams, it's ridiculous to say that we only want to watch the best teams. Some fans choose college games over professional because they're more exciting. Fans of the Mets fall in love with their team despite their obvious inferiority to the Yankees. And I, for one, prefer women's soccer to men's because the USWNT actually wins major tournaments.

The truth is, people watch the teams they watch because that's what they're accustomed to. It's what their friends watch, what's discussed on the news, what draws crowds and earns parades. So the lack of pay, the lack of press, the lack of attention is something of a self-fulfilling prophesy. As long as we say no one cares about women's sports, no one will care about women's sports.

If you change the narrative to promote equal coverage, women's sports will draw equal attention. Just look at tennis.",A,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"_____

Alright, so, i was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while i am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, i will only do so if you can actually change my mind. I will not give up easily.
I believe I can change this country, better yet, this world for the better. The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution. Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly. We save the weak. I personally believe that we should execute the weak. yes, this sounds harsh but let me explain why. We are not advancing as a race. For now though, we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on. Another massive problem we are facing is over population, we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates.
You look at animals and if an animal doesn't want to eat, it dies, if a human doesn't want to eat, it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder. More importantly that human is allowed to procreate. We allow shitty genetics to be passed on. We SAVE the WEAK. We also allow these morbidly obese, incredibly stupid people live and breed. If an animal in the wild isn't fit, or cannot attract a mate, it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics. Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children, which fucks with the gene pool. I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary i'll continue on later.
Now to determine who is to be executed. The type of people i want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society. If you weigh 500 pounds but you're incredibly smart, you can still make a contribution to society. The opposite is also true, if you're borderline retarded but you're very physically fit, you can also contribute to society. People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn't want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating.
What will determine who is executed: At the age of 14 years old, annual testing will begin based on birthday. There will be three tests, a mental test, a physical test, and a psychological test. Your Mental test exactly 3 months after your birthday and your physical test 9 months after your birthday. Tests will vary depending on your age, the older you get the harder they become, until the age of 20 where they will remain the same until 35 and gradually work their way down until the age of 65 where no further testing will be required. At the age of 20 we will also introduce psychological testing which will continue until the age of 65.
What the tests will consist of: The mental test will be a basic evaluation of your ability to do math, your ability to read and write, and your basic understanding of the sciences. This test should not be difficult, anyone who has at least a D average in school should be just fine. For the physical test, every age group will be required to complete a mile in 16 minutes. This is a very easy time to make, you can walk that pace. Physical tests will include varying push up or sit up tests depending on age group. There may be a few other exercises required in certain age groups, and the amount of repetitions will also vary depending on age. this should be easy for anyone who isn't morbidly obese. Next is the psychological test. These will be administered every 5 years to insure mental stability and health of everyone. We want the mental health of our gene pool to be good as well. Lastly, there will be certain ways to be omitted to testing, ALL WILL BE FROM SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY, the main one being in the military. If you served in the military without being dishonorably discharged, you will be exempt from any further testing in your lifetime. Another example of a way to be omitted from testing is by paying for it. The cost will be $25,000 per year, per person. Many will be angry that it's giving more power to the rich, but i see it as a valid way of determining someones potential for making a contribution to society. If you are rich, I will almost guarantee you are either physically fit enough or mentally fit enough to pass the tests and you would have been fine anyway. AN IMPORTANT NOTE: You will only have to pass 2 out of 3 tests.
How we will execute people: We will set up an organization in charge of carrying out testing and executing people. My idea is to possibly have the military be in charge of this, though I haven't had the time to think too much into that, this I am very open to other ideas on. The method of execution i think will be best is the firing squad. 8 men, 2 with real bullets to ensure death, 6 with blanks for the obvious reason. For those who are unaware, my understanding is that firing squads use primarily blanks so the gunmen aren't aware of who actually killed the person so they don't have trouble with living life after killing someone.
Now another thing i would like to do that isn't executing people, but will improve our gene pool is preventing certain people from having children. People with MORE THAN two generations of diagnosed cancer or potentially terminal illnesses that tend to be passed on genetically will be sterilized. These people will not be allowed to produce offspring, however we will make it easy for them to adopt if they would like to have children.
I would also like to place a limit on the amount of children a person may have. The maximum number of children a person may have is 3, which is a very reasonable amount. It should slow the rate of population increase or possibly make the population decrease due to some couples not having children or only having 1 child. There is no reason to have more than 3 children because at that point you're just putting a burden on society. If say you already have 2 children and you would like to have a third but you end up with twins, triplets, or even more, you will be allowed to keep them as it wasn't your intent to have that many. When you hit the limit for children you will be sterilized.
This is all i can think of for now, if i remember more of my plan i will post. So reddit users, change my view.","I could write two dozen things in opposition to this, but just to gather a few basic points.

-You should understand, if you don't(seems like you don't), that what you're referring is [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics), a field of thought that has existed for about as long as Darwin's theory of evolution has has a long, *very* sordid history.  Most notably, it was one of the primary justifications for Nazi Germany's genocidal practices.

-Despite it's attractiveness to certain political persuasions, [overpopulation is simply not a concern with legitimate scientific backing](https://www.pop.org/content/debunking-myth-overpopulation).  In fact, if the world continues to increase on its path of modernization, democratization and secularism, *under*population is the issue we will have to be concerned.  In highly educated, relatively prosperous societies, birth rates become lower and lower, to the point where they are now beginning to become lower than death rates in some places.  In America, if you excluded immigration, the population would not be growing.  In Japan, it's shrinking and aging outright.  It's only because of the poorer places in the world that population continues to grow substantially, and even then, the worldwide birth rate is shrinking slowly every year.

-There are any number of political oppositions I have to this but I won't get to deep into them as ultimately that's my ethical viewpoint vs. yours.  Needless to say, I think measuring the value of a human being wholly by their ability to produce and work for their country is a fascist viewpoint, and the ability of an individual to pass any kind of mental or psychological test(which undoubtedly would be designed by rich white people) is strongly dependent on the situation and opportunities they grew up with, so it doesn't even remotely approach an accurate genetic test.","You are complaining about humans not letting evolution take place (I'll come to that too), but at the same time you want to counteract what humans evolved to become - supportive of the weak.

The fact that humans help each other out and save the weak (first in tribes, now in nation states) allowed humans to take over the world. You help me now that I'm weak, I help you another time when you're weak. We both survive, instead of neither of us surviving. Remember, it's survival of the fittest, and fittest doesn't necessarily mean strongest.

Now, I don't see how we're not letting evolution take place. Evolution doesn't mean that in every generation only the strongest are allowed to survive. Evolution means that the genes which are most likely to survive through multiple generations in bodies that are likely to reproduce are likely to be spread the most. So if being determined enough to acquire sufficient wealth to be able to reproduce even if you are fat means that you are more likely to reproduce, then that means that that's a gene that's likely to spread, and that's evolution.

And if you really want to solve overpopulation problems, there's far less radical ways to solve that (development help for third world countries etc.). Or just kill everyone who is too old to reproduce.",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesn't exist in any real scientific way.

Let's start off with premise #1

 Everything that is observable in the universe follows laws of nature. All laws of nature follow the universal law of causation, which states that everything in the universe has a cause and is thus an effect of that cause. 

If premise #1 is true then everything in the physical world must be determined. 

If everything is determined than there is no such thing as free will.
If every behaviour is determined by laws of causation it is physically impossible for someone to be free, as that freedom would require the nullification of the laws of causation. In other words to believe in free will is also to believe in spontaneous magic, it's to believe that humans possess powers that could only be explained by the supernatural.

For example: In most legal traditions it is customary to judge whether someone is guilty of x crime by accumulating evidence in order to prove that  x person intentionally did this crime. Let's assume that there was enough evidence to prove without doubt that Greg Smith robbed a convenience store. Now that we have proof that it was Greg, we should ask ourselves if Greg really chose to rob the store. As soon as you ask yourself that kind of question the only scientific recourse you have is to understand Greg as a causal agent. What caused Greg to rob the store? Was it the fact that Greg is from a low socio-economic class? Was it the fact that Greg lost his job 2 weeks ago and Greg wont be able to feed his kids if he doesn't find a way to get more money? Is it the fact that Greg was abused as child? Did Greg rob the store due to complex laws of causality that are reducible to both biological and environmental reasons? Or did Greg simply rob the store because he felt like it?

Even more simple decisions like choosing between a chocolate bar and an apple can be reducible to complex causal interplay between biological and environmental laws. Did you choose the chocolate bar because you like it better? Or is it because we have an evolutionary pull towards sugar and fat dense food? Is it because you read an article on naturalnews.com talking about how dark chocolate can cure your pancreas cancer? Or did you chose the apple because you grew up on an orchard farm and apples remind you of your innocent childhood? or did you choose the apple because you already had psychologically determined bias for foods that will fit in your limited calorie budget for the week?


What I am trying to say is that as soon as you try to define freedom of choice scientifically it inevitably reduce down to causal mechanisms. Whether those casual mechanisms are internal/biological or external/environmental or a mix of both they are the only things that influence us and completely shape our behaviour. Anything else that can be said to have a role in our behaviours (like our ""independent volition"", our ""moral compass"" and all other notions pertaining to freedom of will) is inherently unscientific and can only be explained through a belief in the supernatural.

Everything that is observable in the universe follows laws of nature. All laws of nature follow the universal law of causation, which states that everything in the universe has a cause and is thus an effect of that cause. 

This is backwards. The laws of nature are formulated to explain what we observe. If we observe something that doesn't fit said laws, we find out why or amend the laws to suit our observations.

I leave the rest for you to philosophize over.","&gt;Let's start off with premise #1

If premise #1 is true then everything in the physical world must be determined.

Here is the first issue. The laws of nature we we can best observe them now include the fact that there are stochastic processes, random events. This strongly implies that reality is not deterministic. It is not that things are determined and we just cant measure them, things like the Double Slit Experiment reveal to us that we cannot have both local realism and hidden variables (controlling the result of the seemingly random event).",B,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B brings up the important point that there are stochastic processes and random events in the universe, which suggests that reality is not completely deterministic. This challenges the idea that everything is determined and therefore there is no free will. By pointing out the existence of randomness in the universe, Reply B introduces the possibility of free will existing outside of strict causal determinism. 

On the other hand, Reply A focuses more on the relationship between observations and the formulation of laws of nature. While this is a valid point, it doesn't directly address the issue of determinism and free will as effectively as Reply B does. 

Overall, Reply B's argument is more likely to make the original poster reconsider their views on free will and determinism."
predict-explain,"Hi.

Whenever I read about people trying to 

- increase the number of women in science or engineering
- increase the number of women in politics
- increase the number of women in positions of power
- increase the number of women that are firefighters or police

I can't help feeling that it is a rather useless cause. I have no problem at all with there being less women than men in any place. What I would (and do) have a problem with is women having it more difficult than men to enter certain professions. That is the real problem we should, as a society, try to solve.

The current approach is ""forcing"" the proportion of women to increase, by means of: 

- gender-specific student grants, 
- positions reserved for women, 
- lower physical requirements,
- etc.

As I see it this kind of solutions are problematic in two ways:

- They involve so-called ""positive discrimination"", which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman. This is absurd and can increase animosity in the male coworkers. Admittedly, that would be wrong on their part, but it still can create an hostile work environment.

- They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. 

The only benefits I see is that ""artificially"" increasing the number of women in certain places may make the presence of women in said place appear less ""unusual"" to society, thereby decreasing the discrimination, but I still think they do more harm than good.

Reddit, change my view!

PD: English is not my first language, so I apologize for any awkwardly phrased sentence I may have written, and welcome any correction. 

EDIT: In only a few hours there have been a lot of great answers that have confirmed my feeling that this was a more nuanced issue that I could even imagine. My view has been changed in that I had underestimated the benefits of this kind of measures. In particular I now see that:

- Artificially increasing the number of women in certain fields makes said fields much less ""threatening"" to other women.
- Makes male coworkers appreciate the capabilities of women, decreasing further discrimination.
- Improves the selection process by eliminating male-favoring biases. Whenever a man less prepared than a woman would have got the position by conscious or unconscious biases a well-prepared woman will get it.

I remain unconvinced that physical tests should have easier versions for women. Most people seemed to agree with me on this, though. I have realized, however, that jobs that at first seem to be mainly physical (police, firefighters, ...) would also benefit from having more women. 

Some of my favourite answers, where you can find studies supporting all of this, are:

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","&gt; I can't help feeling that it is a rather useless cause. 

I don't think it is. Every field that is dominantly one gender over another is going to miss out on talented people with novel insights. We shouldn't miss out on a qualified nurse because some bloke was told it wasn't a manly profession. Neither should we miss out on a qualified scientists because some girl was told science was for boys.

Unless you have a good argument as for why certain genders are almost universally better at certain professions any sort of gender imbalance is going to cause society missing out on qualified people in the right place.

And I think the police force is a special case, in this regard. I've seen firsthand how some people react to both male and female police officers and having a good gender balance is going to help civilians a lot. A lot of people are more comfortable discussing certain things with people from their own gender. Children will gravitate towards female police officers (and yes, this is also due to harmful gender roles in society, but we need a police that functions in the society we live in, not in the society we'd like to live in). 

&gt; They involve so-called ""positive discrimination"", which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman.

People often say this when talking about this, but I don't think this is completely true. We know from several studies that when applying for, well, anything, people are discriminated against based on their gender, skin color, sexuality, etc. Even if the resumes are completely identical, this still happens. So if a woman wants to enter a male dominated field, there's a good chance she's going to have to be **more** qualified than a man. Positive discrimination is intended to get (in this case) women accepted when they are ""merely"" equally qualified. 

&gt; They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. 

And as soon as we have good, viable way to stop the discrimination from happening at all, we should implement that. Unfortunately, we don't have one and we'll have to make do with measures we can actually implement.","One of the ways to combat the underlying problem is to ensure those who can combat it are in the right places. That means, in this case, creating a countervailing bias to fix the original one.

People have biases about how well women can do a job?  Putting women in those jobs will convince them they are wrong.

Women are less willing to enter a field because it is male dominated?  Temporary positive discrimination will fix them problem.",A,A,"I would say that reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a clear and concise argument for why positive discrimination can be a necessary step in combating underlying biases and discrimination. It addresses the issue of countervailing bias and the importance of representation in breaking down stereotypes and societal norms. Reply A also makes valid points, but reply B directly addresses the concerns raised by the original poster and provides a compelling argument for why positive discrimination can be a valuable tool in creating more equal opportunities."
predict-explain,"I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form.

The facts are:

* McDonalds brewed (and continues to brew) coffee at standard brewing temperatures of 200F 
* McDonalds holds and serves its coffee after brewing between 170-180F (which is no different than most other restaurants)
* McDonalds has *NOT* lowered the temperature of their coffee, nor have the changed the temps at which they hold and serve coffee

To me, the purchaser of coffee acknowledges the fact that they're buying near-boiling water when they decided ""hey, I want coffee"". Change my view, please.

[sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants)


EDIT:

Looks like I screwed up by questioning the frivolousness of the case. Even if the blame doesn't lie on McDonalds, the case does not seem to be frivolous in the slightest. This was an easy one. Thanks guys.","Frivolous has a very limited meaning, and this lawsuit does not qualify.  To be frivolous, a lawsuit must have no merit.  But here, McDonald's deliberately set the temperature of their coffee to one that could cause tissue damage (&gt;110 degrees F).  Had they set that coffee to a temperature under 110, it would be highly unlikely that any damage would have ensued.  So they are at least partially at fault in any scald injury.  Liebeck did indeed suffer a scald injury, and she did so by exposure to hot McDonald's coffee.  With those elements satisfied (McDonald's had a duty to safeguard its customers, it took an action that conflicted with that duty, she suffered injury, and the injury was caused by McDonalds' action), the case is not frivolous.

We might want to live in a world in which coffee can be served above 110F without fear of lawsuits.  I happen to enjoy McDonald's coffee.  That desire doesn't change the definition of frivolous, however.","Frivolousness (the actual legal term) is a really high bar. 

There are two types, factual and legal frivolousness.  For factual frivolousness the Supreme Court [has held the standard to be as follows.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9141408508548092395)

&gt;[A] court may dismiss a claim as factually frivolous only if the facts alleged are ""clearly baseless,"" 490 U. S., at 327, a category encompassing allegations 33*33 that are ""fanciful,"" id., at 325, ""fantastic,"" id., at 328, and ""delusional,"" ibid. As those words suggest, a finding of factual frivolousness is appropriate when the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible, whether or not there are judicially noticeable facts available to contradict them.

This case is clearly not factually frivolous under that standard.  The facts alleged were that the plaintiff was burned (true) by coffee that was hot (true), that was above industry temperature standards (a plausible assertion of fact), and that McDonald's willfully made its coffee hotter than standard (a plausible assertion of fact).

As far as legal frivolousness, this is defined [as follows:](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=868429855339617087&amp;q=legal+merit+frivolous&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33)

&gt;an appeal on a matter of law is frivolous where none of the legal points are arguable on their merits.

In this case, there was at least a plausible case for tort negligence based on the alleged facts.  It might be a case that's a likely loser, but as long as there's some level of sane argument to be made, it's not frivolous.",B,A,"I would say that reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because reply A provides a clear explanation of why the lawsuit against McDonald's was not frivolous, citing specific elements that need to be present for a lawsuit to be considered frivolous. Reply A also acknowledges that McDonald's had a duty to safeguard its customers and that their actions conflicted with that duty, leading to the injury suffered by Liebeck. This logical and structured argument is more likely to convince the original poster to reconsider their view on the lawsuit."

4. The universe doesn't care about how we feel. No one is protecting us. If I'm falling onto spikes, universe is not gonna pull me away and protect me, no matter how hard I pray.

To clarify: Most people seem to think that life is inherently good and some sort of ""precious gift"", which just isn't true. Life is fundamentally shit, but happiness is possible.","Suffering isn't the default, doing stuff is. 

Millions of years ago, we did shit to survive. We hunted wooly mammoths and looked for berries and stuff. 

As time went on we discovered farming and we settled down, so we didn't need to do as much so we had more free time but we still had needs like shelter and friendship so we kept doing shit. 

Fast forward to 2015, we still need to do shit but not as much. Exercise is an option not a fact of life. We don't need to look for berries we got Safeway, we don't need to kill a pig found in the wild, we just buy pork. We don't need to build a home we just rent it. We don't even need to go to a friends house or hear their voice to talk , we got texting, Facebook ect. 

My point is that it is not the default to be bored, we have just been spoiled as a species.","I'll address each of your points.

&gt; #1 Boredom is the default mood. Mere existence isn't enough to satisfy us, we constantly have to distract ourselves from boredom.

I disagree. Humans are pack animals. If you are with your ""clan"" (friends, family, etc), you should not be bored. Most humans find enjoyment simply from being around people they like. If you do not, then you are in the minority. If you are alone, then you will feel boredom. This is because humans are not meant to be secluded.

&gt; #2 Pleasure requires effort, suffering does not. I literally don't have to do anything to suffer from boredom and starvation.

I disagree as well. For me, pleasure comes easily. I will talk to a stranger and get pleasure, listen to a song and get pleasure, eat a nice meal and get pleasure. There isn't much effort I'm putting in. When I'm not putting in effort, I don't feel suffering. If you have a good 2-3 hours of pleasure, 1-2 hours of alone-time shouldn't make you fail pain. Food is also easy to come by nowadays and is in abundance. That's not an issue, so it's worthless to discuss.

&gt; #3 Suffering is more powerful feeling than pleasure. Is there an opposite to a cluster headache

In my opinion, you underrate pleasure. If your mother dies, you feel immense suffering. That's not because the value of human life weighs so much on your soul that you can't bare to see a person die. It's because of the all the pleasure that person brought you. You feel pain, because you miss the pleasure.

It's the same thing with a cluster headache. You underrate the good feeling of having a clear head and feeling ""normal"". Cluster headaches hurt so much because normal feelings are so good. With normal feelings in your head, you can come up with amazing ideas, formulas, etc that make you feel immense joy. You take that for granted.

&gt; #4 The universe doesn't care about how we feel. No one is protecting us. If I'm falling onto spikes, universe is not gonna pull me away and protect me, no matter how hard I pray.

The universe is not some sentient being with feelings. Saying that the universe doesn't care about you falling onto spikes is the same as saying the playground didn't care that you broke your arm while on the slide. The universe doesn't have feelings. Dying is a part of life. It is the equal to birth. Birth is the best thing that can happen to you and death is the worst. Sure, you could wish you were never alive to have never felt suffering, but at the same time, you would never have felt joy.

I suggest you

1. Read ""The Giver"". It's a children's book, but it's fantastic and tells a story based on your theories.

2. See a psychologist. You seemingly suffer from depression or anxiety which is fixable.",A,A,"I would say reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B addresses each of the original poster's points in a logical and thoughtful manner, providing counterarguments and offering a different perspective. Additionally, reply B suggests seeking help from a psychologist, showing empathy and concern for the original poster's well-being. This approach is more likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially lead to a shift in their viewpoint."
predict-explain,"So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument.
All modern economic transactions involving physical items (no stocks, capital, etc.) can be simplified down to a trade of money for labor. Yes, you can buy an item off the shelf at someplace like Target, but what you're really buying is the labor involved in making that item, the item being the end result of it. In other words, it is impossible to buy a physical item that is not shaped and made valuable by labor. In this sense, what you do when you walk to a pizzaria and buy a pizza is *directly* contract the labor of the pizza maker in exchange for money (as opposed to indirect contracting through a store, e.g. DiGornios). Because of this, businesses should have the right to refuse to labor for any particular individual, *for any reason*. If this is NOT the case, and some outside authority can force a person to preform labor they don't wish to preform, that could be seen as a type of slavery (I hate to use the term), because an outside authority is forcing a person, under the threat of force, to labor, even when that person doesn't want to.  
So prove me wrong everyone, help me come to better formulate and understand my own ideas! That's what this sub is about, after all.
Please excuse the weird grammar and sentence structure, I just woke up","In a capitalist system, the person who would be making decisions about who the business serves is most often not the person who is actually dealing with the customers.  So in most cases this discrimination would involve a boss telling his employees not to serve certain people.  In a hypothetical non-capitalist, non-hierarchal society (whether or not you believe such a society would be feasible), this might be more about free association, and non-discrimination laws might not be as necessary as you could ask any other worker to help you.  But in a capitalist world, there is a higher risk that a business owner could be preventing a certain group of people from accessing an important resource.  And I can't see it as ""enslaving"" a business owner to prevent him or her from having a policy that certain groups of people should be refused service.","I think it is ludicrous for a business to turn away customers for irrelevant matters.  Doing so, to me means you're no longer so much in the business of making money, you're now making a political statement. You're essentially giving your customers a litmus test and if they pass you allow them to purchase your services. 


Giving employees such tests is illegal, why should it be legal to apply the same sort of tests to customers? 


These laws protect consumers. End of story. These people are not going into establishments and ordering non-menu items, they're not walking into Muslim owned diners and demanding pork, they're not going to subway and demanding a big mac,  they're not being unreasonable in the slightest. Therefore I believe that it is the government's duty to protect these people.",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B provides a strong argument for why businesses should not be allowed to refuse service to certain individuals based on irrelevant matters. Reply B highlights the importance of protecting consumers and argues that allowing businesses to discriminate against certain groups is essentially making a political statement rather than focusing on making money. Additionally, Reply B points out the inconsistency in allowing businesses to apply tests to customers that would be illegal to apply to employees. Overall, Reply B presents a clear and logical argument for why anti-discrimination laws are necessary to protect consumers."
predict-explain,"* As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.  
* Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic.
* Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. 
* I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the ""warm glow"" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. 
* Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture. Because of climate change, and the overuse of farmlands we may reach that point in the near future.

The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. 

To get to the point where they are dead, they have suffered.  Not treating their illness means more suffering and since we could have prevented it, its unnecessary suffering.  

Doesn't your justification support not treating any chronic illness for adults and children?  Why not adults too?  Would you accept death from a chronic illness because of population control or ""you won't turn out to be anyone and most likely you are a socialpath""?","At least in the USA, the government is a democracy, in which all people should have a say. The government should therefore mirror all its peoples' interests. The group for chronically ill does exist, so is it not fair that they at least receive some recognition in government? If people have an interest in having government-subsidized chronic disease healthcare then the government should at least somewhat represent those people.

When one observes the art and literature left behind from the Black Death, one can see that the people were suffering. Grotesque images of the infected as well as hysteria over what caused the disease ran rampant. The misery of the general public could not be understated, as a force outside their control killed their loved ones without discretion. If such a kind of suffering was to happen, and people knew exactly who was to blame, is it not reasonable to conclude that deaths of chronically ill which affected people would cause the affected to conduct civil unrest?

The argument that GDP will increase is somewhat flawed by itself. The government has actually produced something known as a stimulus check to boost consumer spending in times of recession. Taxdollars which go through the government would still increase the country's GDP because the government still spends money on subsidizing chronic medication. If the proposed system of removing government funding was introduced, then that same money would instead go directly to charities and thereby go to health expenditure. The GDP would remain the same because the government no longer is allowed to tax for chronic illness in the proposed system. The government would still keep the same amount of usable revenue because of an equal decrease in expenditures and an equal decrease in revenue.

In addition to this, chronic illness can range from ~~mile~~ mild to immediate death upon removal of medication. Those people who have chronic asthma aren't really burdening society, but their malady can still be classified as chronic. How does one draw the line between that and something more severe, like crohn's disease? Some people who would otherwise be happily be living would be killed in the name of euthanization. If the government was to apply this same principle to other minority groups, the government might as well kill all seniors over 80 years of age. Obviously, they were suffering from old age, right? 80 years is definitely the right cutoff age and is definitely not an arbitrarily drawn number, right?",A,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a more comprehensive and detailed response, addressing various aspects of the original post such as the impact on GDP, the role of government in representing all people's interests, the potential for civil unrest, and the ethical implications of removing government funding for chronic illness.

I watched the documentary on A-Sexualism and I'm not convinced. I think these people that identify as ""asexual"" either haven't found the 'right' person for them yet, are just looking for attention, or just joining part of a trend to seem 'interesting' or 'different'. I think if you're born with a set of a genitals, you are in fact a sexual being and in turn, feel some sexual attraction to other humans. I understand how this can be offensive. I look at my brother who is gay and I understand where he comes from, and the obstacles he overcomes through being gay, and I just can't sympathize with people who identify as 'asexual' and implicate that they endure the same struggles as someone from the LBGT community. Please change my view!","&gt; I think if you're born with a set of a genitals, you are in fact a sexual being and in turn, feel some sexual attraction to other humans.

You're making the same leap in logic that people make regarding sex change operations.  *""If you have a penis, you're a boy.  If you have vagina, you're a girl""*.  It's definitely *easier* to dismiss someone's ideas than to consider them, but that doesn't make it accurate.

&gt;  I just can't sympathize with people who identify as 'asexual' and implicate that they endure the same struggles as someone from the LBGT community

Why would that be?  Sexuality is strongly tied to identity.  

Imagine all of the cues that society gives a person who is sexual sexual. Everything from who they are having sex with (IE disparities in attractiveness, age, race, etc) is scrutinized.  Also the kinds of sex that you are open about having strictly helps to categorize you somewhere in the system.  Almost everything about sex is in some public sense taboo.  

Even without sex, there's a lot of bonding among men and women (separately or together) regarding sexuality.  Just looking at an attractive person passing you by and nodding to your buddy.  Or discussing events, celebrations or just making up.  Sex is a common topic of discussion.

Then there's the media.  Sexuality drives us to buy everything from beer to gym memberships.  It's a tool which is used because it works.  If it didn't work on you, you would find it more than just superfluous, it would be frustrating to be exposed to it regularly.


It is a factor of identity which is deeply ingrained in society and ubiquitous in daily life.  If a person does not feel a sex drive, everything from social bonding, to reactions to commercials to meeting social expectations would be impacted.","Being asexual is definitely not a choice. While some kids may ""try on"" asexuality just like some kids experiment with bisexual or gay relationships in their early years, it's something that wears on you over time. If there is one solid expectation of you in society, it's that everyone wants to get laid. Sex is such an integral part of our relationships and our perceived value in relationships. Can you think of the last time you got aroused? Can you imagine *never* having been aroused? Isn't it such a strange thought?

That's how many asexuals feel about the idea of sexual attraction. It's *strange* and foreign. And because we have that powerful disconnect from something which is a strong underlying motivation for the human existence, we're constantly being judged in our relationships--from friendships, to family, and of course our partners as well. 

Many asexuals find the right person for them, but the relationship isn't viable because a sexual connection is very important for most people. Even if an asexual is willing to have sex, it's never going to be that powerful ""perfect fit"" sex that partners with good chemistry have. 

People are extremely uncomfortable at the idea of asexuality. It's definitely not something you can choose.


####*personal anecdote follows*


I'm 30 years old and asexual. This is a throwaway. I've come to strongly resent my asexuality at this point in my life. Maybe because I spent most of my life trying to ignore it, then trying to fix it, and then ultimately concluding that I am stuck with it.

I've went my entire life and felt no physical attraction to another human being, and it's a really hard concept for a lot of people to understand. I've actually had my mother tell me ""I wish you were gay just so I could understand!"" and that's difficult to hear because that's right up there with being a satanist for her (conservative roots here).

I think there is definitely some people that participate in sexual ""trends"" per se as they are growing older and finding their sexual identity. It's just a natural part of experimenting and finding out about your own body and what you like. Or, maybe people think because they've never been laid that they must clearly be asexual because that seems like a better club to be in than undesirable.

You really start noticing a gap between you and your friends very quickly, though. There's different shades of asexuality, but I remember so clearly being that weird kid who was completely uninterested in sex but that many people found very attractive. Emotionally, I can connect to other people like anyone else. While I didn't desire sex, I desired to make an emotional connection. So I dated... and dated, and dated. When I was young, I had the excuse that (being in a conservative area), I was waiting for marriage even though I wasn't religious at all. As you can imagine, though, this gets pretty old with young kids wanting to rut everywhere. I got talked about a lot, and not in a good way. 

As an adult, I didn't really have any excuses anymore. I went to see sex therapists, regular therapists, doctors, and anyone else who would listen trying to fix myself. Medically, there's nothing wrong with me.

I stopped dating for a long time. I came to realize that for most other people, sex was a necessary part of a relationship and that they couldn't feel connected without it. That thought was as alien to me as my lack of sexuality was to my boyfriends.

I've been dating my fiance for three years now. Emotionally, we have a really powerful bond but physically I struggle. We do have sex, sometimes. It's tedious and unpleasant for me but I try to make it nice for him. I like cuddling afterwards because I feel like I've endured something that has brought us closer together.

I was born here in the US but I am of Chinese and Thai descent. As a child I grew up not really caring at all about race, I just sort of assumed humans came is all different colors and shapes and that was normal.

As I grew older, my classmates and I were bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else. We were taught that white people were somehow inherently racist. We were taught that everyone else was perfect and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified. I started to see lines forming. White kids were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did. Black kids were taught that they were owed something. I noticed kids start self-segregating. It wasn't anything dramatic, no one attributed this to the things we were being taught, but people knew they were different now. 

I grew older still. I started paying attention to the news and the internet,. Race was discussed alot. I learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil. If you didn't know, Asians are hurt the most by affirmative action. I would need a MUCH higher SAT score and GPA than a black person to get into the schools of my choice. I started to resent black people for this. Why was I being hurt because an entire race was apparently performing poorly and my entire race wasn't? And if discrimination was the reason, well my race was discriminated against in the past too! This was opinion shared by my friends. It led us to think that if this was the case, black people didn't try very much and were lazy in school. Otherwise why would they need help? I was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and wasn't even close to the top of the class was accepted into my first choice college while I was not, despite my excellent grades and test scores. When I went to college, I made sure to avoid going to black doctors and other black professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences.

I learned about the black crime rate, and prison population. I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the streets. All the commentary about how this was racist merely solidified my opinion. I saw how violent black neighborhoods are, I was catcalled constantly by black men in the streets, I worked in a leasing office and saw black tenants who lived entirely off the government and complained about everything. If I hadn't heard about race my entire life I would have written all these off as ""Man those specific people suck"" rather than lump the entire race together. People address these issues as if everyone else is to blame for these peoples actions, instead of saying hey, those are just bad people. Instead they make it a race thing where those bad people are actually VICTIMS. I heard about the police shootings and the publicity around them. I heard about the riots, and the more people talked about how the senseless destruction was justified the more I distanced myself and the more scared I became. I started to involuntarily see black people as a threat. My friends all secretly talked about how they wished all these people would go back to Africa so we could all live in peace. In the past couple years after all the discussion about race I have seen SOO many non-black people become essentially racist, and so many wonderful black people become entitled and vitriolic.

So basically, I feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans, rather than african-american, asian american, etc, racism would soon become a thing of the past. If we keep bringing up race in EVERYTHING, kids start drawing lines and lumping people together as their race, rather than as Americans. They start noticing and being hyper-aware of differences between races. Crying racism in every situation just annoys people and defeats the goal of ending racism. Racial and diversity programs make people resentful, and make the benefitting parties feel entitled. People should be chosen on merit alone. ""Not seeing color"" is treated as ignorant and is laughed at, but I feel that this is the best way to operate if we are ever going to solve our problems.

I'd like other opinions on this because the way I see the world right now truly sickens me. I don't want to keep feeling like I am different because I am Asian, I want to feel American and be okay with the way people talk about race. I want to feel okay with the way we as Americans are dealing with these issues. I also want to understand why ""not seeing color"" is ridiculed.","While disappointing, I cannot say your view is unique here on reddit or anywhere else in the country, so I'm glad you're here on CMV.

&gt; &gt; 

Could you provide examples of this? As someone who is black, I was never taught that I was ""owed"" anything. I was also never taught that all white people are responsible for the hideous injustices of the past.

&gt; I grew older still. I started paying attention to the news and the internet,. Race was discussed alot. I learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil.

While I am not a supporter of AA, it is often a misunderstood policy.

Pretend you have 2 little league football coaches:

Coach 1 takes over a team that was 2-12, and at the end of the season has a score of 8-6

Coach 2 takes over a team that was 7-7, and at the end of the season that is 10-4

I want to hire the most qualified coach. If I just look at what their current seasons were, I would have to go with Coach 2. Coach 2 clearly has a superior record to Coach 1. However, is Coach 2 really more qualified? 

Coach 1 obviously had to begin with a *much* worse team than Coach 2. If I honestly want the best coach, it would be foolish not to take that into account.

The idea behind AA is that we take into account peoples starting positions. This is where the confusion is. If an average white kid gets a score of 1980 on the SAT, and an average black kid gets a score of 1800, the argument isn't that the less qualified black person should get the spot. The argument is that the black student ***is*** the more qualified student. The idea is that we can't just look at the test scores in a vacuum, and that if the black student was raised in the same circumstance, they would have scored much higher.

The reason to not support AA isn't because it hurts the students getting passed over, but because it often hurts the students being let in. Even if we concede that a black kid being raised by a single mom working 2 jobs is at a supreme disadvantage, if we let that kid into an advanced school, it still doesn't change the fact that they don't have the skillset to be able to perform in that environment. Being a good student is learned behavior, and it is very unlikely this kid was taught how to be a good student. They simply won't be able to perform, no matter how smart they are, due to their upbringing.


&gt; And if discrimination was the reason, well my race was discriminated against in the past too! This was opinion shared by my friends. It led us to think that if this was the case, black people didn't try very much and were lazy in school. Otherwise why would they need help? I was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and wasn't even close to the top of the class was accepted into my first choice college while I was not, despite my excellent grades and test scores. When I went to college, I made sure to avoid going to black doctors and other black professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences.

Asians certainly delt with discrimination in the US. However, the discrimination faced was far less severe and couldn't have as large an effect on their population. This is due to most Asian Americans voluntarily coming here, meaning you have a *very* significant selection factor going on. To put it bluntly, most asians already came here with marketable skills(otherwise they would never have made it here). When you have marketable skills, discrimination is far less effective a means to harm people. Here is a good video explaining this:

https://youtu.be/Eu_bKJ11O0M?t=3m23s


If you no longer want to go to black professionals because of this, that's your business. But I feel the need to remind you that getting into the college doesn't net you a degree. You still need to pass the classes and graduate, and black students don't get AA while professors are grading their exams.

&gt; I learned about the black crime rate, and prison population. I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the streets.

You need to be careful with how you interpret statistics. The reason that most people will charge people who cite these statistics racist is because they are usually trying to cite them to present a narrative of the black thug, and do very little to interpret any statistic honestly. Here is a related example.

Imagine you have a small asian town in California that kidnaps people that pass by and cannibalizes them. They do this for an entire year, kidnapping around 50 people.

When they're caught, and then convicted of this heinous act, later that year I release a headline:

**98% of all cannibalism cases committed by asians**.

This would be a true statement statistically. Since cannibalism is a very rare crime, this town would responsible for almost 100 percent of the cannibalism cases. However, this is disingenuous to say the least. Me presenting the headline in that manner suggests that asians everywhere are to be feared. Seeing an asian in Vermont might cause people to be cautious that that person would eat them. By printing it I would *knowingly* be spreading misinformation, while technically not telling a single lie.

As for the black crime rate, most of it is concentrated in very specific high crime areas. You could look at the murder rate the same way we looked at cannibalism. It is, when dealing with a country of 330 million, a rare crime. In 2013 there were about 14,000 murders total. If half of those were black males, that is *still* only 7000. If we are **generous** and say all those murders were committed by unique individuals, we still have 7000 males out of how many millions? This means that 99.9% of black people you  meet have never killed anyone, and will never kill anyone. Sure, you could say that for other races it is 99.99, or 99.999, but 0.01 is still an infinitesimal amount of people no matter how you slice it. To top it off the bulk of these murders can again be traced back to about a dozen or so places. Most of them dealing with drugs. The idea that black people are just running around killing everyone is a myth. To make it more personal, has any black person ever put their hands on you? Assaulted you? Murdered someone you know? My guess is no, and it will probably never happen.

Another common misconception seen on reddit is ""black people kill white people like 10 bajilliion times more than white people kill black people."" Technically true, but misleading. Let's leave out the fact that gross population differences will screw with these numbers, as this post is long enough as is, and just stick with the same line of reasoning as before. In 2013, the amount of whites murdered by blacks was around 350. Not 350,000, not 3500....350. If you're white in this country the chances of a black person killing you is essentially zero percent. You're 10 times more likely to die of food poisoning, and how often are you worried about that?

&gt; So basically, I feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans, rather than african-american, asian american, etc, racism would soon become a thing of the past

It's odd that you say this, while admitting earlier that you're a racist. Racism cannot be solved by simply ignoring it. If you think it can, then indulge me with examples of *any* problem with society that was changed through people ignoring the problem. I'd be surprised if you could give me a singe example.","Most people who have some privilege (whether that be class, race, gender ect.) grow up in a bubble to some degree or another. We think that the world is in basically good shape, and that since we don't have obvious problems like Jim Crow or men stoning their wives, social justice has basically prevailed to the most reasonable extent.

If you're a women, it doesn't take long for that bubble to be popped. You will probably feel that you're systematically treated differently from men, and in many cases, treated worse. If you're black, you'll probably feel that you're treated differently than other races, often times much worst. If you're poor, -and so on. In your case, it was obvious that that asians are treated differently than other people. It's a cruel perversion of reasoning when the stereotype that ""asians are smart"" is used to disenfranchise them.

These bubbles don't pop all at once though, what if your on the other end of one of the many inequalities society presents? What if you happen to be middle class, or white, or cis or male? A lot of times it's the same thing. We come out of childhood and realise that ""Oh shit, society is still kinda fucked. We should probably do something about this."" And, that's uncomfortable, but kind of necessary.

Our default reaction to questioning the way we live is usually, anger, annoyance, or disbelief. We don't want to think about fact that the lifestyle we've been living all our lives *might* be contributing to massive social harm. We're scared of being a bad person. Which is understandable. In the bubble, we believe we're a good normal person.

You can be a good person outside of the bubble. Even if you're going to involuntarily profit off of some parts of a broken system for the rest of your life, you can still define yourself by your actions and not the circumstances of your birth. But that takes some seriously uncomfortable internal debate. You have to seriously think about what is not okay in the world, and what you're going to do about it. It's a lot easier to say fuck you to who ever brought all this up and stay in your bubble.

Example, few people like to think about whether eating meat is wrong. We just say, meat is NORMAL, why are we even TALKING ABOUT THIS? It's not like it's impossible to have a debate about whether eating animals is okay, and still come out of that thinking meat is fine to eat, or at least, that you're not necessarily a bad person for doing so. But we'd rather not even entertain the possibility.

So if we all stay in our bubbles and indeed school our children to do so, is institutionalized racism against asians ever really going to end? If we can't even debate whether or not things like racism exist in the world, how can we hope to be on the right side of it?

If this reasoning helped at all, it's mostly paraphrased from [Why Are You So Angry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExEHuNrC8yU). The video is a lot more eloquent than I am.

As one last note on the topic of affirmative action, and reverse racism generally. It's possible for a black privilege and a white privilege to exist simultaneously. That doesn't somehow mean the scales are balanced. It just means the world is complicated and there's even more to consider now.",A,A,"I would say Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B addresses the original poster's concerns and provides a thoughtful explanation of privilege and systemic issues. It encourages the original poster to consider their own biases and the impact of societal inequalities. Additionally, Reply B offers a comparison to a different social issue (eating meat) to help illustrate the importance of questioning societal norms and values. Overall, Reply B provides a more nuanced and empathetic perspective that may resonate with the original poster."
predict-explain,"If movies and video games are subject to regulation and censorship, then books should be too.

In many places, especially in western cultures, the censorship of books is looked down upon. Many consider it a restriction of free speech and ideas. But why do people get upset with the censorship of books, and not movies or video games?
If you are under the age of 17, you are not allowed to see a rated “R” movie without a parent. But you are allowed to go to a bookstore and buy any book you want, no matter how controversial the subject matter. Why is it okay to censor movies and not books? Like books, movies contain ideas, messages, and provoke thought and conversation. I have seen movies that have changed my way of thinking. Most of those movies are rated “R”. How is it fair to restrict teenagers from experiencing the stories and ideas of this particular medium, while allowing those same stories and ideas through literature?

The same thing goes for video games. There are video games that have been banned from western countries because of content. Oftentimes, game developers have been forced to edit the content in games (depict less blood or sexuality) in order to legally sell their product in a country. This is censorship, plain and simple. They are banning art and ideas because they are controversial and make people uncomfortable. Could you imagine what would happen if we did this with books? Banned them unless the author edited, rewrote, or removed certain scenes? There would be an uproar.

Here is a list of some video games that have either been censored or banned in certain countries:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regionally_censored_video_games[1]

Some people might argue that we are stricter with movies and video games because you can actually see the violence rather than just reading about it. But I don’t really buy this argument. In high school, I had to read “The Sorrow of War” by Bao Ninh. For those of you who haven’t read it, the book is extremely graphic and violent. There were vivid descriptions of people stabling and shooting each other in the face, tanks running over and crushing bodies, and torture. One of the main characters is raped in graphic detail. Profanities, including words like “Fuck” “Shit” and “Cunt” are everywhere. The fact that a 16 year old is allowed and encouraged to read this book, while at the same time banned from watching 22 Jump Street in theaters alone (a movie that is rated R solely because of the language”), is baffling.

To be clear, I do not agree with regulation and censorship at all. But since we enforce it on games and movies, I think that books should be held to the same standard. CMV.","I think there's an important distinction between age limits and outright censorship.  ""Censorship"" in the political sense means that you are suppressing or editing a book, movie, or another work on the basis of the words and ideas contained inside it being deemed ""unacceptable"" by some authority figure.  The problem with censorship is that it abridges the freedom of adults to choose the media they consume and to expose themselves to whatever content they want.  


MPAA and RIAA ratings, on the other hand, are age limits that apply only to children under 17.  They aren't removing these movies or video games from the marketplace of ideas, or even preventing children from seeing them.  They are just giving parents the choice about whether to expose their children to those media, rather than allowing children to have that choice themselves.  Rightly or wrongly, children under the age of 17 are under the guardianship of their parents, and our society and our legal system gives parents to make certain choices on behalf of their children until they reach a certain age.  You can argue that age 17 is arbitrary, but I think most people would agree that children below SOME age are not really capable of deciding themselves what media is appropriate to consume.  So then it's just a question of picking where the arbitrary age cutoff is.


Age limits on books are actually quite common.  It is illegal for example, to sell erotica to children, and many bookstore chains have also adopted their own content limits in terms of what books they'll sell to young kids.  Parent groups and others will often force schools and libraries to ban certain titles (or to remove them from school curricula) for putative ""graphic content"" or political controversy.  Morally, this doesn't seem to me much different from the MPAA/RIAA rating systems; the only real difference is that it's done on an ad-hoc basis at the consumer level, rather than nationally by an industry-wide board.


Also, I agree with u/forestfly1234 that the layer of interpretation needed to understand graphic content in books provides another layer of protection (generally, in my experience as a teacher, kids who are old enough to understand what they're reading are usually old enough to handle the content, and the same is definitely not true of movies.)","If you're reading a book you have to interpret what you're reading. If you a six year old read a rape scene and have no idea what a rape scene actually entails you're probably going to not really understand what that scene is trying to depict. 

The kid is protected by not having any idea as to what he is reading, so the rape scene has no context for him. He probably is protected because he can't read the thing in the first place. Books provide protection that movies and games don't.

If I show the movie Hostel to a 6 year old the violence is already really dedicated for him. That kid just has to sit back and watch. he isn't protected by his ignorance. Everything is just laid out to see. 

Should 6 year olds be able to watch Hostel?",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a clear distinction between age limits and censorship, pointing out that age limits are in place to protect children and give parents the choice of what media their children are exposed to. The argument is logical and acknowledges the need for some level of protection for children. It also highlights that age limits on books do exist, contrary to the original poster's belief. 

Reply B, on the other hand, focuses on the idea that books provide protection through the need for interpretation, but it doesn't address the overall argument as effectively as Reply A. It also uses an extreme example (showing a 6-year-old the movie Hostel) which may not be directly relevant to the original poster's argument. 

Overall, Reply A provides a more comprehensive and logical argument that is likely to make the original poster consider a different perspective on the issue."
predict-explain,"* As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.  
* Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic.
* Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. 
* I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the ""warm glow"" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. 
* Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture. Because of climate change, and the overuse of farmlands we may reach that point in the near future.

The first is the utter lack of empathy. Having a child with sever medical problems is incredibly taxing. It could happen to anyone through no fault of their own, and as such we have decided as a society to spread that risk around to limit its severity. 

The second flaw is ignoring the fallout from not assisting in any way. You're taking one of the most powerful motivating forces in a humans life, the well being of their child, and placing them in a situation where they have no *legal* recourse to saving it.

You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that mainly talk about how the other party/candidate would be bad for this country, the ads I have a problem with are **endorsed** by a political party that used taxpayer money to attack another political party. I think that to use taxpayer to further your own agenda is wrong.

I think that instead of using money to fund public dialogues that they can put on public networks, this would allow them to talk about what problems they have with other parties with the the other parties having the ability to respond and rebuttle if they have proof that they are wrong.

The problem stems from drawing the line between what is attack and what is legitimate criticism.  If you were to say you're not allowed to criticize your opponent, then that would give the incumbent party a clear advantage, as no matter how poorly they govern or how harmful their policies, the opposition parties wouldn;t be allowed to criticize them or their policies.  Say they slashed education spending in half, laying off thousands of teachers and closing down hundreds of schools, causing overcrowding and poor performance.  Shouldn't the opposition be able to draw attention to that?  So, lets say you're allowed to criticize.  At what point does it become an ""attack""?  Tone of speech and tone of voice are really intangible, judging attack from ""criticism"" is highly subjective, so you;d be leaving that line up to human judgement.  While I don't disagree, it just doesn't seem feasible to enforce an all out ban on ""attack"" ads.","You have admitted in other comments that you don't know how to draw the line between an ""attack ad"" and legitimate criticism. Since you don't know how to draw that line, your proposed ban would be unenforceable. In addition, it would be illegal since the government has no business determining what people can and cannot say, short of explicit and serious incitement to criminal conduct.

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the legal aspect of banning attack ads and taxpayer funding of political campaigns, which may not directly address the original poster's concerns about the use of taxpayer money for attack ads.

predict-explain,"To say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental physiological differences between men and women that feminists appear to disregard. Now, in my opinion feminism seeks to advocate that anything that men can do, women can also but only when its convenient. To me it seems like feminists want to have their cake and eat it too. I will give a few examples that I always think about to illustrate my point.

1. The Ray Rice incident. What happened was unfortunate and of course he shouldn't have hit his wife. However, if this was Ray hanging out with another football player and knocked him out, this would not have been a story. Its because he punched a woman that this became a big deal. How can the feminist movement suggest ""Men should NEVER lay their hands on a woman"" but still say that men and women are equal. My answer is that its because men are generally stronger than women, but then that's my point. If you are going to advocate that they are equal then they should receive equal treatment. Again, CMV.

2. Rape cases. In college I have been required to watch numerous sexual harassment videos and attend mandatory training seminars on sexual assault. In these videos they always paint the male as a bad guy and its always targeted towards men. Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges. Why is this on the guy? People use the phrase ""Victim Blaming"" and say that its not on the girl regardless of the fact that she drunk. So what if she had gotten drunk and drove her car into a tree. Can she then say ""Maybe that wasn't a good idea"" and then get off the hook?

3. The draft. This one has also bothered me. According to the United States Selective Service Act, all men between ages 18-25 are required to register for the draft and may be picked for military service if the draft were to be implemented. Why are feminists all over the country not outraged about this? Shouldn't it be men AND women that are required to register for the draft? After all, men and women should be able to perform wartime duties equally right? It just seems like people pick and choose when its convenient for gender equality

Of course there are certain things that should be equal. Wages, education, etc. However I feel that a push for gender equality in every aspect of life is fundamentally wrong. CMV!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","It's always frustrating when people rail against feminists who say outrageous things without actually providing links to the offending speech, since it forces other feminists to apologize for what might be a misrepresentation of the thing they actually said. But here goes nothing:

1. A feminist might say that men shouldn't use violence against women because men are powerful enough to defend themselves against women without needing to resort to very much violence, or any violence at all. What they're trying to express might be the idea that since you're only justified in using as much force as is reasonable to prevent harm to yourself, and that men could in most cases prevent a woman from inflicting any sort of meaningful harm on them with a very minimal use of force, men shouldn't use very much force when protecting themselves from women. I think this is an overgeneralization; some men are really weak and some women are really strong, and that matters in evaluating when and how much force is justified. Some men are perfectly justified in using a lot of force against a woman to defend themselves. But the underlying principle, that men should be careful not to use too much force when defending themselves against women, is a good one, and I don't think it very charitable to declare all of contemporary feminism flawed because some, *not all*, feminists are making a hasty generalization.

2. This one is easy; a tree is not a moral agent with a duty to respect your autonomy, so getting drunk and crashing into a tree is entirely your fault. However, a person who wants to have sex with you *is* a moral agent with a duty to respect your autonomy, and if such a  person decides to fuck you while your capacity for rational decision making has been subverted by alcohol, they are raping you. So comparing a drunk driving accident to being raped while intoxicated is a disanalogy. Feminists see this bad comparison made *a lot*, so you're not alone in this error. It's like the [Wasson selection task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7NE7apn-PA) of feminist thought.

3. If you ask feminists about the draft, most will give you a two pronged answer; first, that women should be allowed to serve in the military in any capacity in which they are able, including combat, and second, that nobody should be forced to serve against their will. That's an implicit argument that the draft is unjust, so essentially you're asking why feminists aren't outraged that women aren't also subjected to this unjust treatment which men are subjected. If they're right that any sort of draft is unjust, and I think they are, then you're asking feminists to beat women down here rather than raise men up, which is a perverted sort of justice if you ask me. You might want to say that feminists should advocate for ending the draft, and that's fine. Problem is, feminist activists tend to be women, and women are perfectly justified in focusing on issues that affect them. They aren't obligated to focus their activism on men's issues. Feminists who are men are perfectly capable of addressing the draft issue, and should do just that. Heck, you could do that yourself, right now!

Alright, so to wrap this up; if you approach feminism in good faith and in a non-facile way, you're going to find that the project as a whole is not at all flawed or hypocritical. Unfortunately, it's pretty obvious your exposure to feminism has been via the bad faith arguments typical of the MRA/redpill/etc. movements. I highly recommend learning about feminism from sources that aren't explicitly hostile to it. Read bell hooks' [*Feminism is for Everybody*](http://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-bell-hooks/dp/0745317332), it's a really great intro to feminism, especially for people like you who have been exposed to it uncharitably.

e: Also, I'm only going to reply to OP.","1. It's wrong to hit anybody. Men *shouldn't* ever lay a hand on a woman nor should they lay their hand on a man. And when feminists are talking about equality they're not making the claim that women are as physically strong on average as men. They're talking about equal value as a human being in society, not physical prowess.

2. ""Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges."" Is this what really happens most often? Or, is it more often the case that the female is drunk, the man is not, and he takes advantage of the situation. Two drunk people having a one-night stand does not result in rape charges nearly as often as one sober and one drunk/unconscious person does. 

3. First of all, there are feminist groups such as SWAN (Service Women's Action Network) who push for female-inclusion in Selective Service. Second, the Draft is not a relevant issue today. Neither you nor anyone else is going to be drafted any time soon. Feminist groups--like any politically-active group--typically focus on *relevant* issues that actually affect people. So it's no wonder you don't see a lot of attention placed on it by feminist groups because at this point it doesn't really affect anyone one way or the other. Yes, men have to sign up for it, but it's only a relic of a system that is no longer used. If people were actively drafted and the majority of feminists supported the current system, you might have a point. But since the draft is not something that is likely to happen any time in the near future, you can't really blame feminists for wanting focus on more relevant issues.

It's difficult to address your problems with feminism because you haven't brought up any specific examples of mainstream feminists. You have no citations. There are also multiple schools of thought on feminism so I don't know if you're attacking intersectional feminism, third-wave feminism, both, neither, etc.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides well-thought-out explanations for each of the points raised by the original poster and offers a more nuanced perspective on feminist principles. The reply also encourages the original poster to approach feminism in good faith and suggests further reading to gain a better understanding of the movement. Reply A also addresses the issues raised in a respectful and informative manner, which could potentially lead the original poster to reconsider their views on feminism."
predict-explain,"Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. While fear of extermination would indeed be justified in 1930s Europe, fear of extermination by Islamic terrorists continues today even in Canada and the US. I've even heard that ISIS is going to exterminate the Jews, even though ISIS has not killed a single Jewish person to this date.

There is a widely-held view in Jewish circles that the UN is inherently anti-Semitic even though the majority of permanent members of the UN Security Council are very pro-Israel. UN troops never interfere with Israeli military operations and one of the first UN resolutions was the establishment of the State of Israel. Still, extremist groups like the JDL (Jewish Defence League) attract support from mainstream Jewish organizations, despite their classification as a terrorist group.

The Jewish community seems to think that their politicians at home persecute them as well. I know so many liberal Jews who will vote for a right-wing party just because they scream their unwavering support for Israel the loudest. Currently, every single major candidate running for President of the United States or Prime Minister of Canada has declared their staunch support for Israel; even left-wingers like Bernie Sanders and Canada's frontrunner Tom Mulcair.

Meanwhile, white cops are killing black kids at a horrifying rate but the Jewish community is still focused on their own supposed persecution. When the Charleston shooting broke out, my synagogue had one moment of silence then continued with its Israel fundraiser. My theory is that North American Jewish culture has developed an irrational persecution complex due to past persecution ritualistically retold every Hanukkah, Passover, Purim, Yom Ha'Shoah, etc. I realize this may come off as anti-Semetic and indeed my own family has called me a ""self-hating Jew"", although I think this only reinforces my point. Will someone change my view?","You've developed a theory based on your own family and community, and anecdotes from some national figures and events. But the question is, does the theory represent the majority of North American Jews.

In my experience it does not, and I also see plenty of national figures that support my position, such as for example [Chomky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky#Political_views), Jon Stewart, [Schulman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Schulman#Activism), etc.; Jews are very active in the BDS movement; and there is of course [J Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Street) and so forth.

Why is your experience different from mine? Well, you mentioned ""my synagogue."" It is very possible that your theory is right about more religious Jews, but a lot of Jews in the US are non-religious and never or almost never go to a synagogue. They are also much less supportive of Israel and far less likely to think Jews are persecuted.

You might be right that the Jewish **religion** focuses a lot on persecution of Jews (which makes sense, it's how Jews survived), but it simply is [not a big factor in the lives of many or most Jews in North America today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews#Observances_and_engagement): Even of Jews that consider themselves ""strongly connected"" to the Jewish religion, less than half belong to a synagogue. And more and more Jews just don't care about religion, considering themselves only ""culturally Jewish"", 20% in 1990 to 37% in 2008, and by now that number is even higher.","You have to remember that many Jews alive today were actively persecuted and discriminated against in North America. By chance I just just finished reading an article about Jon Stewart where he describes being bullied for his religion as a child. Clubs still excluded Jewish members and Jews were still treated as very much separate from the rest of society. People who grew up in the 50s, 60s and 70s still faced a fair amount of discrimination as children and younger adults and it's not unreasonable to be affected by that. That makes feelings of persecution entirely rational.",A,A,"I would say Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a well-reasoned argument with examples of national figures and movements that contradict the original poster's theory. It also brings up the diversity within the Jewish community in North America, highlighting that not all Jews share the same views or experiences. Additionally, Reply A addresses the role of religion in shaping perceptions of persecution and offers statistics to support their points. Overall, Reply A presents a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective, which may challenge the original poster's beliefs and potentially lead them to reconsider their views."
predict-explain,"I have come to this conclusion for several reasons.
*The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience alone it is the country most likely to use them again.

*The main positive effect of atomic weapons, that gets brought up a lot , is mutually assured destruction. The USA dropped 2 atomic bombs, not as retribution to an atomic attack. It demonstrated a lower bar for considering using them.

*The USA regularly starts new wars. It's certainly the nation among the big superpowers that is most likely to initiate a new war and, in the case of Irak, can not even explain why they went to war in the first place. A country that is this likely to be involved in wars is more likely to find itself in a position where it would consider using another atomic bomb.

It demonstrated a lower bar for considering using them.

It was to prevent a much, much greater loss of life had the mainland of Japan been invaded.  Estimates put it as high as 1 million casualties just on the US side.  It's conceivable that the Japanese would have lost 2-3 times as many.

For comparison, 246,000 were killed as a high-end estimate in the two bombings.

&gt;A country that is this likely to be involved in wars is more likely to find itself in a position where it would consider using another atomic bomb.

I think you have a basic misunderstanding of what nuclear weapons are used for.  At this point, since multiple nations have them, it's basically a fall back option when facing an existential conflict.  Their use in anything less than full-scale world war is basically impossible.

No other country has as much to lose as the US when it comes to stuff like that.  Our entire country depends on trade and relatively good relations with the rest of the goods-producing world.  Using nuclear weapons outside of that context would certainly be the end of the US.

&gt;as the example of Irak has shown, can often not even explain why they went to war in the first place.

Can you name another war we started where we don't know exactly why we went to war?","What about a country like Syria or Iraq that used weapons of mass destruction **against its own citizens**?  The US used primitive nuclear weapons to end a war with fewer casualties on both sides after dropping millions of leaflets alerting the area of their intentions.  The US has been involved in several wars since then without using nukes.  

The US has a large military and stable government, and has the legitimacy as a state to secure its nuclear weapons.  I think a semi-failed state like Sudan, Nigeria, Tunisia, Uganda, etc would be much more dangerous to possess nuclear weapons because they much more easily could fall into the hands of terrorists.  

Finally, the US faces no immediate threat, and is unlikely to have to threaten to use Nuclear weapons in the face of an immediate and existential invasion.  I think it is more dangerous for a country like Israel to possess nuclear weapons because they much more easily could be put in a point where they think they need to use them to defend against a conventional attack or face their destruction",B,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a counterargument to the original poster's claim that the USA is more likely to use atomic weapons again, by explaining the context in which the atomic bombs were used in Japan and the deterrent effect of nuclear weapons in modern times. The user also addresses the misconception that the USA is likely to use nuclear weapons in non-existential conflicts. Additionally, the user challenges the original poster's statement about the USA not being able to explain why they went to war in Iraq.

predict-explain,"Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate ""News"" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbait/native advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand ""BuzzFeed News"" as separate from the rest of BuzzFeed, it's alright. Still not going to use it for my news (or anything really) but definitely see it in a new light. Thanks for the perspective and interesting discussion guys!

Buzzfeed is a terrible news organization. They are basically the death of journalism. They focus on vague clickbait headlines for the sole purpose of gather views ultimately to make the most ad money possible. I feel this is clearly a sign of a lack of journalistic integrity. Headlines are meant to inform, not confuse. ""Obama said something AMAZING at the state of the union, and you won't believe the reaction!"" What is that?! That's not informing me, bringing me valuable information. It's vague, biased, uninformative, and purely designed just to get a click. Buzzfeed also focuses on native advertisement and meaningless lists which makes it dangerous for the uniformed who cannot discern between what is news and what isn't and ultimately lose a valuable skill in determining what is a good source and what is not. They also plagiarize, which immediately makes an institution lose all credibility.

I've had this view for a while and mostly kept to myself about it, but last night someone brought the topic up and to my surprise a journalism student actually started to praise/defend BuzzFeed. So I figured I would post the big counter points she made and why they aren't legitimate.

1. **BuzzFeed has a large base** ""BuzzFeed has revolutionized how news organizations attract viewership and the mass consumption of BuzzFeed show it's prowess in journalism. Journalism is about consumption""

This is a silly point. Just because a lot of people read BuzzFeed does not mean it is a legitimate news organization. Sure, it's impressive BuzzFeed can attract so many people to their site through social media and clickbait, but so what? The New York Times could slap a big naked lady on their front page and I'm sure it would increase viewership, but I think we can all agree that doesn't make it better news. And I don't believe journalism is about consumption/getting the most consumption. If the goal is to just get people to read/buy their articles, there is no incentive to generate good news. Everything will just be tabloids.

2. **Every news organization is copying BuzzFeed** ""The Washington Post, CNN, Fox News are all scrambling to adopt BuzzFeed's revolutionary model. They can't keep up with BuzzFeed's dominance. They're copying BuzzFeed because it's so good!""

Yea, can't argue there. All these news organizations are copying BuzzFeed. And that hurts journalism. Now all sources are turning to clickbait baloney. BuzzFeed is killing the market because they don't have integrity and are willing to make meaningless posts that are designed to go viral. So now in order to compete, all other news organizations must do the same, which hurts journalism. It is now quite hard to find an unbiased, un-editorialized news source.

3.**They do really good pieces** ""I'll admit 90% of BuzzFeed is stupid, meaningless posts, but they actually do really good pieces. They've started a whole field of 'explanatory news' and really tries to educate a reader. Most news organizations just assume you know all the background of a piece, but most don't. So these pieces really help the public understand current event.""

That's great! They should focus on that then! Just because there are good pieces dotted around the site, doesn't mean it's a good news source. If I see a guy down a steak I'm not going to eat his poop just because there might be some prime rib in there. The New York Times does similar things, where they'll have a 30 page story on something like an avalanche explaining the mountain, back country skiing, the days leading up to it, the backstory to all involved. It's great stuff and they don't have ""17 Pizza's that look like Ohio"" as the next article cued up. I think it's also bad because it gives BuzzFeed credibility. So they can point to the handful of articles and say they're real news when people call them out for their mass quantities of meaningless malarky.

4.**They get people to read the news** ""Sure, there's a lot of crap, but it gets people reading the news, which traditional media doesn't do. The clickbait gets people reading! You realize it's crap because you're an educated person who goes to a private college, but most people don't. So it doesn't really matter because those people now read the news where they wouldn't have before.""

It's true. People who didn't read the news do now thanks to BuzzFeed. But shouldn't we focus on giving those people an education, teach them to evaluate news sources, give them the tools to discern bias and editorialization? Why are we bringing news down to the lowest common denominator just so more people read it? If we ruin journalism in the process, does it really matter if more people have access to it? Also, I think it's really dangerous to do so because now those who previously didn't read the news have BuzzFeed as their introduction to news/journalism. Those people who aren't educated or didn't read the news now are much more susceptible to native advertisement. So now there's possibly a whole host of people who think ""This diet pill made these 12 fitness instructors resign because they couldn't compete!"" is real news and not just advertisement for a useless sugar pill.

5.**It's a new platform, the next evolution** ""You just don't understand this new platform. It's like how print journalism first went on the web. People said the same things you're saying back then but it turned out fine. You just need to realize it's a new age for journalism and you must adapt.""

Print journalism going on the web was just that. Putting the news on the web. It wasn't changing the what people receive or altering news or putting in ads that look like news. It was just giving a new out for people to access news from. I know social media is big and is a powerful tool, but you can use it without making this clickbait nothings. Tweet out the headline with a link, have a 'share on facebook' button on the article, post it to reddit. Use the tools to increase access to information, not to destroy it. I'm sure one day well all have personal holograms and that will be a new platform for news. But a hologram of ""3 of the cutest puppies that show black lives matter"" still isn't news. 

That's the major points I head in defense of BuzzFeed. There were a few more but all under those general points and nothing that CMV. I think the real dangerous part of all this is that all those points I just listed are being taught in journalism classes at renowned institutions. BuzzFeed is now the accepted and taught method for delivering the news. I fear this could be the death of journalism. I always thought ""BuzzFeed is kinda dumb, but hey, if people like looking at silly lists, who am I to say they can't."" But now these silly lists are being hailed as the height of contemporary journalism! It seems were doomed to editorialized, plagiarized, uninformative clickbait for our news from now on.

Anyway, just looking for someone to change my view. I actually would like it if someone changed my view because it would be great to go look at silly lists all day. Seems like a good way to kill time but I don't want to support BuzzFeed. So hopefully someone changes my view, but we'll see.

* Sensationalist views about the end of journalism have always existed.

* Misquoting (deliberate or idiotic) from untrustworthy sources by major news organizations have always existed.


What you're seeing is not the end of journalism and BuzzFeed is just someone riding the wave of a trend. People are more interested in hearing someone validate their ideas than they are in aligning their ideas with reality.  This changes with the generations as phases do and it will pass.","I understand where you're coming from, /u/iwasbeingfacetious.  I absolutely hate all the ""Which Frozen character are you?"" things.  And they pop up all the time.  But here are a few points:

First, /u/phcullen is right--it is their way to make money.  If the 9 shitty clickbait quizzes may for the 1 interesting, well-written article, then the whole thing makes sense.  Now maybe the ratio is off.  Maybe there should be 5 articles per 5 quizzes.  But now we're just talking about degrees.

Second, (and this point pre-supposes that you're okay with the first one) even though I get mad at Buzzfeed for their bullshit (my least favorite: taking an /r/askreddit post and making it an article.  THEY DIDN'T WRITE SHIT).  The thing that would make it an improper news site is if the clickbait was effecting the journalism.  So, look at Buzzfeed *not* as the online equivalent of a newspaper, but the online equivalent as a news channel.  Clickbait = the morning show where Kathy and Hoda or whoever get drunk talking about nothing by 11am.  That doesn't effect the 6pm News.

Edit: formatting issues",B,B,"I believe Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B acknowledges the frustration with BuzzFeed's clickbait content but also presents a perspective on how it can be justified as a means to support more substantial journalism. By comparing BuzzFeed to a news channel with different segments, it helps to separate the clickbait content from the more serious journalism. Additionally, the point about the clickbait not affecting the journalism itself addresses one of the original poster's concerns about journalistic integrity. Overall, Reply B provides a more balanced view and offers a potential way for the original poster to reconsider their stance on BuzzFeed."
predict-explain,"This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in.  I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained.  

My wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country.  I will reflect on my mother’s story.  She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country.  When she came to this country she was on government assistance.  With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master’s Degree.  Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community.  I don’t need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent’s generation, their hard work and sacrifice.  

I hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country.  I’ve read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings.  However I don’t completely buy into it.  I’ve seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education.  As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I’ll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do.   At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint.  As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings.  They had no problems acting 'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america.  That is why I don’t have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty.  I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story.  If there are books or articles which provides a cogent counter argument please feel free to share.    

TL:DR – The rationale for why blacks and Hispanics are unsuccessful in the U.S. are bunk because of the success of Asian Immigrants.  

Edit: This is not to say that there isn't racism in society, especially towards Asians.  Colleges definitely try to make it harder for Asians to get admitted despite higher scores, and there is a Bamboo Ceiling in the workplace.  However, I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.  

Edit2: I appreciate the dialogue.  One point which I'll concede and am swayed from the dialogue is that racism, more specifically the historic racism perpetrated in the U.S. such as Jim Crow and Slavery created the culture which is present in the poor black community, hindering them from rising from poverty.  But nothing disputes that this culture is reason, and not the present-day racism that is preventing them from achieving in this country.  That is what I have issue against that the media portrays a image of victimization due to current day racism, however, I don't think the type of racism is the cause, maybe past racism, but not the type minorities face today.  If no one has a counter argument against the cultural aspect, shouldn't black culture, the one that glamorizes the baller lifestyle, be the focused of policy makers to change rather than focusing their efforts on social restructuring to accomodate the culture?  

Edit3: At the end of the day, and the dialogue set forth I come away from it with the following:

1) That current poor black culture  is a result of systemic discrimination.  
2) No one has disputed that culture which I have generally claimed is the REASON for the state of poor black americans.  
3) The present day racism and white privilege that exists today is not sufficient enough to either hold a demographic down or lift them up, not as much as the modern day media seem to claim.   
4) I want to beef up on some books and articles cited
5) The IQ debate. hmmm I'm just not going to touch that right now.","Your knowledge of the systematic racism in this country is elementary at best. Maybe after a few more years living here and understanding the nuance you will have a better grasp of it. 


And since you asked for books. Start with James Baldwin and when you're done with his work, specifically The Fire Next Time,  I would recommend Ta-Nehisi Coates newest book.","I think the blacks rights thing plays a big issue in this. It really hasn't been that long since that period and the racism from that still persist for a period of time after changes in laws.  In part the effects of that and the slavery thing is still ingrained in their culture. 

For the Latino population, many are illegal immigrants, which really affects their earning potential. Then their families also tend to be bigger too which means more money needed to support. Teen pregnancy rates were also higher for them which hinders them too. 

Asians are lucky with not as strong discrimination and oppression.  I know there is racism, but it's not nearly the same as the other two population. It helps us get ahead as we are seen as ""smarter"" or ""hardworking"".",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This reply provides specific book recommendations that delve into the issues of systemic racism and discrimination in the United States, offering a more nuanced perspective for the original poster to consider. Additionally, the tone of the reply is more respectful and informative, which may make the original poster more receptive to the information being shared. Reply B, while providing some reasons for the disparities faced by black and Latino populations, does not offer any specific resources or in-depth analysis for the original poster to explore further."
predict-explain,"**GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE.**

Reasons being:

1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a job or any personal income to speak of. I don't have the financial independence to live by this creed.

2. It sounds like not much fun

One of those reasons is pretty valid and one definitely isn't.

I believe this because it just makes the most logical sense to me. Why on earth would it be fair for me to walk around with a new pair of shoes when there's people I can see *in my own damn neighborhood* who can't afford a square meal, to speak nothing of comfortable clothing? It's just...wrong.

That's why I think that as soon as somebody has their basic needs and some *reasonable, modest* comforts like a TV, and air conditioning, any more money past that should go to a charity, or similarly be used for good.

**I'm really, really not trying to be high and mighty about this**. I don't live like this, and honestly even when I move out and start making my own money I don't think I'd be able to bring myself to throw out the PC and the cellphone and the car. I also don't think there's any non-arbitrary specific point where it could be declared that someone is being selfish with their money, and also everybody's definition of ""basic needs and modest comforts"" is probably different. I think you still get my meaning.

I still believe, speaking in idealistic terms, it's unjustifiable to keep to yourself what would be best spent saving others.

**EDIT:** My V has been C'd! /u/Lesser_Frigate_Bird made a good comment please read it. Keep the responses coming if you want though!

**EDIT2:** A couple of challenges have been along the lines of, ""where do you draw the line on what's a basic need and what's frivolous spending?"" to which I'd have to respond, ""I don't know but I think you catch my drift"". Obviously if we were going to codify this belief into law there would need to be a strict number or strict criteria but on an individual basis, even though it'd be different from person to person, I think everybody knows roughly what's a reasonable need or desire and what's too much.

With that being said, you could still get a job (depending on the labor laws where you live) and donate any extra money you make. You could also donate your time to charities in your area which is often just as valuable, if not more valuable than your money. So, do you do this? If not, why not?

As for your second point, you're right; donating everything after one's own living expenses wouldn't be fun. While this may be true, if everyone was pressured into giving up everything that they don't need, I don't think many people would bother working very hard to be able to have a lot of money and nice things. Personally, I would quit my job and take an easy minimum wage job that I would constantly slack off at. Right now I'd consider my lifestyle to be more than comfortable (although I'm certainly not rich). Why should I, or anyone else for that matter, bother to keep working at the level I do when at the end of the day I'll have the same lifestyle as everyone else? And, what do you think the effect would be in society as a whole if the majority of people lived like you proposed and decided to stop working like I've proposed? I know that sounds selfish, and maybe it is, but society thrives on people being selfish and working to have more than just a modest lifestyle.","Person X works extremely hard, earns lots of money, and keeps it all for himself.  Person Y has an easy job and earns just enough money to cover his own expenses.  

If X is morally obligated to give away his excess money, then should Y also be morally obligated to work harder, so that he can earn more money, so that he can give away more money as well?

If X is morally obligated to give away all his excess money, and Y is not morally obligated to *earn* more money (so that he can likewise give it away), then X is a fool for working so hard.  All his hard work gains him nothing.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A addresses the practicality and implications of the original poster's belief, highlighting the potential consequences of everyone adopting such a lifestyle. It also offers alternative ways to contribute to charity, such as donating time or extra money earned from a job. This challenges the original poster to consider the broader impact of their belief and provides a more nuanced perspective on charitable giving.

Reply B, on the other hand, focuses more on the individual's personal choices and the potential consequences of their actions. While it raises valid points about the fairness of expecting some individuals to work harder than others, it doesn't directly address the original poster's belief in the same way that Reply A does. It also leans more towards a philosophical argument rather than a practical one.

Overall, Reply A provides a more comprehensive and thought-provoking response that is likely to encourage the original poster to reconsider their views."
predict-explain,"I heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying this was shameful, and embarrassing to the US military, a ridiculous simplification. To be clear, I am no fan of Huckabee, and I have nothing against our military or militaries in general. That said, I think he was dead on.

I think most people who don't accept this do so because they think it's crass, and brutal. Well, yeah, but it's also absolutely true. That's why the military has all those rifles and artillery and tanks and battleships and bombs and chemical weapons and knives and humvees and machine guns: for the killing of people and the breaking of things. Sure, not every member of the military's job is to be a killer, but those people are there to support the killers. The cooks, mechanics, engineers, and secretaries are all there to let everyone else kill people and break things as safely and efficiently as possible.

Again, I have absolutely no problem with this from a moral perspective. I am certainly not condemning anybody, just stating facts. Most people I've seen disagree with Huckabee are just dancing around this. ""Soldiers exist to protect the United States and her interests!"" Sure, using violence or the threat of violence. ""The army doesn't just kill people, they developed the Internet!"" Yeah, as a weapon to coordinate their violence in the most efficient way possible. The internet we have now is just an unintended side effect.

The US military is in a bit of a unique position, since they haven't had a lot of opportunities to do their job recently. Our military is so badass, there are not a lot of people with enough courage or stupidity to take us on. Thus, a lot of time is spent running practice drills and handing out food to people after earthquakes. That's great, but it's all a displacement activity until they need to do their real job. It's a sideshow, a distraction. The alternative would be these men sitting around, waiting for something to need destroying. We don't keep our military around and spend billions of dollars for disaster relief. We keep them around to kill people and break things. That's their real purpose, simple as that.

The (legitimate*) purpose of the military is and has always been to defend the public from foreign threats. Now, you're right that the most normal way to do that is to kill people and break things. Killing the damned Nazi that tried to take my house or breaking the tank he's driving is a perfectly reasonable way to protect people from a big foreign threat that manifests in a simple way, often in a uniform or within defined borders.
But those sorts of threats aren't very common any more, are they? Modern threats are a good deal less complicated.

Take Vietnam^. The military tried their standard kill-people-break-stuff routine. In fact, they did it way better than they've ever done it before. How'd that go? Did it mitigate the supposed threat from the NVA? Nup.

And most modern tasks for the defence force are like that. Aside from China, which is deterred by MAD, all of America's threats, from Al Qaeda to African civil war, are unconventional. That means the US military needs to adopt a more sophisticated approach than Mike Huckabee is capable of understanding with his pea brain. This might be something like counter-insurgency, perhaps. These would involve much more than mere violence. EG, in Afghanistan the strategy is clear and build - political science is just as important as violence!

This is why people make fun of Mike Huckabee: he's too stupid or dishonest to be capable of understanding complex things like basic strategy.

*The military can also be used for a bunch of other things, like invading and toppling democracies as a welfare handout to American big business.

^Whether or not Vietnam was a real threat is immaterial. That's a decision for the politicians.","This is becoming increasingly one part of many facets of the military.  Today, we spend an extraordinary amount of time trying to combat terrorism in its many forms across the world.  Sure, if you're engaging in counterinsurgency strategy, killing people and breaking things so your desired faction gets an advantage is one method you can employ. It's a quick surge (no, not necessarily *that* surge) of military power to tip the scales, giving your preferred ""team"" the advantage.

If you're adopting or transitioning to a counterterrorism strategy, however, this will often involve outreach to the local population and its leaders; providing security; offering resources such as food and clothing, and; generally trying to create conditions that will lower the fear factor of local populations caving to terrorists and heighten the personal investment in building up local communities.

We found this out the hard way during the early stages of Iraq, obliterating the enemy but also obliterating civilians and their homes as well.  Even ignoring humanitarian outcries, this makes it far easier for terrorists to make physical incursions since local populations are vulnerable and scared, and thus more likely to acquiesce to their demands.  It makes it easier for ""emotional"" incursions, because you have a whole generation sympathetic to parties who are going to kill the people and break the things that killed their families and broke their things.

In contrast, we saw way more gains when our military began taking up a police function.  It still had traditional military characteristics, including the realistic ability and legal authority to kill and break things when necessary, but it also adopted a more security/rebuilding role, trying to keep streets safe for people and commerce while providing training, building and resources.

If I wanted to explore the issue further, I'd go so far as to say the best anti-terrorism strategy is going to strongly resemble a nation-building strategy.  It takes time and dedication that most leaders of democratic nations won't be able to muster for the long haul, but that's neither here nor there.  The fact remains that modern military hurdles have expanded beyond showing up on a physical field of battle and trying to outgun the other guys -- which, if we're being honest, is a *vast* oversimplification of historical warfare, and is yet another reason to be skeptical of Huckabee's military acumen.  It's choice phrasing designed to be blunt and appeal to folks who view the military as a cosmetic addition to America's display of strength.  It's not an accurate framing of any military's role, particularly not one like ours that is contributing to such a wide spectrum of international causes, even if we're ultimately there in some form for our (proactive) defense.",B,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B provides a more nuanced and detailed explanation of the role of the military in modern times, highlighting the shift towards counterterrorism and nation-building strategies. Reply B also acknowledges the importance of factors beyond just killing and breaking things, such as outreach to local populations, security, and rebuilding efforts. This comprehensive explanation challenges the original poster's simplistic view of the military's purpose and provides a more complex understanding of the military's role in today's world."
predict-explain,"There's been so much uproar over Sweden and the Netherlands and other countries that have been dealing with immigration issues. I would like to move to another country in the future so I understand wanting to move to a country in Europe, although I am not seeking asylum from a war torn homeland. At any rate, these countries have a history of an ethnic population and when one thinks of Sweden, there's a certain image just as when one thinks of what and who constitutes any specific country. I would hate to have Sweden be overrun by rampant immigration from any country (my problem is not with the Muslim population specifically/Middle eastern immigration but the idea of rampant immigration in general) just as I would hate for any other country, let's say Bangladesh, to be overrun with let's say, British immigration.

European countries are drawn roughly along cultural, ethnic, and linguistic lines, but they aren't always perfect. Some parts of Italy speak French and German, some parts of Finland are mostly Swedish, etc. Some countries are drawn so that ethnic groups appear between countries (Rwanda/Burundi, or Bavarians between Germany/Austria/Czech Republic), and some countries have multiple ethnicities and cultures within their borders (Belgium, Switzerland, and Canada are all great examples).

The problem with ""preserving the culture/country"" from immigration is that it's difficult to really define the native population in many countries, especially countries that have changed hands of power hundreds of times over the millennial. Why should Sweden be spared immigration when they annexed and immigrated into Lappland? Why should Great Britain be spared from immigrations when they immigrated all over the world during colonization, and currently occupy part of Ireland? What even is the ""native population of Great Britain""?

A majority of countries will have a very poor claim to being solely or majorly inhabited by the verifiably only native population of that country. I think the only two countries that would have a solid claim to that are North and South Korea. Even then, I think it's a bad argument that blocking immigration into your super homogenously ethnic country helps ""preserve the nation"". From what? From people that are a bit different? Many countries stand as examples that modern countries can work effectively with ethnic heterogeneity, particularly Canada and Brazil. Both are countries with a lot of diversity, big immigrant populations, and people just *don't care* about race, particularly in urban centres. If a country can not be racist, it can use immigration to its advantage.","&gt;when one thinks of Sweden, there's a certain image just as when one thinks of what and who constitutes any specific country

Why should there be? It's just an arbitrary *thing* we created. You probably couldn't tell the average Swedish person from the average French person if you didn't hear them speak. They're both white-- and after that, where is the science? Perhaps the *average* French person is shorter, yet that doesn't speak to any differences. The concept of ethnicity isn't very defined. Is a French person whose ancestors came from Sweden 500 years ago not French? Likewise, why restrict immigration to a country because a person within that country is not ""ethnically"" like the others? This is quite the backwards concept-- where someone is born should not determine where they wish to live. If I can afford to migrate to another country, and I can afford to buy land, and I'm willing to take a job, I should have every right to do so. ""Ethnic purity"" is a myth used to propagate hate",B,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a more nuanced and historical perspective on the concept of native populations and the idea of preserving a nation's culture. It points out the complexities of defining a homogenous native population in many countries and challenges the notion that blocking immigration is necessary for preserving a nation. The example of countries like Canada and Brazil successfully managing ethnic heterogeneity demonstrates that diversity can be a strength rather than a threat to a nation's identity.

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on questioning the arbitrary nature of ethnicity and emphasizes the right of individuals to migrate and live where they choose. While these points are valid, reply A delves deeper into the historical context and challenges the original poster's concerns about preserving a nation's culture through immigration restrictions."
predict-explain,"I have a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names. This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into taking her's husband's last name, and gay spouses also have a conundrum of their own. 

However, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. One small example is if you work in an industry where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind (like I do). It's helpful to know in advance who is related to who by just looking at a piece of paper.

BUT, if the wife and the husband choose not to share a last name, please God settle on one name for your kid. Just flip a coin for which last name your kid takes if that's what you need to do. Don't make everyone around him have to deal with saying and writing out Reginald Henry Lieberman-Montgomery. 

A metaphor I would make for this would be gender pronouns. You have the right to tell me whether you identify as a man or a woman, but I swear to God if you insist that everyone around you refer to you strictly with the gender neutral pronouns Ni, Nem and Nir, I will be having none of it. 

As a counterpoint, I will say that I can't ever imagine myself taking my wife's last name. And if she chose not to take mine, I think I would feel a little disappointed. Further, I can't imagine feeling comfortable with my kid not taking my last name. So I already recognize a bit of the hypocrisy. In that way, I see that I am posing a problem without an apparent solution. On top of your rebuttals, I would also be curious to hear alternative ideas/social structures that could work to level the playing field, AND prevent me from having to say a mouthful. 

**EDIT:**

Apologies for the day long delay-- car emergency took all night and all morning.

Thanks for all your responses! Here are some of my views you've changed. 

Spain &gt; 'Murica. There's a clear system in place in Spanish countries that actually speaks to my ""one family name"" point. People consistently take the fathers, then mother's surname. Then the kid's kids will do the same. Gives you family history and also something to put on your mailbox. 

What I personally like about this is that it's uniform. If two last names were adopted country-wide in America, I would have much less of a problem with it. 

I also want to clarify: My problem with the ""mouthful"" of hyphenated last names does not mean that I would also suggest gentrifying the Krzyzewskis and the Chevaprevadumrongs of the world. To shorten your family name is to bastardize it. No ill feelings to those with shortened last names of course-- my last name was actually gentrified two generations ago. 

Finally, here is a post that very well summarizes my American sentiments: 

&gt; While this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to “People who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. People who name their kids something I dislike or don’t understand are selfish and stupid.” You have not said this, but I think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated.

&gt; You want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. If a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate.

My American sensibilities that shorter is better are deeply ingrained and will probably be there 'til I die. That said, at least I can recognize them so that I know to keep them in check. 

While I will continue to make fun of people who have two last names, it will be with the same conviction that I make fun of everyone else. No hostility here.

Thanks guys!","&gt; However, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. One small example is if you work in an industry where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind (like I do). It's helpful to know in advance who is related to who by just looking at a piece of paper.

What about step-families with mis-matched names? 

Or non-married families where the mother and child have a different last name?

Should we expect a child living with his/her mother to change his/her last name because their mother remarried and changed her last name?

&gt; where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind 

How many people work in industries where they meet people blind and need to know if they're related? My mom kept her last name and it has never been a problem in 30 years.

&gt; However, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. 

What about people with very confusing names? I'd say the name Smith-Jones is much easier to say than something Krzyzewski. Does someone with a confusing last name owe it to us to choose a more traditional last name?","I think it's useful to be able to identify a family on the basis of last names, and so I think it's useful for everyone to share the same label.

And this is exactly why hyphenation is such a useful thing. If you meet a group of people who share the last name ""Montegue-Capulet"" then you immediately understand that they are a family unit, and you also understand something about the ancestry from both sides of the family. Additionally, hyphenation also scores points for upholding some form of gender equality.

Of course, it's impractical to expect people's names to grow exponentially in size with every generation - but this doesn't have to be a problem- it's easy to resolve: when someone gets married, the son keeps only the father's name and the daughters keep only the mother's - and then they hyphenate with their spouse. We can also adopt the convention that the man's name always comes first in the hyphenation - even better - now we know both their family ties and ancestry (I don't care about how it's ordered, we just need to decide).

In summary, it only takes three names (one first, two last) to identify a person, their family unit, their family ties, and their ancestry in a complete and fair way.  Saying two last names does take longer than one, but last names are only really used for official purposes, and under formal situations. And - people are already hyphenating. I figure we may as well adopt that system as efficiently and informatively as possible.",B,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a well-thought-out argument in favor of hyphenated last names, highlighting the benefits of identifying family units and ancestry through last names. The suggestion of a specific naming convention for future generations also adds a practical solution to the issue of growing last names. Additionally, Reply B addresses the concerns raised by the original poster in a logical and structured manner. Overall, Reply B presents a more comprehensive and detailed argument in support of hyphenated last names."
predict-explain,"The universe exists, and came in to being somehow. 

Some claim that we don't know yet exactly how the universe came in to being, we know roughly when it did, and roughly *how* it did, but what caused it to come in to being is a unanswered question - one we may never answer.

There are others that believe God brought the Universe in to being (that is, an all powerful entity was the first-mover, setting the universe in motion). 

But if God is all powerful and infinite, we have no idea what His/Her/its nature is, and couldn't possibly know, as mortal, finite beings. What is the difference between saying we don't know how the universe came in to being, and saying that this entity that we don't know the nature of, and couldn't possibly comprehend, brought the universe in to being? Aren't they equally nebulous beliefs?

How does believing that God brought the universe in to being differentiate your beliefs from those who would say we don't know how the universe was brought in to being? Aren't they pretty much the same belief?

predict-explain,"I just read this [article](http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-adv-asian-race-tutoring-20150222-story.html#page=1) stating that blacks and hispanics have an easier time getting into certain colleges than asians and whites. This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering that only certain minorities have an easier time getting in, while others like asians have a much harder time. It should be based on your grade average and the score you get on your SAT (I'm from Canada so I'm not really sure how SAT score factors into that. I'm used to only your high school grades being counted). If an asian student gets a 90% average, his/her application shouldn't be tossed aside for a black student who only managed to get an 83% average. Maybe in the past affirmative action was necessary, due to racial bias. Nowadays it's completely useless and does nothing but inhibit asians and whites.

I believe your race shouldn't matter when it comes to these things. It's like saying blacks and hispanics are more stupid than asians and whites and therefore should get some help to get into college. Also, before you say that it has to do with economic status, I would like to disagree. My family (including cousins and whatnot) came from very poor circumstances. However, most of my cousins have gone on to get degrees in things like engineering.

This just isn't true. Some parents don't stress education as much. Some parents don't provide a good structure that allows their kids to value education and learn. Some parents can't be there to help their kid with math homework.

A 9 year old can't be expected to be mature enough to understand how important an education is. That kid basically does what his/her parents tell them. And if education isn't valued or if the parents are absent, it makes it much more difficult for that child to succeed (not impossible, of course, but much more difficult.)

&gt; Maybe in the past affirmative action was necessary, due to racial bias. Nowadays it's completely useless and does nothing but inhibit asians and whites.

So you're saying that racial bias no longer exists in modern society? Standardized tests favor rich, white and asian people. They are often better predictors of a student's race and wealth than their future success. So, in fact, the SAT is still a very biased test.",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides a more nuanced understanding of the systemic disadvantages faced by non-white individuals, and explains how policies like affirmative action are meant to address these disparities. Reply A also challenges the original poster to consider the broader societal context and historical legacy of racism, which may prompt them to reevaluate their perspective on race-based admissions policies. Reply B, while valid in pointing out the role of parental influence and structural barriers in education, does not directly address the issue of systemic racism and the need for policies like affirmative action."
predict-explain,"EDIT: Title should read: Triggers, in the way they are currently being (mis)used to represent things that cause discomfort or sadness in people, are not a real thing. People who cry 'triggered' because something reminds them of a NON EXTREME incident or issue they are struggling with should not be sheltered or given the attention they are seeking. 

EDIT 2: For some reason I feel that not everybody finished reading my post although theres a tl;dr and a very clear message that my views dont apply to extreme cases like in people who have PTSD yet Im getting all these (actually heartwrenching and very valid arguments) about people with PTSD whom my beef isnt with.

EDIT 3: All in all I think my anger towards modern day 'trigger happu tumblrinas' has somewhat subsided and Im beginning to understand that we cant scruitinise how everybody feels and that some people are stronger than others like one user said and that the effects of triggers on some people can be deadly. 

Thank you all! :)

In 7th and 8th grade I was a snob. This was probably because I am the youngest of five siblings and was fairly better looking than my classmates (before the acne, bad eyesight and crooked teeth kicked in) among other things. 


I realised this because of the way my classmates talked about me and treated me and I took the summer of 8th grade to transform into somebody else. I do not recall how exactly I did it but I did. Everybody was surprised, myself included, that the transformation was permanent and genuine.

Sadly, I was no longer a bitch but a pushover instead. I was bullied shortly after and had a horrible 8 or so years until I graduated from university. During those 8 or so years, my first love died in a car crash, my parents had a terrible accident leaving my mother unable to walk for a year, of course I picked up smoking, I started to serial-date guys and their treatment to me kept getting progressively worse all while I tried to do well at university because it was getting too expensive for my parents to pay for and getting a job wasn't enough for me to sustain myself.

Add to the above a religious struggle between myself, my society and my own mother who didn't talk to me for three months while I lived in the same house as her because of my religious and romantic choices (I was dating a black guy), and you get a fairly broken person.

I didn't trust anyone, I was naive, nervous, insecure, a people pleaser, somewhat promiscuous and a smoker. I did things I never thought I'd do and was put in situations I never wanted to be placed in.


I was even ashamed of my own psychologist whom I never went back to visit after a couple of sessions because of how fucked up I was.

My issues seem trivial but these are just the things that I haven't blocked out. My view does apply to individuals who have gone through everything but EXTREME trauma. 

My POINT is: How can I, and so many people who have gone through worse, emerge as functional if not even better people than we were because of what we went through by using our own logic and reasoning, the help of others, counselling and other resources, while others simply act as if life is supposed to be somehow tailored for them and that whatever 'triggers' them by making them actually have to THINK about what they went through should somehow be erased from their lives?


Tl;dr: Shit happens in life and people should wade through the pile of crap and come out as functional human beings via their own logic rather than project their issues unto others and claim that whatever 'triggers' them to think about their problems must somehow be banished or banned.

Triggers are real, but VERY rare, it usually happens after a rape, a war or after a childhood abuse. Trigger warnings don't really harm anyone, they are just a courtesy, we have them for everything. Movies (R, PG-13, PG, G, NC-17. And it always says why) video games (M, T, E10, E, EC, AO, and it always says why) TV (TVMA, TV14, TVPG, Y7, Y, G) and it always says why. 

They are a courtesy, obviously they should be there so people don't accidentally take their kids to see a dirty movie. When it comes to trauma triggers, most therapists help people either get adjusted or identify triggers, but an extra warning never hurts.

**Edit: ""Stronger"" was a bad choice of words, some people are less effected.**","I have PTSD from severe childhood trauma. 

There are half a hundred things that will get my heart racing and send me into spiralling anxiety, if not outright terror, which are reasonably commonplace. But I don't say to people ""you slamming doors triggers me"". In fact, I don't tell people what tirggers me at all unless they are very close to me or it's necessary because *that's ammunition to use against me* if you want to psychologically terrorize me. I'm not saying that many people would, but it would only take one or two people to make me fall to pieces if they knew about my vulnerability and started using them against me systematically.

What does this have to do with trigger warnings? Well, when I'm in a good place I can deal with all sorts of things. But if I've had a bad day/week and I've been struggling to cope with the symptoms of PTSD then reading graphic details of violence, or worse yet, watching movies that have rape scenes or that depict abuse can be enough to tip me over the edge into a pit of terror and despair that it takes weeks to recover from.

I can keep my shit together more or less. I can use what resources I have to bring myself down from the extremes. But if I find myself indavertantly exposed to stuff that is retraumatizing it can really mess with me if I'm not prepared for it or I'm not in a good place. I'm not saying that people can't say or do as they like, or that media has to censor itself just for my sake. All I want to know is whether or not what I'm about to be exposed to may cause me to relive trauma. It doesn't have to be 100%. Just the most graphic and extreme stuff. Why? So I can make an informed choice on whether or not I can deal with whatever it is before I'm exposed to it and so I can take responsibility for my own reactions.",A,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B provides a personal and detailed account of how triggers can affect someone with PTSD, offering insight into the real struggles and challenges that individuals with trauma face. The explanation of how trigger warnings can help individuals make informed choices and take responsibility for their reactions is logical and empathetic. In contrast, Reply A, while acknowledging the existence of triggers, focuses more on the idea of triggers as a courtesy and does not provide the same depth of understanding of the impact triggers can have on individuals with PTSD."
predict-explain,"I don't know if it is skewed on Reddit or not, but anytime I see a comment about not being attracted to a ""slut"" the poster gets railed for it. I also don't think it is strictly the language being used. Regardless of the label, not wanting your partner to have been with 5+ people is 100% defensible. If we, as a society, can tell people that being tall is attractive or that being fat is unattractive, we can tell being that sleeping around is unattractive.     

Another logically invalid argument is that the person with the preference, must not be promiscuous themselves. I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he's hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner's choice in me, we can like different things. Many physically fit men are ""chubby-chasers"" and man slutty men are virginal chasers. 


Edit: To clarify, the use of the words ""slut"" earlier was merely a reflection of the term as it has been used on Reddit. I do not view a persons' worth as tied to their sexual history. I also don't have an moral qualms towards premarital sex or number of sexual partners. That said, my personal level of attraction is affected.

I hope the perspective I can offer on this is different enough from what has already been said to be of value to you. 

Here's my take. You state in your OP that preferences such as height and weight are generally accepted in our society. Absolutely true. You say in a comment that smoking is a deal breaker for you, that you would never date a woman who smokes. Fair enough. You also say this:

&gt;A context that came to mind when writing it is the /r/relationship[1] posts where the partner learns after-the-fact that his girlfriend/wife (or her husband/boyfriend) had more partners than originally assumed.

To me, the difference is that physical appearance and smoking affect you in the present. I could see deciding not to date someone because they have a reputation for promiscuity or because you correlate a higher number of sexual partners with an increased proclivity to cheat or an inability to maintain a healthy relationship. I'm not saying these correlations are correct, but I could understand your hesitation. However, in the scenarios you described, your wife or girlfriend is presumably a woman with whom you have built a solid trust, who has proven herself to be faithful and capable of being a partner. I can understand being upset if she lied to you about the number in the past, but even in this case, empathy suggests that she was probably embarrassed or fearful of judgment/rejection. In your scenario, breaking up with the girl for the number of sexual partners she has had is more accurately comparable with breaking up with her because she used to be fat or because she is an ex-smoker. A person can't change that they used to be fat or that they used to smoke or unsleep with past sexual partners, but they can lose weight and quit smoking and build a healthy monogamous relationship.

I also have qualms with this argument:

&gt;Another logically invalid argument is that the person with the preference, must not be promiscuous themselves. I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he's hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner's choice in me, we can like different things. Many physically fit men are ""chubby-chasers"" and man slutty men are virginal chasers.

What if instead of your example of physically fit men who are chubby-chasers, we are talking about obese women who only want to date men with six-pack abs? Or obese men who only want to date models? Yes, they are still entitled to have that preference, but most of us won't be surprised or particularly sympathetic when they don't find a partner. It is hypocritical because they want a partner who takes care of their body, but are not willing to put in the effort themselves. In the same respect, it is hypocritical for you to want a partner who has maintained her chastity, while not be willing to put forth the same effort. Women have a desire for sex too, and I think it is reasonable in this scenario to compare resisting the temptation to have sex with resisting the temptation to eat junk food or watch TV/play video games instead of going to the gym.

Lastly, I have one more angle to approach this from. With emerging adulthood and people getting married later, 5+ sexual partners is not necessarily promiscuous. Expecting a woman to be a virgin or have a very low number of previous sexual partners was much more reasonable when people were getting married in their late teens or early twenties. Now, with the average age of marriage closer to 30, many people will have had other significant relationships before they meet the person they marry. We have a longer period of time to work on and learn about ourselves before we settle down, and for many people this includes dating and sexual exploration. Personally, I'm averaging less than one new sexual partner per year since I started having sex, but my number is higher than 5. Yeah, if I got to go back as the person I am today, I would make some different decisions. But I've learned from them and I have no regrets. And I feel you dude, I don't like to think about the women my partner has been with either. But they brought him to me. In the end, unless they contracted an incurable STD or you believe sex is morally wrong, the people our partners slept with before they met us don't really matter. What matters is the person we are with now.","I think what you have identified is simply that there are socially sanctioned relationship preferences, and socially unsanctioned preferences, depending on context.

For instance, a man can have an internal, silent preference for lean women, but depending on the context, if he vocalizes it, he is likely to receive criticism.

Women who have a preference for tall men tend to face less open criticism for that preference, even when voiced openly.

Both genders tend to not be criticized for openly wanting an intelligent and/or successful partner, in the same way that both genders are essentially never criticized for not wanting a dumb loser.

These socially accepted preferences change over time, and what you are identifying is a universally condemned attribute transitioning out of that realm. For most of history, sexual promiscuity in women has been universally condemnable, and so it's not unexpected to have a large portion of people who still ascribe to that social custom. As customs go, there is no ""correct"" viewpoint. 

As western society has grown more progressive, this particularly female heavy bias against promiscuity has begun to equalize, and we are simply in the tumultuous transition period. There are plenty of people who say it makes zero difference in their choice, and plenty of people who only consider someone who is a virgin. Both are merely choices.

As far as your view goes, I don't necessarily disagree with your position, but I disagree with your oversimplification. 

Slut is a subjective term. Ask 10 people what it means and the only common thread will be sexual promiscuity. There will be a wide range of pejorative attitudes about the term, but the problem lies in the fact that it is exclusively an insult that gets wrongly applied to people with multiple sexual partners.

Consider a young woman, who is 32, and has had only serious boyfriends her whole life. She started dating at 16, lost her virginity to her first boyfriend, and has had a sexual relationship with each of her boyfriends, with a consistent duration of approximately 18-24 months per bf. This gives her a sexual partner range of 8-11 (rounding up). Now, to many people, the number 11 could seem like a high ""slutty"" number, when in reality she has merely had a long string of moderately long, monogamous relationships, that even allow for something as conservative as a 6-month waiting period before sex.

Consider another person, who had one serious relationship at 16, lost their virginity, broke up when she went to college, and then drunkenly slept with 5 guys in her first year. The next year she met her college sweetheart, and they stayed together for 12 years before breaking up. She is now roughly as old as the first woman, yet has only 7 partners. However, the means at which she got to her 7 as opposed the the other woman's 11 is monumentally different.

So while it doesn't necessarily mean nothing, it is a worthless metric without context. As both those women have had very different sexual pasts, and if you were taking either one of them on a date at 32, their respective pasts would mean very different things to you. 

Now, to bring it back to the word slut, you can see how using that word to describe either of them would mean **very** different things. One of them had a very slow accumulation of partners through 1.5-2 year relationships, and the other had the vast majority of all her partners during one short burst in college, with the previous decade+ being solely monogamous.",B,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a well-reasoned argument that challenges the original poster's stance on not wanting a partner with a higher number of sexual partners. The user in Reply A addresses the issue of trust and loyalty in a relationship, highlighting the importance of the present relationship rather than dwelling on past experiences. They also bring up the idea of hypocrisy in expecting a partner to meet certain criteria while not being willing to do the same. Additionally, Reply A discusses how societal norms and expectations have shifted over time, making the original poster's preference for a partner with a low number of sexual partners potentially outdated.

On the other hand, while Reply B also presents valid points about the subjective nature of the term ""slut"" and the importance of context in evaluating someone's sexual history, it doesn't directly challenge the original poster's views or provide as strong of a counterargument as Reply A does. Reply B focuses more on the complexities of defining promiscuity and the implications of using the term ""slut"", which may not directly address the original poster's concerns about partner preferences based on sexual history. 

Overall, Reply A offers a more comprehensive and direct rebuttal to the original poster's views, making it more likely to influence a change in perspective."
predict-explain,"This CMV was sparked by the reaction to Donald Trump from the right in the recent GOP Candidate Debate but extends to everyone who intentionally used political incorrectness for personal or political gain. 

Donald Trump, who was once considered a joke candidate is now leading most polls for the GOP nomination, mostly due to his unapologetic opinions  about things and his willingness to be open about his policies and ideas. He has also said that “I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct,” and to some extent I agree; political correctness has gone too far in this country and people need to be less offended by things. However, he has used ""political incorrectness""  as an excuse for his awful behavior and comments such as the mexican rapists invading our border and how Rosie O'Donell is a ""fat slob"" and instead of facing criticism for his opinions is being championed as some sort of visionary for people who's opinions don't align with the mainstream instead of the jackass that he is.

Part of the reason I joined reddit was because I couldn't share my political opinions anywhere with my name attached. If I mentioned I support Men's Rights or I hate the special snowflake attitude other unnamed sites had I would probably be killed. I go to a ~20% LGBT population High School (from a poll of the Freshman Class) which is incredibly SJW heavy. Remember the post that made the front of r/all about a month ago about the poster that said men couldn't be raped. That was a legitimate poster at my school.

Now here's the twist. If I said I hated the special snowflake attitude that Tumblr a very small portion of actual LGBT people would be upset. They know I support Gay Rights and I'm not a terrible person. The people that would get mad is the other 80% who hear the few mad people and think they should be mad as well. 

Would you say what I think is hateful or disrespectful. Not really. Would I be social shunned for so much as mentioning anything I belive in. Yes. That's just my personal experience (sob story) with me being censored by High School society. It may not be the same in the rest of the world and hopefully it is not.","Being politically correct has broad meanings.

It's ""politically incorrect"" to walk up to a black man in the street and say ""we don't want niggers in our town"".

It's also ""politically incorrect"" to tell Tumblr SOCJUS warriors they aren't raped when men look at them, or to say ""black"" when referencing an African-American (or using skin-color to differentiate a person ((the black guy over there at the bar)) in any case).

Political Correctness is hurting this country because it puts two filters on speech. The first is whether or not the way it was phrased or spoken in a way that no one can be offended in any way. Then the second is the content of the speech.

Being PC is also hampering our political process, as politicians are terrified of offending special interest groups like blacks. I specify blacks because recently Jim Webb (I think), A democrat (me being Republican) I admire for being more moderate and willing to come to the table and breaking from the increasingly extreme Democrat Party, got boo-ed at a rally for saying ""Black Lives Matter, White Lives Matter, Everyone's Life Matters"". Think about that, people were upset and shouting that a person acknowledged that everyone's life matters. Webb was forced to apologize the following day because he was ""down-playing the incredible hardship blacks have in today's America"".

As a footnote, I don't think he should have apologized, and blacks are not nearly as oppressed as they think they are.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a personal anecdote that illustrates the negative impact of political correctness on free speech and the ability to express differing opinions. The user explains how they feel censored and shunned for expressing their beliefs, even though they support gay rights. This personal experience may resonate with the original poster and help them see the negative consequences of political correctness in certain environments.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on criticizing political correctness in general terms and makes controversial statements about the oppression of certain groups. While the user makes some valid points about the limitations of political correctness, their argument may come off as more aggressive and less likely to persuade someone with a different viewpoint.

Overall, Reply A's personal story and reflection on the impact of political correctness is more likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially change their view."
predict-explain,"I live in canada so I don't know how this affect other countries but

You often see many youtube, TV, Radio and poster ads attacking other candidates and parties that mainly talk about how the other party/candidate would be bad for this country, the ads I have a problem with are **endorsed** by a political party that used taxpayer money to attack another political party. I think that to use taxpayer to further your own agenda is wrong.

I think that instead of using money to fund public dialogues that they can put on public networks, this would allow them to talk about what problems they have with other parties with the the other parties having the ability to respond and rebuttle if they have proof that they are wrong. 

I am also not that smart so I would love to hear any problems with my logic! CMV reddit

For my arguments I will be using a few sources: [#1](http://jonathanrose.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rose-in-Taras-Waddell.pdf), [#2](http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/irpp06%20rose.pdf) &amp; [#3](http://195.130.87.21:8080/dspace/bitstream/123456789/513/1/Political%20Marketing%20In%20Modern%20Canadian%20Federal%20Elections.pdf).



As I understand it your view is based on *negative* attack ads used by political parties, but not all ads used by the political parties are attack ads, or negative. (But please realize that negative is a loose term, even an ad that says something bad about another party's policy is ""negative"" even if it does it in a neutral tone. There's a specific term for that: acceptable negative.) Most ads tell us the priorities of competing parties and the differences in their policy platforms. They serve a very useful function: To provide voters with information in a simple manner that is easily recalled. Points made in debates are not easily recalled since they get lost in the back-and-forth.



Even negative ads serve a very useful function. They may be ugly, but they're often full of information regarding a political party's position on a policy or a candidate's weaknesses. They are actually scrutinized to a much higher level than positive ads and actually serve an important purpose in getting the public to engage with issues.



Negative ads are based on policy over personality in a 4:1 ratio, so the media's mania over the overinfluence of negative ads is overblown. In fact, as you can see from the second source I provided Canadians do not react favourably towards personal attack ads and all parties are wary of crossing a line and losing votes as a result. Some negativity is to be expected, but Canadians are pretty nice about it all.

Plus, there's the simple fact than one party (CPC) is the best at fundraising --probably because it's the only major right-of-centre party-- and it uses that money to produce ads b/w elections, when there's no restriction on spending. By banning attack ads, you're penalizing the other parties from being able to defend themselves from attacks b/w elections. Please take a close look at table 7.2 in the first source I've provided - the disparities in spending are shocking.


But what about your alternative of more debates? Is it really a good idea to have a LOT of debates and no ads? I don't think so. I watched the recent Maclean's Leaders Debate and while I enjoyed the debate, I was appalled at the post-debate analysis. The talking heads were discussing which *zinger* really hit home and how it would affect that leader's image. There was another section --the most awful one, in my opinion-- that had a ""[body language expert](https://youtu.be/hSf2__qpeGA?t=2h44m24s)"" analyze the body language of each of the candidates and draw conclusions on their personality **and** policy. It was AWFUL! If the television media actually cared about reporting on policy, I'd be with you for all debates all the time. But they boil it down to a competition among leaders that's part of the problem. The media's focus remains on ""the process of politics rather than its substance.""

I hope this changes your view.

Edit: clarity and fixed a link.

Edit 2: More edits for clarity and grammar.","You have admitted in other comments that you don't know how to draw the line between an ""attack ad"" and legitimate criticism. Since you don't know how to draw that line, your proposed ban would be unenforceable. In addition, it would be illegal since the government has no business determining what people can and cannot say, short of explicit and serious incitement to criminal conduct. The First Amendment forbids censorship.

However, there is a way to stop taxpayer money going to attack ads. Ban all taxpayer funding of any political campaign.",A,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a well-reasoned argument that highlights the importance and usefulness of negative ads in providing information to voters. It also addresses the potential downsides of relying solely on debates for political discourse. The user backs up their points with sources and provides examples to support their argument. Additionally, the user acknowledges the potential negative impact of attack ads but argues that they serve a valuable purpose in the political process.

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the legal aspects of banning attack ads and taxpayer funding of political campaigns. While it makes a valid point about the First Amendment and government censorship, it doesn't directly address the original poster's concerns about attack ads and taxpayer money being used for political attacks.

Overall, reply A provides a more comprehensive and well-supported argument that is likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially change their view."
predict-explain,"Why I hold this view:

1.  America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.

2. Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda executed a brutal plan to orchestrate the 9/11 attacks. [According to them, their major motivation was to end the presence of US in gulf countries and other motives as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks#Motives) For this purpose they chose to ram airplanes in the WTC  &amp; Pentagon to achieve maximum civilian casualties and make a frightening spectacle for the US public. The ends justify the means seems to be their reasoning. Was Al-Qaeda &amp; Co justified in perpetrating 9/11? 
No one would say yes.

     If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths. 


3. Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.

4. The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared. How do we even know the outcome of Operation Downfall? Moreover Japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the Secretary Of War, Henry Louis Stimson agreed: 

“Japan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.”


We erased two cities and its people from history. We dehumanized them, reduced them to a statistic. W[e even censored images and stories of the Japanese victims to push the narrative in our direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Depiction.2C_public_response_and_censorship). At least the Government should officially apologize to the nation of Japan.","&gt; America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.

The other way of ending the war was a full scale land invasion, which would have resulted in many more casualties and destruction than what the final atomic bombings caused.

[Japan was in no mood to surrender prior to this, or even after the first bombing.](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/the-pacific-war-1941-to-1945/operation-downfall/)

&gt; If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths.

YOu're completely ignoring the major military significance of those cities.

Hiroshima was a major army depot with many military headquarters, Nagasaki was a major industrial and port city home to many of the nation's war efforts, that had already been targeted before.

&gt; Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.

Apples and oranges to compare Al-Qaeda, a rogue terrorist organization and total war between nations.

[Everybody was attacking civilian targets in WW2.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II).  When nations go to war, that is what happens.

&gt; The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared.

You have no way of knowing that civilians would have been spared, they could just have easily have been conscripted to fight.

The Japanese had time and again shown that they *would not* surrender. [That they would candidly fight to the death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima), in Saipan [civilians killed themselves to avoid capture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saipan#Civilian_casualties)

&gt; “Japan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.”

And despite all that, they still refused to surrender. At some point, you have to acknowledge that the Japanese have culpability for some of this as well.

[To single out the atomic bombings as some kind of extra-inhumane effort on behalf of the USA, is little odd, given that our conventional air raids did much more damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raids_on_Japan)","Hiroshima and Nagasaki were entirely justified by the standards of the time. You're objection is also rather interesting, because you seem to be hung up on the use of nuclear weapons, when that's not even the worst thing that was done:

Hiroshima had 100,000 dead. Nagasaki is around 80,000.

Firebombing of Tokyo, using conventional weapons: 120,000.

Battle of Berlin: 200,000 dead, of which 22,000 were civilians, but where a massive number of the ""soldiers"" were actually conscripted elderly men and young boys.

Battle of Stalingrad: 1,700,000 to 2,000,000 casualties, 40,000 of which were civilians that fell to Luftwaffe air raids *in the first week.*

Rape of Nanking: Unknown, on the order of 100,000 to 300,000.

Battle of Okinawa: 120,000 soldiers killed, and 150,000 civilians killed or committed suicide, amounting to 1/4 of the local population. **Bear in mind that this happened immediately prior to the bombings, and were used as a case study as to what could happen if the US invaded the Japanese mainland.**

In addition, by this point in the war, 20,000 Chinese were dying every week under the Japanese occupation of China, which was still ongoing despite the disastrous nature of the Pacific campaign for Japan.

The fact of the matter is that Operation Downfall was something the US military wanted to avoid, particularly in the wake of Okinawa, where the civilians themselves fought off the US forces or committed mass suicide. The Japanese casualty figures for a mainland invasion were a direct extrapolation of what happened on Okinawa.

All told, 60,000,000 people (at least) died in World War II. There was significant evidence at the time that an invasion of Japan would have tacked on another 10,000,000 to 15,000,000.

In addition, the Japanese weren't going to surrender to the terms that the Allies demanded (which themselves were terms that were meant to prevent *another* world war from ever occurring). Ultimately, the bombings were a necessary event that brought an end to probably the most horrific decade our species has ever seen.

The comparison to 9/11 is also not appropriate, because the bombings were between two countries in a declared state of war, and where actual military targets were identified, and also in an era where civilian casualties were much more acceptable. In all likelihood, if we hadn't nuked the two cities, we would have obliterated them with conventional weapons. 9/11, on the other hand, was a direct attack against a target that was entirely civilian in nature, and against another target that was staffed almost entirely by civilians, and in the modern era where civilian casualties are no longer acceptable (largely due to the horrors of WWII, as well as Vietnam and Korea).",B,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a comprehensive comparison of the casualties and atrocities committed during World War II, highlighting that the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not the worst atrocities of the war. It also emphasizes the potential casualties that would have resulted from a land invasion of Japan, painting a picture of the dire situation at the time. Additionally, Reply B addresses the comparison to 9/11 and explains the context of the bombings within the norms of warfare at the time. Overall, Reply B presents a more thorough and well-supported argument that is likely to challenge the original poster's viewpoint."
predict-explain,"Uber is having a very public fight right now with NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, basically arguing that they should be allowed to compete with yellow cabs in a free market and that consumers should have a choice.  I would find this argument much more convincing if Uber weren't exempt from almost every rule and regulation by which the TLC governs traditional taxi services, on dubious legal grounds.  Yellow (and green) cabs in NYC must comply with many rules, including car safety inspections, emissions checks and other environmental regulations, and driver background checks.  Whether you agree with these rules or not (and I certainly have some questions about some of them), the fact remains that they are expensive to follow and that cost is of course passed on to the consumer by the cabs.  


Uber is not competing in a free market at all, in the sense of operating more efficiently to offer a lower price-- they're just gouging their competition by flouting the law.  If Uber (or anyone else) disagrees with these laws (such as the regulation of fares), they can of course use the political process to try to get them changed, but in that case they should be changed for regular cabs also.  There should never be a situation where there is one set of rules and regulations for regular cabs and a separate set for Uber.  


Uber is not and should not be above the law, no matter how cool and ""disruptive"" they might think they are.


**TO BE CLEAR: I am not arguing for or against any particular regulation.**  My argument is that, whatever the level of regulation you favor, Uber and yellow/green cabs should be held to the same standard.

Right, there shouldn't be. There are some places where Uber is lobbying to get itself exempted from existing regulations, and that's wrong.

But I think pretty much everyone agrees with you there. The question is what should happen in the cities where, due to old or poorly drafted laws, Uber isn't covered in the first place. Is it really their responsibility to follow the regulations anyway? Shouldn't the government have the responsibility to write fair laws?","&gt;My argument is that, whatever the level of regulation you favor, Uber and yellow/green cabs should be held to the same standard.

They don't provide the same service, so the same regulations are not applicable. No street-hail is the biggest difference. Uber already does background checks, etc., and they are very strict about banning drivers for bad behavior. Can you provide evidence that cabs are better or safer in any way vis-a-vis specific rules that they have to follow, while Uber drivers are ""getting away with"" skirting those rules?

They recognized an inefficiency in the market as it relates to taxi licensing and took advantage of that by offering a similar service that avoids those issues. About that part you are totally right. And for all the years and years of people trying to ""use the political process"" to get those inefficient laws changed changed with no success, within just a couple of years things are closer to changing than they ever would have been otherwise. There is no reason why they should have to handicap themselves by following laws that don't apply to them just because their service is similar to that of a taxi.",A,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"To be clear, I support the Supreme Court in their decision to legalize same-sex marriage, and I'm happy that rights that have been granted to heterosexual couples are now going to apply to everyone in society. I am, however, mildly concerned or at least intrigued as to where this debate or issue ends.

The reason it's troubling for me is that the most common arguments used to support gay marriage are that ""love is love"" and ""loving who you choose is your right"". What these arguments implicitly say is that the necessary criteria to be allowed to marry is that you love that which you are marrying.

Now I won't delve into the typical response of ""Next thing you know, it'll be legal to marry your pets!"" because I find that particularly hyperbolic and non-productive to the discussion. But I do feel that this open mindset of the definition of marriage will definitely lead to a future debate about what ""marriage"" is.

I believe that the next group to demand legal marriage rights will be polygamists, and that the same arguments of ""love is love"" will still apply. My fear is that despite this good ruling today, we have opened up the door to extremely loose and liberal interpretations of the meaning of ""marriage"" to include anything we want it to under the law.

~~Further, I believe that polygamy is harmful to society and that raising children in a polygamous is harmful to their growth. I believe that polygamy is not a natural arrangement for humans, and that no matter what, it will be emotionally damaging to at least one person in this ""relationship""~~.

But then as I type those words, I realize that the exact same things were said about gay marriage in recent history. So, Reddit, CMV that this supreme court ruling isn't going to evolve into a culture of people being able to marry whoever (or whatever) or however many people they want.

Edit: Let's avoid the moral implications of Polygamy for now. I shouldn't have typed out my personal views on the matter because it's really not what I'm interested in arguing (whether it's right or wrong). I'm interested in hearing legally, why this SC ruling will not lead to a case law precedent used to affirm Polygamy rights in the future. I ask this because all through this debate, most advocates for gay marriage rights said that comparisons of the movement to polygamy were ridiculous.

The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics.

Oliver wendal Holmes

You're right, the decision rendered today is s tad bit arbitrary. Anyone who's knowledgable and honest will admit that. But we currently have 38 states that allow SSM. The SCOTUS simply standardized a legal regime throughout the country because the people have essentially settled this issue. Their ruling reflects the whete society is today, not what's going to be.

So your view is incorrect because the SCOTUS is just trying to interpret law as society currently understands the law. It doesn't strive to be a math equation.","The basis of the Supreme Court's decision was the equal protection clause. The reason why the Court ruled the way that it did, was because the definition of marriage excluded an entire category of people.

Not every legal categorization is given heightened scrutiny by the courts. For instance, legal discrimination on the basis of age is typically legal. When the court asks whether a legal classification is ""suspect"" under the Equal Protection clause, they ask whether the subject class is:


* The group has historically been discriminated against, and/or have been subject to prejudice, hostility, and/or stigma, perhaps due, at least in part, to stereotypes. 

* possesses an immutable and/or highly visible trait. Lyng v. Castillo. 

* are powerless to protect themselves via the political process.  U.S. v. Carolene Products.

* The group's distinguishing characteristic does not inhibit it from contributing meaningfully to society. Frontiero v. Richardson.

So today's decision wasn't arbitrary. And these factors probably don't apply to polygamists. There are guidelines for this sort of stuff.",A,A,"I would say that reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a clear explanation of the legal basis for the Supreme Court's decision and highlights the specific criteria that the court considers when determining whether a legal classification is suspect under the Equal Protection clause. By addressing the specific factors that apply to the case of same-sex marriage, reply B effectively argues that these factors do not apply to polygamists, thus suggesting that the legalization of same-sex marriage does not necessarily open the door to polygamy. Reply A, while providing a quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes, does not directly address the legal reasoning behind the Supreme Court's decision and does not provide as strong of a counterargument to the original poster's concerns."
predict-explain,"so random battles that just happen with no warning, while you're walking, just like, warpy screen, you're in a battle now stuff. this really only applies to turn based games, in fact, i don't know of any real time games that have this system of enemy encounters. i don't think they have the need. 

it's annoying as hell. you take 4 steps after getting out of a battle, and arrive in another one that the run functino won't work for and you start taking damage, and then you can't escape again so you take more damage, and that just starts a whole snowball of ""oh my god fuck this shit."" meanwhile, the battles themselves are just often an unnecessary, repetitive, near useless way to grind. the millionth time we saw a zubat in pokemon, it. it wasn't really doing anything for us.

with an rpg game, the logic seems simple enough, i guess - there's a turn based system of combat, and there needs to be a way to trigger the combat screen from the overworld. and it shouldn't necessarily be purely predictable, should it? the player needs to progress and level up so they can meet their bigger challenges in the future. putting aside the discussion about other games mechanics and why in some cases it works much worse than others - there's just better, non annoying ways of doing that now. off the top of my head, paper mario on n64 had visible enemy mobs walking around. if you collided with them, you started a battle. that makes *much* more sense. it's not annoying. it doesn't happen every five steps. it doesn't come out of nowhere. it still accomplishes the same purpose that random encounters do. invisible enemies starting a 5 second battle transition, with a chance that you can't run, especially if you're in over your head and trying to get out of an area, with no ability to see it coming, no warning, no possibility of avoiding it, is just, bad. especially when even something like the paper mario system exists. at least that way, if you have no items, and are on your way back to somewhere because you're too injured, you have a chance of maybe avoiding the enemy mobs.

The result of this was that dungeons weren't very dangerous: you could always choose to walk out safely if things got too hot, and you could always push forwards to see if you were at the end and then make a decision if you saw monsters in the way.  Older console RPGs had more of a sense of tension: the awareness that you might be ambushed made dungeons in Dragon Warrior or Phantasy Star feel like very dangerous places, and you felt really accomplished if you managed to clear one out and escape with your life.

Also, games like Paper Mario and Final Fantasy Mystic Quest can use this sort of visible enemy system because they have no overworlds.  Monsters could be set up in bottlenecks in dungeons, but on the overworld there would be no way to force confrontations since you could walk around any enemy you see.  That would completely remove overworld exploration as a mechanic, since there's no danger in exploring if you're certain you'll never be attacked.","http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/221-rpgs-square-enix/61428436

&gt;I also LOVE random encounters. For a lazy gambling man like me who doesn't want to have to use strategy when picking my battles, they are a godsend. Also for grinding, because in FFXII etc, once you've cleared out the area, you have to go a certain amount of screens away for them to respawn, where with random encounters, you can just run around.

Additionally, the explanation of why visible enemies work in games like Paper Mario and Final Fantasy Mystic Quest due to the lack of an overworld further strengthens the argument.

predict-explain,"So, I hope this CMV is not to specific for this sub, but I dont see this discussion working in the main LoL subreddits without getting downvoted into oblivion.

The current structure of League of Legends is that there are Leagues in the 5 major regions (EU, NA, KR, CN, Taiwan) and they meet two to three times a year for some international competition. The international competiton usually consists of a third-party tournament, the IEM World Championship, and two Riot organised events, the Mid Season Invitational and the Riot World Championship (the ""real"" worlds). Of these three only the Riot Worlds is the only really big tournament, with 16 teams and a good playoffs and group stage format.
MSI features only the best team of each region and the IEM World Championship uses Bo1 groups into Bo3 in the first playoff bracket, which is often criticised as too random for the title.
The league structure in all major regions is usually divided into a spring and a summer league with a regular season of 18-40 games or so, followed by playoffs to see determine who the best teams in the region are.

In the other major eSport titles (Dota, SC2, CSGO) you have 

* way more tournaments in general

* way more international competition in general

* more important games, as you have more playoff situation

This all leads to my opinion that LoL eSports has the most boring circuit, as the majority of the matches that are being played are low impact matches in the regular season and only in domestic competition.



**Edit:** I would appreciate if you help me understand some of the arguments that you apparently think brushed aside. All I see is that you downvoted me, without really understanding why. I would really appreciate if you be patient with me and make me understand what excactly I am missing that should change my view.


**Edit2** Thanks to everyone who was patient with me and argued even if I didnt seem to get your point. I have some more stuff to think and while my view wasnt really changed I got some stuff to think about. Maybe I will come back in the near future with some of the core issues I see now clearer which are the basis for my view.

Good Night everybody!


**Edit3** Since this is over eSport lets make some shameless plug: There are atm tournaments going on:

http://www.twitch.tv/faceittv This is the faceit final at Dreamhack Valencia with CS:GO, where some of the best team battle for a prizepool of 150,000 $

http://www.twitch.tv/dreamhacksc2 This is the Dreamhack Valencia tournament for SC2 with a prizepool of 25.000 $

And while I dont have a link ready atm, there is also the IEM Shenzen in SC2 going on with some of the greatest players from Korea, also competing for a prizepool of 25.000$.

predict-explain,"A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a Uzi submachine gun on full automatic.

From some comments various people have left on this and the reporting it seems that it is not unusual for kids even younger then that to shoot real firearms.

This is ridiculous. Children (and I define that in this case as everyone under 18) are not nearly responsible enough to handle them. There is a reason we do not let little children drive cars or drink alcohol etc.

Childrens Brains (and even young adult's, but you have to draw the line somewhere) are still in the process of developing. We all have done stupid shit as children. Hell, just here on reddit I read about some guy who shot his brother *twice* as a kid. You may choose not be believe that story, but for me it seems plausible.

I know btw that the Instructor in this case made some critical mistakes as well, and that children shooting firearms have to be supervised. But still, if the Girl had the experiance, wisdom and patience that comes with being an adult, this would have never happened. 

An adult acts as another layer of protection to prevent an accident. In my view, having a child handle a firearm is a little like not exercising proper trigger discipline. If you do everything else right, nothing bad can really happen. But you should never rely on doing everything else right.

You might know some very mature and patient 14 year old who is really interested in hunting or sport shooting. In that case, congratulations. But I still stand by my view that that kid should wait and grow four more years. Sure, they might not get to shoot for four your years, but nobody will die.

EDIT:

/u/caw81 has slightly changed my view. Now I think only people under the age of 16 should be barred.

EDIT 2:

This is because Reply A provides a real-world example of children as young as 10 years old safely participating in shooting activities in Switzerland without incident. The inclusion of pictures from the Knabenschiessen event adds a visual element to the argument and helps to show that it is possible for children to handle firearms responsibly under the right circumstances. 

On the other hand, while Reply B makes a valid point about training and gradual progression in gun use for children, it does not provide concrete evidence or examples to support its argument. Without real-world examples or evidence, it may not be as convincing to the original poster. 

Overall, Reply A is more persuasive because it provides a tangible example of responsible gun use by children, which could potentially change the original poster's view on the topic."
predict-explain,"Donald Trump is a decent businessman who inherited his capital. He's a punchline. A rich punchline, but a punchline all the same.

His views on immigration would not only alienate the countries south and north of the border, essentially saying they can't be trusted not to ""send"" their criminals here, but it would make us look paranoid to the rest of the world. People can come to the U.S. as tourists from several countries, not just Mexico, completely legally. They then can slip into the sea of people and stay, illegally. The problem with illegal immigration is much more complex than he seems to realize.

The man has no foreign policy experience. Boardroom deals with businessmen and bureaucrats from another country does not equate to nation-to-nation diplomacy.

His national defense ideas that I've heard seem to amount to, ""more guns and let's tell other countries to screw off.""

The Democrats' stance that the rich want to influence policy to get richer does not exclude Donald Trump. Who is to say he wouldn't endorse policies that would make it easier for both him and his kids to double their fortune?

Every president is a punchline to the opposition. Reagan was pretty great and considered a complete joke.  People derided Clinton and he did an admirable job.  Wilson was mocked but was mostly right.  Lincoln was vilified but righteous.  

The deference between politics and business have never been much.  In most places people transition from successful businessman to school board or governor all the time.  Trump may be skipping traditional step but that does not make him unqualified.  I don't think you would argue that being governor of Nebraska for two years would suddenly change your opinion of the man. 

As far as his particular views on immigration and defense, he is not saying anything that other candidates have said in the past.  Don't be shocked if you hear other republican candidates start to mimic him if he remains popular.  Ones side extremist is the other sides voice of reason.  

Your last statement concerning the rich shows a bias.  Democrats and republicans bemoan money and politics while participating in the corruption.  

I would be surprised if you are persuaded to CYV but I think you should recognize the reasons you listed are not evidence for you view but simple evidence of your view.  As for my view, he wouldn't be any worse or any better than anyone else.  The president is not as influential as people think and in 4 years america would not be tremendously different with or without him.","Trump has zero interest in being president and he won't, but if he did win, he would be an average president.

Remember how people on the liberal side thought he would have ended all wars by 2012?

What really happened is what always happens. They get to power and realize how little they really can do because of the way the power steucture in America is set up.

Universal health care became Obamacare, which is a very little improvemwnt and still leaves the money machine which is the health industry intact.

Obama and Clinton were also very active militarily and hatdly pacifists. Bush didn't introduce serious attempts to ban abortions. Status quo prevailed, and the wars and trade agreements that are negociated far from the white house took place.

predict-explain,"If population replacement rates are below the rate of no growth or at stagnation, things are going to be better in the future. As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available. On a nationwide scale, decreasing population means available work. Natural resources of food, water, fuel, and other materials are becoming scarcer everyday. On a global scale, less population means more available goods to all. What result(s) of an increasing population size could surpass these benefits? If we were hypothetically at the growth cap for the human population, would everybody still get frantic like when it's is brought up that the U.S. born citizen population is reproducing below replacement?

Edit: it seems a lot of the response pertain to economy. I suppose I was wrong in respect to a declining population being beneficial in this aspect. However, I still seem to feel that a shrinking population would benefit us as a species. Our survival, and that of our environment, would be better off with less people. But still, I'm open to changing my view.","A shrinking population is, by mathematical definition, an aging population.

This brings with it a *lot* of undesirable effects. Investing for the future (not even in the economic sense, but in the general sense) requires certain assumptions to change. Even if you say ""hmm the population will be aging so we need to shift our production towards things that older people can consume,"" you'll deal with the unfortunate side effect that the absolute number of people at any certain age will shrink, too. So the very fundamentals of planning for the future starts breaking all the rules we thought were ironclad. Will our future population be smarter than the current population? Does the modeling account for age-related mental slowdown (or full on dementia)? Will our future population be weaker, slower, less flexible, etc.? What does this mean for our future survival as a species? Altogether, it's a problematic issue to plan around.","First of all the people who are worried about declining population are worried about it for different reasons. 

1) Declining national power. They believe that in the world much of a nation's power is attributed to its absolute population/economic size.

2) Many systems set up in a world of growing population will no longer be sustainable in a world of declining population. In the U.S. context Social Security retirement (SSR) becomes less sustainable as their are fewer a fewer working age people per SSR recipient. 

-

Second of all, all of your facts are in contention.

&gt;As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available.

Automation is not a new thing, and has been occurring since the beginning of time (when the first hunter picked up a rock and was able to do the work of ten hunters) , but has ramped up since the mid 1700's industrial revolution.  Your belief is called the Lump of Labor Fallacy in economics.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy


&gt;Natural resources of food, water, fuel, and other materials are becoming scarcer everyday.

Actually they're not. The continuous increase in automation (also called increases in labor productivity) has meant that we are able to produce more and more goods given the same inputs. Also, increases in technology (or technological know how, also closely related to your increases in automation) has meant that we can access more and more inputs.  Peak oil predictors have been wrong for several decades.  


&gt;less population means more available goods to all. 

Actually larger population mean more and more final consumption goods available to consume and at a greater than linear rate. This can be explained by a concept called comparative advantage which allows specialization and gains from trade.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage

https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=gains%20from%20trade%20specialization


But essentially as the size of the population in an economy grows people can specialize more and more into what they are best suited actually increasing total production faster than the population growth rate.  

As a secondary effect with specialization individuals become better at doing their more narrowly definded production than they were at any given task when they used to have to do more of them.  This idea was first expounded by Adam Smith in his parable of the pin-factory (which also covers much else that has been previously discussed here).

This is because Reply B provides a more detailed and thorough explanation of the potential drawbacks of a shrinking population, as well as refuting some of the original poster's points with evidence and economic principles.

Overall, Reply B presents a more convincing argument that challenges the original poster's beliefs and provides a more comprehensive analysis of the issue."
predict-explain,"First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are devoted to saving the panda because pandas are extremely well known and popular, not because they have a good chance of survival.   Here are the reasons I believe this:
  
1) Pandas have lost much of their natural habitat due to the population explosion in China.  While this is regrettable, it is not likely to get fixed anytime soon. This means that even if we are able to revive this species they won't have anywhere to live.   
  
2) pandas, as a species, have chosen poorly. They are carnivorous animals who's main diet is bamboo. Their digestion can only process about 5% of the stuff in bamboo. That means they have to eat huge amounts of bamboo everyday. With the reduced habitat this is getting harder and harder. Either they need some microevolutionary shift to eat more nutritious sources of food orthey should join the likes of the dodo bird.   
  
3) human efforts to revive the population have shown some increases, but at what cost? It is incredibly difficult to get pandas to mate with one another, it's like they don't even want their species to survive. I get they aren't actually making this choice, this is just a facetious way of saying that their instincts and biology do not support the kind of growth in population hey need. Hell, half of their births are twins and the mother almost always lets one die because she doesn't produce enough milk. I realize this would take evolution to fix and this problem is way too short term, but it means that their survival requires an exorbanant amount of human intervention. Since their is a finite amount of resources conservationists can dedicate to endangered resources they are killing other more likely to survive species.  
  
4) I'm not saying we should encourage the decline of the panda. We should still try to preserve what habitat they have left and ban hunting them, but they are so far gone and require so much help that we shouldnt waste too many resources on them. Let the panda try to support a small and natural population without our interference. If they cannot achieve this goal, I don't think it's worth the resources to help them grow.","The WWF wants to promote biodiversity in a variety of things other than Pandas. However, average people who are interested in donating tend to care disproportionately more about pandas and other cute animals. Supporters may donate solely on an emotional desire to keep the pandas alive (in the face of the points outlined in your OP), but that doesn't mean the the WWF can't allocate the funds to less sexy, harder to advertise causes that might not attract the same financial support. That's to say that in addition to the intrinsic social and environmental value of saving pandas, the WWF can do more good across the board with the money that is donated with the pandas in mind.","I don't think it's a waste of money. In short, we conserve pandas because people like them. Whoever spends the money on keeping pandas around has already considered this, and he thinks it's worth it.

Many other things, such as music and balloons could be considered a waste of resources if people didn't like them.",A,A,"I would say Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a practical perspective on the issue, acknowledging the emotional attachment people have to pandas but also highlighting the potential for the WWF to allocate funds to other important conservation efforts. By emphasizing the broader impact of donations and the potential for the organization to do more good with the funds raised for pandas, Reply A presents a compelling argument for continuing to support panda conservation efforts. On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the emotional appeal of pandas and the subjective value people place on them, which may not address the original poster's concerns about resource allocation and the challenges facing panda conservation."
predict-explain,"Both my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of being in the main stream, I'm still not convinced that vaccines are all they are cracked up to be. 

Between whistle blowers (William Thomson, Scott Cooper, Andrew Wakefield etc) and corruption within the vaccine industry, it seems like something sinister is afoot. There are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest.

Now I'm not antivaccine (although I haven't been immunized yet) I'm just not pro vaccine. I haven't seen enough to discredit this dark side of things and show undoubtedly that vaccinations are the way to go.

Please change my view.","I totally with /u/RustyRook as he says vaccines are one of the single greatest medical interventions that human beings have ever developed. The only reason I think that so many people distrust vacinnes is due to the Lancet article of Andrew Wakefield. Which been [retracted](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2897%2911096-0/abstract) and after investigation Wakefield was struck off the medical register in the UK. 

There have been many studies on vaccines and autism and to my knowledge all of them have concluded that vaccines do not cause autism. I just go through a couple here. 

* [H. Honda et all.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2005.01425.x/pdf) have studied children in Yokohama. With the hypothesis: Vaccines causes autism. They saw the vaccination rate drop, but the autsim rate go up. Conclusion: ""MMR vaccination is most unlikely to be a
main cause of ASD.""
* [K.M. Madsen et al.](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa021134) Research from Denmark. A studie of 537,303 children. Conclusion: ""This study provides strong evidence against the hypothesis that MMR vaccination causes autism.""
* [J.S.Gerber et al.](http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/48/4/456.full) They've took 20 studies done in different countries and reviewed them. Conclusion: ""These studies, ...,  have effectively dismissed the notion that vaccines cause autism.""
* [B. Taylor](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2214.2006.00655.x/abstract?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=) also a literature review. Conclusion: ""There is no scientific evidence that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine or the mercury preservative used in some vaccines plays any part in the aetiology or triggering of autism, ... ""
* [W. Chen et al.](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=211213&amp;fileId=S0033291703001259) studied people with autism and down syndrome born between 1959 and 1993. In this group there were children that were not vaccinated, vaccinated with only the measles vaccine and vaccinated with the MMR vaccine (the same vaccine used in the article of Wakefield) Conclusion: ""No increased risk of AD following exposures to wild measles and vaccinations with monovalent measles, and Urabe or Jeryl–Lynn variants of MMR was detected.""

I can find a lot more studies that conclude vaccines and autism don't have a connection. What I can't find however is a scientific study that concludes that vaccines causes autism. If you know  one I'm very interested to read it. 

From what I understand the autism thing is the biggest problem for the anti-vaxers, but if there is more I'm willing to go into it with you.","What are the main heath concerns that you have with vaccines? Are they worse than the potential medical issues that could arise from people not being vaccinated?

Aside from that, there are some people who can't get vaccinated because of certain medical issues. These people rely on heard immunity to protect themselves from the diseases that vaccinations are supposed to prevent. If more people who can get vaccinated don't, it puts those who can't get vaccinated at a greater risk to develop some of the issues that vaccines can prevent. If everyone who can get vaccinated does, it makes it much less likely that these medical issues develop on a large scale.",A,A,Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides concrete evidence in the form of multiple scientific studies that have concluded there is no connection between vaccines and autism. The reply also addresses the main concern of the original poster and offers to discuss any additional concerns they may have. Reply A presents a logical and evidence-based argument that may help persuade the original poster to reconsider their stance on vaccines.
predict-explain,"This view of mine might sound obvious or simple but I think a lot of sensitive, complex social issues have simple underlying causes that are often ignored. In fact, I think they are so often ignored that I start to doubt my own view, hence this post. I'm a little embarrassed to share it. Here's my basic line of thought:

* Stereotypes exist because the generalization is accurate.
* Several of society's popular problems are blamed on other people acting with an awareness of stereotypes, or the stereotypes themselves.
* A lot of cases regarding these problems are caused or made worse by the victim acting in accordance with a stereotype while blaming either the stereotype or something else.
* If people made more of a conscious effort to not act in accordance with a stereotype in a situation where the stereotype could be considered relevant less incidents would occur.
* When less incidents occur the stereotype changes or evaporates completely. 

'Victim' is somewhat of a loose term here (I'm excluding people who are indirectly involved with an incident pertaining to whatever social ill anyone might refer to) so before you shout ""victim blaming!"" I'll freely state that yes, I believe victims are *very rarely* 100% free from some kind of responsibility. 

An example would be a black man being pulled over in a bad neighborhood and getting ticketed, arrested, or worse after arguing with/ resisting the police officer. We *might* be able to argue the man was unfairly profiled, but we can't prove something like that. It's much easier to take preventative measures (respect and compliance with the officer, no matter how shitty of a person they may be) and either avoid the situation completely or not make it harder than it needs to be. But once the black driver starts getting loud and upset, in the cops mind he's just another loud black person (fulfilling the stereotype) which could lead the officer to believe that the driver fulfills other aspects of his stereotype. 

Another quick example would be the stereotype of men only being interested in sex and men saying ""not all men are pigs."" Well, if that stereotype upsets you as a man, the only thing you can really do that will have any kind of effect is to not be a pig! But nobody seems to realize this, they just want everyone else to do what they ask. 

Obviously I'm not proposing an over-night fix to any social issue, but what I'm proposing would benefit our society a lot more than victims telling everyone else to stop stereotyping. Pointing the finger at the aggressor(s) doesn't actually help solve the whole problem; all that does is either end that individual incident or piss people off. That shortsightedness does absolutely nothing to solve the problem on any kind of large, lasting scale. 

I'm happy to edit for any needed clarification.

Prove it. This is a sheer question of fact: If ""the generalization is accurate"" in every case of harmful stereotype, then it shouldn't be hard to prove.

predict-explain,"Disclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said:

What happens after the honeymoon period when one person still desires sex, but their partner has lost interest (commonly referred to as a [dead bedroom](http://reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms))?

I think it's still the duty of the disinterested party to at least minimally fulfill the sexual needs of their partner, if sustaining the relationship is a priority. In bullet form, here's why:

* Each partner in the relationship is the others' only source of intimacy and sex (assuming a monogamous relationship), therefore if one partner withholds sex, the physical needs of the other is not being met. What is ultimately a chore or an inconvenience for one partner is a physiological necessity for the other.

* Compromise is fundamentally part of every aspect of a relationship, and sex is no different. I'm conflicted in my thinking on this point: No one should be made to have sex if they don't want to. However, both my SO and I do things for each other that we don't necessarily want to do because it's better for the relationship, or it makes the other happy. I don't believe sex and intimacy should be treated differently- it's reasonable to have expectations of sex as a requirement of the relationship.

Thoughts?","You make some really good points, OP. One thing to consider is that sex is not a physiological need, people go without it all the time. The benefits of orgasm can be achieved through masturbation, and the benefits of intimacy can be achieved through cuddling and other intimacy beside sex. If the partner also objects to cuddling and so on, then the high libido person can get this from people outside the relationship, just as a single person would.","First off great job on this CMV it's not often I see people this committed to meaningful debate, especially on this subreddit it seems.

I do believe you are wrong though if you're trying to say that your partner should feel responsible for satisfying your sexual needs. I would agree however that you share a responsibility with your partner to work out your problems in a way that you can both be happy with.

Specifically I would suggest jerking off or agreeing to have sex with other people. If the institutions you follow prevent you from having a satisfying relationship or you are unable to come to a compromise with your spouse then you might reconsider the institution or the spouse.",B,A,"I would say that Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A presents a different perspective on the issue by arguing that sex is not a physiological need and that intimacy can be achieved through other means besides sex.

Additionally, Reply A suggests alternative solutions such as masturbation or seeking intimacy outside the relationship, which may open up new possibilities for the original poster to consider.

predict-explain,"First things first: I know this sounds kind of stupid, but 100% serious here; not a troll.
Dogs are not Disney cartoons. Yes, they're thinking, feeling creatures, but their ways of communication could hardly be any more different from ours. A dog leaping onto you is not expressing affection; it's literally asserting dominance. A dog dragging you by the leash is not eager to play; it's showing you who the top dog is and ordering you to follow the pack leader (itself). A dog making eye contact is, again, asserting dominance--read: not affectionately gazing into its master's eyes. The list goes on. Seems like we've anthropomorphizing our cuddly partners a bit too much. Chances are, it's probably not thinking what most people think it's thinking. A dog that looks ""depressed"" to most of us is really just an obedient dog with a responsible owner. Man's best friend? That's some grade-a bull. Man's best friend is none other than fellow man. Dogs have no capacity for logic / reasoning skills and will bark at any stranger to feel better about themselves. We don't understand them very well, and they understand us even less. They've helped our hunter-gatherer ancestors, and are still useful to people with certain disabilities today. But that makes them no more than co-workers and can hardly be considered potential friends, given our inherent differences in nature. Dog experts of reddit, I'd love to have my mind changed on this one because I literally can't look at dogs anymore without thinking they are incredibly savage and overly-hierarchical creatures undeserving of our attention.

A dog might demonstrate that same behavior when it sees its owner for the first time in a couple of days/weeks, clearly excited at the prospect of seeing its owner again.","Your information about pack leaders, hierarchies, alphas, and dominance among dogs has been debunked.

One quote from a Time article:

&gt; The debate has its roots in 1940s studies of captive wolves gathered from various places that, when forced to live together, naturally competed for status. Acclaimed animal behaviorist Rudolph Schenkel dubbed the male and female who won out the alpha pair. As it turns out, this research was based on a faulty premise: wolves in the wild, says L. David Mech, founder of the Minnesota-based International Wolf Center, actually live in nuclear families, not randomly assembled units, in which the mother and father are the pack leaders and their offspring's status is based on birth order. Mech, who used to ascribe to alpha-wolf theory but has reversed course in recent years, says the pack's hierarchy does not involve anyone fighting to the top of the group, because just like in a human family, the youngsters naturally follow their parents' lead (http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2007250,00.html)

Specifically what value is there in staying the same gender your whole life?   People are living longer and longer in a rapidly changing world.  People don't just have one job, with one employer their whole lives anymore, why should they stick to one gender.  People get tattoos, lasic vision correction, lose weight, gain weight, get abs, boob jobs, face lifts, take anti-represents to change their personality and change their bodies and brains in all kinds of ways from the baseline genetic profile.  Why should we put gender or sex into a special box where it shouldn't change?  Not that you should have to do any of these things unless you want to.  If you want to, we have the technology, many who have done it are happier for it, so why not?","One of the ideals many people see in a Utopia is the abolition of gender. This is the changing of gender roles so much that the two genders become indistinguishable and gender no longer matters. In such a world, transgender people would feel entirely comfortable because there would be no expectations attached to their genitalia. However, with our current society and biology, such a world is a long way off. 

Transgender people are for the most part not changing their gender. They were born with a particular sex, yet this does not match their actual internal gender. Coming out is basically admitting to the world that your mental gender differs from your physical sex, in the same way that people who are coming out as gay are not changing their sexual orientation. They were always gay. Transgender people were always the same gender inside, but they simply did not admit it to the world.",A,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a different perspective on the issue of transgender individuals by framing it as aligning with the concept of a utopian society where gender roles are abolished. It also emphasizes the idea that transgender individuals are not changing their gender, but rather acknowledging and accepting their true internal gender identity. This perspective may help the original poster see transgender individuals in a different light and understand their experiences better. 

Reply A, while raising valid points about the ability to change various aspects of oneself in today's society, does not directly address the original poster's concerns about the necessity of changing genders. It focuses more on the idea of change in general rather than specifically addressing the issue of gender identity."
predict-explain,"I'll allow that, in most cases, the misbehaving kid is just throwing a temper tantrum, but what do you do in cases where the kid has thrown himself on the floor in the middle of a restaurant and the waiters are going to trip over him and the parents are refusing to do anything about it? The rest of us have just become too polite of a society and other people who are affected by the bad behavior or might be injured in cases where the kid is throwing things, biting and kicking other people should be justified in disciplining a misbehaving child in a way that doesn't cause welts. Just a few instances of getting knocked on his butt by a complete stranger should be enough to get it through the kid's head that this is not something you do in public.","As a parent of two young children (2 1/2 and 4), I know that children can be highly unpredictable if their routine is broken. In a perfect world, I'd have my youngest in bed by 7:15 and oldest in bed by 9. That isn't always possible with life events (car is breaks down, need to wait by the repair shop, only place within walking distance for children is a family restaurant because they need to be fed. Or you're out for an extended family dinner, or whatever). 

I personally remove my children from the situation/area on the rare occurrences they pitch a major fit in public. I also get very annoyed with parents who ignore their kids in public places when they pull that shit. 

A customer, however, do not know the entire circumstances or get to dictate to me how I deal with my children. If I'm alone with my two children and one is having a meltdown in a restaurant, I need to get the second child at the table packed up to leave as well. If he's covered in food, that means a quick cleanup. He's likely to get pissed I'm taking him away from his food unexpectedly, and won't understand as he's 2. So now I might have two kids melting down. I might need to locate a staff member to tell them I'm not bailing on the bill or food, just stepping out to calm one of the kids down. This can take a couple minutes while I'm trying to keep the one having a meltdown calm. If you as a customer get antsy while this is happening and hit my kid, I'll punch your teeth out.

Not to mention there can be extenuating circumstances. I have friends with young children that have mild developmental and mental disorders that can make their behavior unpredictable. They're capable of leading semi-independent lives and their doctor/child therapist recommendations are to get the kids out and with others to start adjusting them to different situations. You have no idea if the kid is on the autism spectrum, and hitting them is the worst thing you can do.","Hitting someone else is never ""justified"".  Even if it causes their life to improve 500 times over you can't just hit people because you don't like what they are doing. Especially a child could be horrified of going outside in future thinking someone 10 times their size might just hit them to the ground when they're doing something. 

But verbally scolding them or telling them what they are doing is bad is fine in my eyes, but of course the mother/father will rightly so be angry you're going to upset their child. I highly doubt there would be many situations when the parent would feel happy you're treating their child bad. But you can let them be mad, you're..In theory..Doing the right thing, if you can take a bit of verbal abuse back at yourself and brush it off then go for it. Tell them to stop doing what they are doing and act properly. 


If there's a kid on the floor a waiter should speak up and ask ""who's child is this?"" and if they refuse to make him behave they should be removed from the restaurant. 




Basically I think your idea is fine but you'd be going about it wrong.  You should watch the movie whiplash, it has that kind of abusive relationship to force someone to do what they should be doing. I think you might like that, plus it's a good movie.

 If you watch that movie you might be able to see how the child would be feeling in that situation, doing something wrong and being scolded over and over until you finally get it right is a very hard process and most likely won't work unless the person wants to change or is forced to.  Most children will grow out of it and understand what they are doing is wrong once they're forced into a school where behaving normal would be enforced properly, until then it'll mostly be up to the parents.  Your efforts at trying to change them could work amazingly, but most probably be a waste of time. The best you can do is get them to be removed and explain politely to the parents they need to control their child.",A,A,"I would say reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B acknowledges the frustration the original poster feels towards misbehaving children in public places but emphasizes that hitting someone, especially a child, is never justified. It offers alternative solutions such as verbally scolding the child or asking the restaurant staff to intervene. Reply B also brings up the idea of empathy towards the child and how abusive behavior towards them may not be effective in changing their behavior in the long run. 

Overall, Reply B provides a more compassionate and understanding approach to dealing with misbehaving children in public, which may resonate more with the original poster and potentially change their perspective on the issue."
predict-explain,"Recently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news ([x](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/hilary-clinton-the-sight-black-man-hoodie-scary-open-minded-whites/), [x](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/hilary-clinton-the-sight-black-man-hoodie-scary-open-minded-whites/)) after delivering a speech in which she said that ""for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear."" Publications from across the political spectrum tore her a new one for this comment in perceived poor taste. The article from the Federalist was spread on tumblr, and eventually popular user katara [reblogged with the full context](http://hunty.us/post/125041947641/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) of the quote, and people started criticizing the people passing around the articles for taking things out of context / not doing their research.    

(Here's where my opinion comes in.) I think that tumblr's reputation of false alarm and out-of-context sound bites isn't unique to tumblr at all, it's the way popular American media has operated for the last few decades- if not more. [Many](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/09/18/just-the-scandal-of-the-week-or-a-turning-point/the-news-media-and-its-soundbite-culture) [people](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/our-sound-bite-culture-sh_b_93720.html) have discussed the ""sound-bit culture"" that becomes especially popular in presidential election cycles. Given that this is the norm for modern day news, I think politicians have a responsibility to avoid creating problematic soundbites.   

Specifically, I think Clinton doesn't deserve the sympathy she's getting from [people](http://bleecake.tumblr.com/post/125130165347/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) who feel as though the media took her quote out of context. Clinton has been a politician for DECADES, she's got more experience than practically anybody- she's gone through 2 successful presidential election campaign as a candidate's spouse and this is her second presidential campaign as a candidate herself. She's been in more controversy over the years than anybody can keep track of. She's got almost unanimous support from the Democratic party, and lord knows she can afford good speechwriters and campaign managers. So why in the hell would she deliver a speech with the sentiment of basically ""Black people are scary... is what a racist would say. Racism is bad."" Surely, she knows people are only gonna take the first bit of that clip, and they're gonna run with it.    

To me, the fact that this ""quotable"" passed through all the levels of Clinton's campaign team is just an indicator of how little anyone working for Clinton (including herself) really gives a shit. She could wake up tomorrow and say she intends on starting a nuclear war with Iran, and she'd still get the Democratic nomination. Because of that, I think the media has the right (and responsibility) to challenge Clinton. A good candidate is a candidate who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context.    

We (the American people) are not getting the candidate we want or deserve, because we keep tripping over ourselves to help out Clinton.

But that seems an utterly silly thing to say, and I'm saying that as someone who really dislikes Hillary. 

Racism is not something that can be discussed in a sound bite. It is not something that can be properly discussed entirely within the context of a speech. Policy is not something that should be made or broken on the back of a couple of well placed sentences. 

So to properly answer your question: 
&gt;So why in the hell would she deliver a speech with the sentiment of basically ""Black people are scary... is what a racist would say. Racism is bad."" 

Is not even what she was saying. Her speech was rather saying, ""People have these little biases and racist thoughts, and we should constantly challenge these thoughts."" Of course, it might be helpful to elucidate on what exactly she means with that.

I think the consequence is that we've actually limited the public debate, and insulted our own intelligences in the process.",A,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B effectively challenges the original poster's belief that politicians should avoid creating problematic soundbites by highlighting the complexity of discussing important issues like racism in short soundbites. It also points out the limitations of reducing complex topics to easily digestible quotes and the importance of having nuanced discussions on these issues. Additionally, reply B provides a more thoughtful and reasoned response compared to reply A, which uses extreme analogies to make its point.

predict-explain,"First off, I am not a parent. Maybe that disqualifies me from making any comments about this matter in the first place. Either way, I am a fairly objective person and I can admit when I am wrong.

I do not buy into the whole argument of 'just because our parents brought us into the world, we owe them our lives.' Whether a child was brought into the world by choice or not, I don't think that being born should impose a debt of respect on the child. 

Furthermore, I think that this respect needs to be earned. I define respect in this context as 'regard for another person's rational ability, trusting that they can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out.'

This is why I think that giving the reason 'because I said so' is a total cop out. If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect. 

Don't get me wrong, I think it is crucial for a child to be told when they are wrong so that they don't grow up into narcissistic asshats. However, I think that they deserve a logical conversation with a parent until one side admits, of his own accord, that he is in the wrong.

If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect.

I think you will find that as a parent, this would be an impossible situation. You say that ""respect needs to be earned"", but isn't this a two way street? Maybe you think the parent who says ""because I said so"" hasn't done enough to earn the child's respect. But has the child done anything to earn respect either? If the parent tried to rationally explain why they're right to the child, how confident are you that the child will understand and ""can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out"". If they can't, then a rational two-way discussion just isn't going to happen.

And if such a discussion can't happen yet, what now? Should the parent and child just ""agree to disagree""? Of course not. I wouldn't frame it as some kind of ""debt"" that arises out of giving birth, but I think its pretty widely acknowledged that parents are responsible for their child's behavior, even before the child is wise enough to understand complicated reasoning. As a third part, I *expect* other parents to keep their children in line, even if their children aren't smart enough to understand why certain behavioral expectations exist.

And similar phenomena happen for all positions of authority. If a police officer is directing traffic, he doesn't have to explain to you the details of what's going on. You have to listen to him anyway. ""Because I said so"" would be a perfectly reasonable thing for him to say when him explaining what's going on in more detail would hold up traffic (especially if you then decide for whatever reason that you disagree). Similarly, there are many employer-employee relationships where ""because I said so"" should be good enough for you. One hopes that there is a good reason behind the requests, but the employee is in no way entitled to a full breakdown of exactly why everything works the way it does, especially when time is of the essence. Its embedded into the nature of these relationships that you follow orders.","In principle, I agree with you that parents do not simply deserve unconditional respect just by virtue of being their parents. But there are several aspects that I'd like to comment on.

First of all, your parents changed your diapers and by the time you're even just 5, they've invested a whole lot of time and money in you. That is enough to deserve some respect and gratitude. That doesn't mean they can't lose it because they do crappy things, but it is worth quite a bit in itself, and it does deserve respect.

In the case of arguments, there's two points that I think are important. First of all, you'll have found that there are many situations in life where ""because I said so"" is something you'll have to submit to if you want to achieve certain goals. Ever had a job? Ever had a boss who told you what to do? Did they always talk you through the reasons for the required actions step by step? It would be nice if they did, because even in a job I'd quite like to know why I'm doing what I'm doing, but they're not required to because they give you money.

If your parents say you can't wear a cap at the table because they said so, then that's fair enough. They're feeding you. You're free to get up and move out and buy your own food, but as long as they're providing for you, they can make rules, even if the rules are stupid and arbitrary and you don't agree with them. I personally don't think that's a very good attitude and I hope I won't be that kind of parent, but I can't really argue with it.

Also, I've had similar conversations with parents because, as I said, I do in principle agree with you, and I'd very much like to be a parent who explains things to their children and encourages them not to take things for granted or as given without questioning them. But I've been told that this just gets tedious sometimes. Maybe you spend 15 hours a day actively dealing with your child. Children ask all the questions and want to do all the things, and if you at some point run out of patience and don't want to explain something for the nth time, I think saying ""because I said so"" is still not ideal, but perfectly understandable. 

With your last statement, I'm not sure which age you have in mind. But people of any age really sometimes suck at logic, and children even more so, so there are arguments that can't be solved this way because no side will admit out of their own accord that they're wrong. And in some cases there isn't even necessarily wrong or right, because it depends on how much you care about certain things. You can't drag arguments out forever. You need to get on with your life at some point.",A,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a more structured argument, addressing the concept of respect as a two-way street and the responsibilities of parents in guiding their children's behavior. It also draws parallels to other authority relationships, like employer-employee dynamics, to illustrate the necessity of following orders even without a full breakdown of reasoning.

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the practical aspects of parenting and the challenges parents face in explaining every decision to their children. While it brings up valid points about the investments parents make in their children and the need for respect in return, it does not directly challenge the original poster's perspective on earning respect through rational communication.

Therefore, reply A's logical reasoning and counterarguments make it more likely to prompt the original poster to reconsider their views on parental respect and communication."
predict-explain,"So neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument.
All modern economic transactions involving physical items (no stocks, capital, etc.) can be simplified down to a trade of money for labor. Yes, you can buy an item off the shelf at someplace like Target, but what you're really buying is the labor involved in making that item, the item being the end result of it. In other words, it is impossible to buy a physical item that is not shaped and made valuable by labor. In this sense, what you do when you walk to a pizzaria and buy a pizza is *directly* contract the labor of the pizza maker in exchange for money (as opposed to indirect contracting through a store, e.g. DiGornios). Because of this, businesses should have the right to refuse to labor for any particular individual, *for any reason*. If this is NOT the case, and some outside authority can force a person to preform labor they don't wish to preform, that could be seen as a type of slavery (I hate to use the term), because an outside authority is forcing a person, under the threat of force, to labor, even when that person doesn't want to.  
So prove me wrong everyone, help me come to better formulate and understand my own ideas! That's what this sub is about, after all.
Please excuse the weird grammar and sentence structure, I just woke up","""...forcing a person, under the threat of force, to labor, even when that person doesn't want to.""

This type of thinking, which can also be used to call taxation theft, only makes sense from a hyper-individualistic perspective.

The key to understanding laws like these is to think in terms of ""the public good."" Almost any successful business drives away similar businesses in the area. For example, in a small town, there is likely to be only one hardware-store. So the question becomes, if the population can only support one hardware-store, is it important that that store be willing to serve all of the members of the community? A business which practices active discrimination in who they are willing to serve actively hurts the public good. It drives people of the group being discriminated against out of the community.

So the question becomes, which liberty is of greater value, a business owners freedom to discriminate or an individuals liberty to procure goods and services? Only in the USA, where our culture is obsessed with individualism, is this a real question.","""It's the cost of doing business"". 

If a business owner doesn't like their clientele, they are more than welcome to simply stop doing business. (Main difference from slavery is that business owners can walk away.) Alternately you can stop doing business with the general public and become a private store/club instead and only serve your members. 

Non-Discrimination laws are no different than being required to accept currency, building handicap accessible buildings/accommodations, or even not being allowed to be open during certain hours. In the areas that have them it's simply part of the environment of doing business in that area. 

What the argument boils down to at an individual level is ""I doan wanna."". (It may help to imagine that said in the voice of a pouty 3 year old to get the full effect. 

On a more macroscopic scale it boils down to whose ""rights, responsibilities, and or privileges are more important"". In the cases alluded to the responsibility of the public shop owner is to serve the public. If they posted that they didn't do certain designs (like a confederate flag or a swastika or a burning cross, or effigies of presidents for example) and then refused to do that design, they would still be serving the public and not compromising whatever artistic/workmanship integrity they have. That's fine. 

But to arbitrarily refuse service to certain members of the public is not. 

Even without legal rationale... if you open your business, skills and talents for hire in a community... then you need to accept the business of all of the community. Not just the parts that you like. Because if we allow businesses to do that as a community, it tears apart the community. 

This isn't to say that you can't have standards such as a dress code which theoretically anybody can meet, or income requirement etc. But those aren't based on who somebody is. Just what they happen to have at the moment.",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more detailed and logical argument for why non-discrimination laws are necessary in the context of businesses serving the public. It addresses the original poster's concerns about forced labor by highlighting the difference between business owners being able to choose their clientele and the ability to walk away from their business if they do not want to serve certain individuals. Reply B also provides examples of other regulations that businesses must adhere to, such as building handicap accessible buildings, to illustrate that non-discrimination laws are just part of the environment of doing business in a community. Additionally, Reply B emphasizes the importance of businesses serving the entire community to maintain social cohesion, which may resonate with the original poster's concerns about individual rights versus the public good. Overall, Reply B presents a stronger argument that is more likely to challenge the original poster's perspective."
predict-explain,"The implementation of **Judicial Review** from the *Marbury v. Madison* case from the precedent of the **Judiciary Act of 1789** allows for the Supreme court to be to judge over the legislative branch and executive branch of government. 

Furthermore, *Fletcher v. Peck* allows for the overturing of state laws in the Supreme Court, which changed the balance of state versus federal government power in favor of the federal government.

In *McCulloch v. Maryland*, the supreme Court cited the **""necessary and proper""** or **elastic clause** in the constitution to implement laws not explicitly stated in the text. (In this case being the Second Bank of the United States and the legality of a state entity taxing the federal bank.)

*Cohens v. Virginia* allowes for the Supreme Court to superceede state bank's ruling on criminal charges.

Finally, although some may argue that the court is checked by the circumstances by which Justices reach the position- recommendation by the president and approval by the senate, but once inside the court, they have life tenure. [Even the impeachment of Justices accused of public drunkeness and insanity have not been sucessfully carried out.](http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Tries_Justice.htm)

#Ultimately, this means that: 

1. The Supreme Court can judge legality of the actions of the Legislative and Executive brantches of government.

2. The Supreme Court rules over the state courts.

3. The Supreme Court can create laws that are ""Necessary and Proper""

4. Criminals otherwise convicted by state courts can be retrialed with the Supreme Court.

5. Life tenure is nearly garenteed as no justice have been impeached in US History.","Wow, where to begin? :/

&gt;The Supreme Court can judge legality of the actions of the Legislative and Executive brantches of government.

Sort of accurate...*sort* of; the Court can judge the *constitutionality* of Congress' and the President's actions. this doesn't mean the Court can just go around issuing opinions on a whim; there has to be an actual case that raises a justiciable question. The case has to work its way up from the lower courts, then SCOTUS has to grant certiorari (which is rare). 

&gt;The Supreme Court rules over the state courts.

Not entirely accurate. Supreme court precedent *is*, indeed, binding on lower and state courts. But again, that precedent has to come from a CASE. SCOTUS can't just call up the Supreme Ct. of Florida one day and be like ""yo, y'all have to treat gay marriages the same as all other marriages because Amendment 14."" Lower courts are also free to distinguish fact patterns that set their cases apart from SCOTUS' precedent. SCOTUS makes binding opinions, it doesn't ""rule over"" anyone. 

&gt;The Supreme Court can create laws that are ""Necessary and Proper""

The Supreme Court doesn't ""make laws."" That's just Government 101. And the Nec. and Proper clause is in Art. I of the Constitution; it's one of *congress'* powers not the Court's. And your reading of *McCulloch* is 100% wrong. That decision established that the N&amp;P clause gives Congress (CONGRESS!) implied powers, that aren't written down specifically in the Constitution. Honestly, this point you've made is wrong on absolutely every level. Not to sound mean, but it is. 

&gt;Criminals otherwise convicted by state courts can be retrialed (sic) with the Supreme Court.

No. The Supreme Court is mainly an appellate court. It *does* have original jurisdiction (Art. III, Section 2 of the Constitution), but not over criminal cases. SCOTUS *can* overturn convictions if they are unconstitutional in some way, but they can't just call up a trial court and say ""fuck your decision, we're 'retrial'-ing that guy."" No. 

&gt;Life tenure is nearly garenteed (sic) as no justice have been impeached in US History.

Wrong. Look up Samuel Chase. Justices *do* serve for live as long as they don't fuck up majorly. Whether or not that's a good thing is another debate entirely, which has raged across history in its own way. 

The amount of power the Court has in relation to the other branches, in the subjective sense of the word, I suppose is still up for debate. The Federal Government is specifically set up in such a way, however, as to use each branch to limit the others. Congress can ultimately overturn a SCOTUS decision with a constitutional amendment, or can circumvent it by re-drafting the legislation in question. 
Either way, your argument is based on a series of pretty big misunderstandings of how SCOTUS and Constitutional Law work. Again, I'm not trying to sound like an elitist asshole, this stuff is just largely, glaringly wrong.","The natural objection to your view is that the court can only rule on cases that are brought to them as it severely limits the absolute power they wield in terms of making final decisions on all manner of legal questions.  Points 1, 2, and 4 of yours however, certainly show that the court has quite a lot of formidable power to wield, but considering all of those powers can only be used in reaction to other entities exercizing their own powers first, then being sued for it, followed by multiple appeals, it is hard to view what essentially is a veto power as equal to those they are ruling over.   Add to that the fact that even that veto power is constrained by the majority of justices having to agree how to rule and it's even harder to consider the power they wield to be unrivaled in the country. 

For number 5, you never compared the likelihood of removal from the Supreme Court to the other branches.   In neither of the other branches is it easy or common for an official to be forcibly removed from office as a president has never been removed either and only 20 of over 12,000 congressmen have ever been removed.   Of course they still don't have to face public reelection but since their job does not involve representing the people's will or interests as they see fit anyway, it really makes no difference.  Their job is to apply the laws which have already been written (supposedly) to thay effect. 

The meat of your case seems to be 3 though, in that they can effectively can create laws.  Characterizing the case you sited in support of that notion as the Court creating a law looks to me like an enormous stretch though.  Based on what I read, it seems perhaps more accurate to say that they established Congress' right to act with new powers that were not specifically granted them by the Constitution, but were instead implied.  Taking your characterization 
 for granted though, they still can ""create new laws"" that Congress has sought to use and someone else has fought to prevent them from using.  

**TL;DR** 
All of the unique advantages the Supreme Court has that you list are fundamentally restricted in scope compared to the advantages the other branches have.  The most basic and important power common to both of the other branches is simply the ability to use their powers when they choose to.  That basic ability affords them far more flexibility than the Supreme Court to effect political change.   If Congress collectively wanted to make a law to ban all gun ownership in the US, they could, and the Supreme Court could not do a thing about it unless someone else objected first.",B,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a detailed and thorough explanation of the inaccuracies in the original post, pointing out specific misunderstandings and providing correct information about the role and limitations of the Supreme Court. The tone of Reply A is respectful and informative, focusing on correcting the misconceptions rather than attacking the original poster. This approach is more likely to be persuasive and lead to a change in the original poster's view. 

On the other hand, Reply B also raises valid points, but it lacks the same level of detail and specificity in addressing the inaccuracies in the original post. Additionally, the tone in Reply B seems more confrontational and less focused on providing accurate information, which may make it less likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"I understand that this is a very controversial thing to say.  Perhaps my view comes from the women I am surrounded by, which is quite a small sample size. I look forward to hearing another point of view.

My main points:

1.) Physically.  Men dominate sports and physical events.  I can't think of one sport that women are better than men at, in general, and if there are a few, that's only a few, and men dominate the rest. 

2.) In the work place.  This is the most controversial part.  Women want equal pay, but from what I've seen in my limited 8 years in industry, is that women are not as good as men at their jobs.  My industry is oil refining.  99% of the plant workers are men, why?  I work in the Engineering office.  There are no women engineers, only secretaries, and some of them baffle me at how incompetent they are. (Admittedly our one secretary is excellent at her job, and does far better than I ever could.  But my point here is that a man could do that job just as well.) 

3.) At home.  This is where most of my point lies.  It could just be a gender roles thing, but why am I so much better at everything than my girlfriend?  I'm not saying I'm great, but rather most of the girlfriends I've had are completely incompetent at a lot of things.  Things like building an Ikea cabinet, she can't do it.  Small, mundane challenges like un-stacking and re-stacking a sleeve of solo cups.  We had to do it as part of a challenge, and I was much faster at it.  She couldn't figure out how the gear shifters worked on a newer mountain bike after riding it for 10 minutes.  I had never seen this type before, but figured it out in 10 seconds.  Not because I'm clever, but because it is simple and something I believe should be easy for any adult to figure out. 

These reasons are why I hold this view.  I look forward to being completely flamed for this view, and also for another perspective.  Thanks.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","I think most of this comes down to exposure.  Because you used your girlfriend(s) as an example, I will use mine current girlfriend to answer all of these points.

1) Physically, men are in general more superior to women.  I am about 6'2"" and 195 pounds and my girlfriend is 5'5"" and most likely 105 pounds (heaven forbid she sees this and actually weighs less).  I am significantly stronger than her but she is a much faster runner than me.

2)In the work place, my girlfriend whoops my ass in this category.  We are actually both engineering students and her GPA is better than mine (and mine is pretty good).  She also is a better and harder worker than me.

3)At home, I would say I am most likely better than my girlfriend.  I am incredible at caring for children and while I am not sure if she how good she is at something like this, I can assure I am better.  She is generally a better cook than me but I am better than her at things like cooking and cleaning.

All in all, we are pretty split in terms of things we each are better at and these traits span across various categories.  I have an extreme amount of respect for her which is maybe why I am willing to admit some of the things she is better at.

Sidenote: My ex girlfriend before her was not as good of an employee, not as intelligent, not as athletic, and not as good at any home tasks as me.  I was better than her in pretty much every sense of the word.

But like I initially said, I think it all comes down to exposure.","OK. I'm going to look specifically at your points in turn.

1) **Physical**. Absolutely, men at their peak are stronger and faster than women. But a woman at her peak can be stronger or faster than the vast majority of men; look at [Katrin Tanja Davidsdottir](http://espn.go.com/espnw/athletes-life/article/13337513/katrin-tanja-davidsdottir-plays-mental-game-win-crossfit-games), I'm fairly certain she could take most men on and win. To further expand on your point; so what? So women are on average less strong. I'm not convinced that in the modern developed world this is a huge issue.

2) **Industry**. I really think your experiences have biased you here. [Oil refining is 18% female](http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat18.htm) (actually higher than I expected). This means that there will be default be a higher chance that the 'shining stars' will be male. Some of the issues you've seen are down to culture; we have only recently started to accept women in formerly 'male' lines of work such as engineering, so a lot of women who could perhaps have made excellent engineers would never have thought of it as a career option. As for the women who aren't good at their work- I wonder, do you notice the men who aren't good at their work too?

3) **At home**. This one's awkward. There are a few different possibilities here and, I'll be honest, none of my suggestions make you look good- I hope you don't get too offended. 

* First, I noticed that the issues you mentioned were all practical. You're an engineer- that's your bag. So you notice when your girlfriend isn't good at physical things. But I wonder if you've noticed your own failings? Perhaps she's always silently annoyed that you put your foot in it at social gatherings. Maybe you're not very good at art or design. Are these problems, are you possibly less good at them than she is? **Possibly, yes**.  But this is not something for which you should be blamed. They aren't part of your skill-set, but you can learn.

* Perhaps you're impatient. When you were looking at the gear system you used your previous knowledge and applied it to the situation at hand. There's no parallel for your girlfriend; it's the same as asking someone who's only ever driven an automatic car to move to a manual. It's possible, but they will kangaroo down the road for a while before they get the hang of it. 

I remember that it was only a few years ago that my mum was terrible with computers. She's an intelligent woman, a teacher, but they weren't her thing. Why? Because she was trying to learn from me, my sister or my dad- all of whom would just say ""oh give it here"" when she was struggling. Our impatience meant she didn't learn. She did a 1-week course and came out knowing everything she needed to know because the teacher there has the patience to let her learn.

* Maybe you date stupid or physically inept women. This is possible; I can imagine that if you show this 'women are stupid' belief in the real world, intelligent women may be less likely to want to spend time with you.

--

So what does this mean? my TL;DR is that I think you're focussing on things at which you are good, measuring some women against these, then using this to judge women as a whole. 

We could talk about how [more women than men graduate college.](http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/news/story/2012/feb/21/edu-women-overtake-men-in-earning-degrees-at-all/71196/) I could show you that in the [developing world women make up a growing percentage of new entrepreneurs.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/15/female-entrepreneurship_n_1149393.html)

But I think the most likely argument I can make is about environment. The men you hang out with are engineers. They are likely to be above average intelligence. Depending on where you meet women, they are more likely to be average. A very good friend of mine is an engineer, working for one of the top companies in the world designing airports. I like to think she'd be able to show you a thing or two!",B,A,"I would say Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more thorough and thoughtful response to each of the original poster's points. They address each point individually, provide counterarguments, and offer alternative perspectives. Reply B also challenges the original poster's assumptions and biases in a respectful and constructive manner. Additionally, Reply B provides examples and data to support their points, making their argument more compelling. Overall, Reply B's response is more well-rounded and offers a more nuanced perspective on the original poster's views."
predict-explain,"First of all, the *law* I'm referring to isn't the law of any particular country, just laws in general.

Imagine sitting on the bus when an elderly woman comes in. The rules don't tell you to give up your seat for her, but you do.

This short scenario illustrates that rules and morals are two different things. However, I see more and more people defending actions saying it was ""legal"", and therefore it should be alright. 

The death of Cecil the lion is an (extreme) example: the man who shot him defended himself by declaring that what he did was legal. As the global outrage over his actions showed us, it was however completely immoral.

Another example: bankers. I read in a book that bankers that are considered ""professional"" disregard their own morals as much as possible and instead try to do as much as is legally possible. Immoral bankers and brokers are a core part of why the 2008 crisis was able to happen.

I think this illustrates what happens when people use the law as ""moral compass"": immoral behavior. 

Secondly, I think this is caused by the fact that our law is not our morals themselves but rather these morals applied into (simplified) rules.

Thirdly, I think it's impossible to enforce socially appropriate behavior like giving up your bus seat. This follows from my second viewpoint: because rules are simplified results of our morals, they can never cover every aspect of our lives, therefore leaving gaps for bus travellers and dentists and bankers to exploit.

**I think it's up to us to be aware of this and never use the law as a moral compass. Please, change my view.**

If everyone had a 100% agreeable and reliable moral compass, and always acted in accordance with it with no exception, we wouldn't need laws in the first place. 

For example, laws are extremely good as moral compasses for psychopaths who completely lack a moral compass of their own. For a less extreme example, if your moral compass somehow allows you to drive drunk, I think most of us would agree that you should use the law as a moral compass instead.","People who use the defense that what they do is legal are not usually arguing sincerely that what they do is ""right"" from a moral perspective EDIT: because it is legal. Rather, either they don't consider their action immoral in the first place or don't care whether their actions were moral or not. 

The principle they're using as a shield is not the idea that the law is always morally right. Very few adults believe that ""moral"" is identical with ""legal."" However, most people agree that there is a general moral principle that you should follow laws, as laws are usually in place for the good of society. If no one followed any laws, we'd be pretty badly off. So when someone says that the immoral action they took was legal, we shouldn't read it as thinking laws define morality. Instead, we should view laws as an additional moral constraint we place on ourselves to avoid violence and chaos.",B,A,"I would say that reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more nuanced perspective on the relationship between laws and morals. It acknowledges that most people do not equate legality with morality, but rather see laws as a general moral constraint that helps maintain order in society. By emphasizing the importance of following laws for the greater good of society, reply B offers a more practical and realistic argument for why laws should be considered in moral decision-making.

In contrast, reply A focuses more on the idea that laws are needed for individuals who lack a moral compass, such as psychopaths. While this is a valid point, it does not directly address the original poster's concerns about the potential pitfalls of using the law as a moral compass. Reply B's emphasis on the societal benefits of following laws is more likely to resonate with the original poster and encourage them to reconsider their view on the issue."
predict-explain,"* As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.  
* Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic.
* Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. 
* I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the ""warm glow"" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. 
* Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture. Because of climate change, and the overuse of farmlands we may reach that point in the near future.

The government should therefore mirror all its peoples' interests. The group for chronically ill does exist, so is it not fair that they at least receive some recognition in government? If people have an interest in having government-subsidized chronic disease healthcare then the government should at least somewhat represent those people.

When one observes the art and literature left behind from the Black Death, one can see that the people were suffering. Grotesque images of the infected as well as hysteria over what caused the disease ran rampant. The misery of the general public could not be understated, as a force outside their control killed their loved ones without discretion. If such a kind of suffering was to happen, and people knew exactly who was to blame, is it not reasonable to conclude that deaths of chronically ill which affected people would cause the affected to conduct civil unrest?

The argument that GDP will increase is somewhat flawed by itself. The government has actually produced something known as a stimulus check to boost consumer spending in times of recession. Taxdollars which go through the government would still increase the country's GDP because the government still spends money on subsidizing chronic medication. If the proposed system of removing government funding was introduced, then that same money would instead go directly to charities and thereby go to health expenditure. The GDP would remain the same because the government no longer is allowed to tax for chronic illness in the proposed system. The government would still keep the same amount of usable revenue because of an equal decrease in expenditures and an equal decrease in revenue.

In addition to this, chronic illness can range from ~~mile~~ mild to immediate death upon removal of medication. Those people who have chronic asthma aren't really burdening society, but their malady can still be classified as chronic. How does one draw the line between that and something more severe, like crohn's disease? Some people who would otherwise be happily be living would be killed in the name of euthanization. If the government was to apply this same principle to other minority groups, the government might as well kill all seniors over 80 years of age. Obviously, they were suffering from old age, right? 80 years is definitely the right cutoff age and is definitely not an arbitrarily drawn number, right?","Well how far into spending money should we take this whole thing? Should we not spend money researching vaccines and coming up with any sort of cure? Because if you necessitate the treatment of diseases or chronic illness to the old and not the young, it kind of undermines the whole point of making an equitable and healthy society anyway.

Here's some perspective: I was born with a terrible amount of allergies. I was a kid who missed plenty of school days and even became hospitalized over the respiratory infections as a result of my allergies. After many attempts at finding the cause, eliminating the allergen, doctors found an effective treatment for me.

Now, by your logic, one of those times I was in the hospital, it would have been wise to just give up. The cause of my illness and the severity to which it affected my life couldn't be easily identified. But luckily, science and medicine kept steadily chugging along and they were able to identify the source of my condition (a rare and newly discovered thing) which has led to me living a full and vibrant life. 

Rethink what you believe you really *know* in this viewpoint and you may realize that a lot of your key components are conditional and change on a case by case basis.",B,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a personal anecdote that directly challenges the original poster's argument about the value of treating chronic illness in children. By sharing their own experience with chronic illness and how medical advancements have greatly improved their quality of life, reply B effectively highlights the potential benefits of investing in treatment and research for chronic illnesses. This personal story adds a human element to the discussion and makes a strong case for the value of healthcare interventions, even in cases where the outcome may seem uncertain. Reply B also challenges the original poster to rethink their assumptions and consider the individual circumstances and potential for progress in treating chronic illnesses.

predict-explain,"First of all, I wouldn't do this personally because I don't mind walking. I don't even look for close parking spots. This discussion is purely hypothetical looking at the issue from an objective point of view. This post was inspired by a question I posted to /r/legaladvice and was told that it's a douche move. I didn't feel it was appropriate to discuss the douchiness of it there so I decided to make this post.

You go into a parking lot and are trying to find a place to park. There's one 15 spots away from the door and then there's one that's 3 spots away from the door. One of them is meant for expectant mothers but there is no punishment for parking there if you are not an expectant mother which makes the two spots equivalent in everything expect for distance from the door. Objectively, it's better to choose the closer one.

predict-explain,"I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my friends or the people who have gone through that with family or people in general.


As I was walking with my date (M) through town, a group of college students started laughing at us for holding hands. As we were walking by, I kept thinking of all the ways I could get them to stop because if they were to laugh at us, who else are they gonna make feel humiliated or disgusting. I felt like a pet. Some play toy. And that my life was humorous to other people.


I can't say that there would be anything to say or do to make them realize that it's normal to appeal to the same sex. I'm ALL FOR education. I believe education makes the world go around and it's so perfect to learn abd understand new things about the world AND be open minded to everything. 


However, when I see a group of people act ignorantly, I can't help but clench my fist and think about raising hell in their life. The people they are are the kind that take pleasure in hurting people. Why? Because they want to do it for themselves. They can only think about themselves and that they're more perfect than everyone else.


I sure as hell am not perfect. I resort to violence when it comes down to this topic. But when I hear or see ignorance made to hurt others, like this (https://youtu.be/1df_i26wh-w). I can't help but feel like this ignorance needs to be dealt with a punch in the face. Nobody deserves what I got. And nobody deserves the ignorance others recieve.


Ignorance stems from close mindedness, which is something in this world we don't need. If we were all close minded, we wouldn't have advanced as far as we have. Do we really need more of it in this world? Is it necessary for our survival? I believe so to the extent that when there is an absolutely close minded person,there is an equally absolutely open minded person (the bell curve).


So to deal with these people is to punish them with hurt nowhere near the pain they've inflicted onto people, while still sending a message. CMV


Edit: I know violence won't get me anywhere. Are there any other solutions besides time, education and ignorng other people that can remedy the situation more directly?","Warning, anecdotal story ahead:

While it's easy to assume that violence is the easiest answer to a conflict like this, I have a recent personal example (where violence was encouraged) that worked out better bonviolently. 

A fried I'd made at school thought I stole weed from his house. He'd recently discovered the online drug market and was experimenting with all kinds of drugs. He was doing everything from ketamine, to LSD, to opiates. You get the idea. 

So what'd happened was that he couldn't find his stuff as soon as I'd left. The next time I went over, they were having a party. As soon as I'd walked in, this guy (high on percs) starts yelling ""that's the fucker who stole my dabs"" 

I'd heard that he thought that from someone, but I thought it'd be ridiculous for him to accuse me because he should know I'd never do something like that. I found out at that moment that he really thought I'd steal from him. He got up, got in my face, and started screaming at me calling me a theif, a liar, all while there's a good 20 people around staring. 

I stayed calm the entire time. I knew I could resort to violence, but I'd always been taught nonviolence will get you farther. 

I removed myself from the situation, calmly told him I'm sorry that he thinks I'd do something like that, but that I'd leave. 

Banned from the house, I found out later that he'd found what he thought I stole waaay under a couch. When we head back to school in August he wants to talk and apologize to me for everything and clear the air. 

Now I could've punched him in the face one of the multiple times he tried to get physical. I could've screamed back. I could've called him a drug addicted fuck, beat the shit out of him, and still be seen in the right. 

Because I resorted to not using violence, and gave it time rather than resorting to getting physical, I may have one less burnt bridge. 

Whether or not he's a friend worth aging is another topic, but I feel this story sets up a good example for why nonviolence is a more desirable route.","But what happens when you lose your majority?  When people teach others via violence, the people they teach sometimes learn the intended message and other times learn that you are an oppressor who needs to be punished.  This is what happened to you, and you'd like to impose that violence on the people who hurt you.  All well and good, until the wheel turns (as it always does) and you find yourself in the minority again.  At that point, they'll be punishing you for your oppression.

Far better to teach the ignorant but allow them to persist in their ignorance if they wish.  They then learn *that* lesson if they won't learn the intended one.  When the wheel turns, they will therefore be less likely to act violently towards you.",A,A,I would say that reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a broader perspective on the consequences of resorting to violence and emphasizes the importance of teaching others without using violence. It also highlights the potential negative outcomes of using violence as a means of teaching a lesson. This approach encourages the original poster to consider the long-term implications of their actions and the importance of promoting understanding and tolerance.
predict-explain,"Im probably going to ramble on and such so i will make my point clear from the way i see it. Also my rhetoric is not going to be nice because its sort of half a rant too. I guess this is directed at a sort of liberal/progressive crowd, but can apply to right wing people too.

Ever since atheism and anti-theism movement sprung up on reddit we have been bashing it. Some of those reasons was correct. I believe atheists used too much rhetoric such as ""free thinker"", ""skeptic"", ""reason"" and ""logic"" to push their agenda. And we used to (USED TO) have neckbeards spewing some obnoxious shit. And i agree they come off as cringy. But in general, mockery of religion is fun, really fun and FAIR! We laugh at bullshit ideas all the time.

""im an atheist but please be tolerant, let them believe"" or ""People believe different things"" or something similar.

-We have such an agenda of tolerating christians because in the west because the majority is still christian, this also influences ""tolerant atheists"" subconsciously

-We tolerate Islam because ""that is the religion those people in them middle east believe in"" so it would make us racist to criticize it. Like i get it Fox news is racist, but i dont have to be racist because i critizice Islam. Its like the people who try to tolerate Islam somehow think its racist to criticize it, failing to see that there is a diverse spectrum of people who believe in Islam and not just middle eastern people. Calling people racist for critizicing Islam is such a high level of mental gymnastics that i cant even. 

-We cant critizice Jews because that would make us literally Hitler. (I actually understand this one though)

-Mormons are made fun of, but mostly they get the same treatment as christians ""let people believe what they believe"".

-We dont respect the views of other-kin, astrologists, parapsychologists, flat earthers etc.

Because?

They are not a majority, nor taught to us before we could write. That is what i think most people choose to ignore. We dont have people spewing tolerance of religion because we have some genuine need to spare someones feelings. Its because christianity is popular, based on faslehood and people feel like their beliefs are under attack.

When was the last time you saw someone going out of their way to defend a person who claimed to be a wolf? Oh, wait they get laughed at and mocked universally. Guy claims to believe hes literally drinking the blood of christ? Someone mocks him and gets labeled a fedora neckbeard.

Like seriously if someone tells you they believe in unicorns you can probably laugh in their face like ""HAHAHA, you believe that?"" and no one would bat an eye. However, have long debates where you try to go into detail of the problems surrounding religion and trying to debunk it? Richard Dawkins and speakers like him get called intolerant. As if a desire to uphold truth is somehow wrong because people get their little feelings hurt.

The way i see it religion is as fake as astrology or unicorns. But there is no one defending the latter. Religion is bullshit with good PR. I would prefer to keep laughing at people who think they are wolfs, but with a world where no one is trying to pretend like religion needs some sort of handicap from society to not ""hurt precious feelings"". I should be able to find religion absurd without being labeled ""Euphoric"" or ""fedora wearing neckbeard"". 

I wish we could call out bad ideas no matter how many people believed in it. I want eqaulity when it comes to mocking things. The way i see it now religion has some sort of taboo of criticism that is protecting it. The way i want our society to change its view is  for people to watch all three videos  below and laugh. Just for the sake of equality. Sincerely, i live in Norway so i recieve minimal damage from religion. I just wish religion did not have to have some protective shield and having it be taboo to criticize it because they will cry the loudest when mocked.

People mocking stupid beliefs:

-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtH7l-dhHZQ [1]

-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlMiKrwCRQ0 [2]

-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea6w3zp-dYY [3]

Penn Jillette: Why Tolerance Is Condescending

-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpNRw7snmGM [4]

What would change my mind is either:

-A huge amount of people going out of their way to prevent people from critizicing bullshit ideas such as Astrology, para-psychology etc. (people can believe what they want, tolerance, does not hurt you)

-A huge appeal to mock christianity from its own communities.

-Some source proving society not having a total hypocritical view of what bullshit ideas we are aloud to mock and not

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","Religion is unique from the examples you listed (other-kin, astrologists, parapsychologists, flat earthers etc.) in that, at a basic level, it deals with spiritual, non-physical elements that science cannot explore. The ideologies you list are entirely and easily debunkable by modern science.

The idea that there's powers that cannot be observed be humans isn't scientific, and can't be proven or disproven, so it's really up to you if you want to believe it. If you think it's ridiculous to believe in something you can't prove, hey, I understand. But either way, the fringe ideologies you mention *can* be proven wrong, so it's far more nonsensical to believe in those than it is to believe in religion. Thus, it's reasonable for there to be more tolerance for religion than for ideologies that can be factually proven wrong.

And while I do understand that religion is far more than just a belief system in greater spiritual powers and actually have positive and negative affects on society, I'd argue that the negative criticisms toward those negative affects have existed. Yes, it's appropriate to criticize Islamic extremists who wish to cause undue harm, but it's inappropriate to extrapolate that group to the whole of the Islamic faith (as many are want to do). It's very easy, when we're talking about Reddit/society in general, to mix up these two actions, but both of these happen.","My only thought here would be ""why?"" What is the benefit. What is gained? If someone is directly or indirectly harming another person: yes. Those ideas should be shot down. Mocked. Removed. But what if I believe that God started the universe. Science cannot say how the universe started. It simply can't. The Big Bang theory does a fantastic job of telling us what happened RIGHT AFTER the universe was formed. But nothing during or before. 

So, my belief that a god propogated the event that forms the universe does nothing to color the way I see science or treat people. Is there any great benefit of mocking me? Is there any real negative to me dreaming about a life after death? 

Assuming I don't do any of the things that would normally make me wrong (sacrifice my children, not allow gay marriage, refuse to do anything about climate change, etc) then what's the point? I mock belief systems privately or amongst friends all the time. But I don't generalize that to the world en masse. 

I get where you are coming from. But I just don't see ""religion"" as the issue. I see douchbaggery as the issue.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a clear distinction between religion and other fringe ideologies by highlighting the spiritual and non-physical elements that religion deals with, which cannot be explored or debunked by science. This argument suggests that it is more reasonable to be tolerant of beliefs that cannot be proven or disproven, compared to ideologies that can be factually proven wrong.

Additionally, Reply A acknowledges the positive and negative effects of religion on society and emphasizes the importance of criticizing harmful actions without generalizing an entire faith based on the actions of a few extremists. This nuanced approach to the discussion shows a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding religion and belief systems.

Overall, Reply A presents a more thoughtful and nuanced perspective on the topic, which may resonate with the original poster and potentially lead to a shift in their views."
predict-explain,"Variable tax, or at least they way the US does it, is poorly done, inasmuch as it often discourages extra labour from people who may very well need the extra cash in the form of extra taxation. I know that personally, my paychecks are taxed between 25 and 30%, depending on overtime and the like, and it makes it feel so much more that instead of extra cash in my pocket, for going above the 40 hour work week standard, it's cash in the government's pocket.

Of course, this might also be influenced by my somewhat libertarian leanings, in that I consider taxation in general an... unnecessary evil. It's a fact of life I'll admit, but I don't think that it should be. Ultimately though, this post is concerned with the justification of a variable tax rate, inasmuch as how there is a justification for the government to take a larger percentage of your money because you earn more.","&gt; inasmuch as how there is a justification for the government to take a larger percentage of your money because you earn more

This is a common misunderstanding of how marginal tax rates work.  If you make more money, the tax rate only changes on money made above the threshold.  This is an important distinction.

For example, in the US you pay 10% on earning up to $9,075.  Then you pay 15% tax on money made **between** $9,076 and $36,900.

So, someone who makes $10,000 doesn't pay a 15% tax rate.  There actual tax is 

* 10% on $9,075 = $907.50
* 15% on $925 = $138.75

For a total tax burden of 1046.25 or an effective tax rate of 10.46%","As a place to begin, I want to make sure we're discussing the same system here.  A graduated (or progressive) tax system does **not** punish you for earning more.

A simplistic variable system would look like -

- For the first $0 - $9,999 of income - Tax Rate = 0%
- For the income between $10,000 - $29,999 - Tax Rate = 10%
- For the income between $30,000 - $74,999 - Tax Rate = 20%
- For the income greater than $75,000 - Tax Rate = 35%

Keep in mind that if you make $15,000 in a year you aren't taxed 10% on the whole amount ($1,500) but rather 0% on the first $9,999 and then 10% on the remaining $5001 (for $500.10) so the resulting total tax paid in this example is $500.10

As you scale up the government does take more money... but your net income (after tax) *is also increasing*.  

As for why increased earners should pay more % tax - because they can actually sustain the loss.  All humans have the same basic requirements for life (ie Food, Clothing, Shelter) plus additional requirements (Transportation, Entertainment, Education etc.) that need to be met in some fashion.  While it is true that the rich tend to have larger expenses, a simple thought exercise leads to the conclusion that (unless your rich person is insanely overspending) as their income grows the total % of their income devoted to ""necessities"" as opposed to ""luxuries"" declines.  

By that logic, asking the higher income people to carry more of the burden makes sense - the people who are most able to sustain the loss are the ones taking the loss, while the people who are least able to sustain take the least loss.",A,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a clear explanation of how a progressive tax system works and addresses the misconception that earning more money results in higher taxes on all income. It also provides a logical argument for why higher-income earners should pay a higher percentage of taxes based on their ability to sustain the loss. Overall, reply B offers a more comprehensive and convincing response to the original poster's concerns about variable tax rates."
predict-explain,"This is a view I've read about from various pop psychology sources, and it has become conventional wisdom. I believe it contains some truth. Can you convince me it merely reflects the fact that every person has pretty much every trait in them in some form, so if someone says ""I hate X"" they're bound to have some of X in their personality.

An important distinction: I'm talking about ""hate"" that people regularly bring up, like a person who's known for having a hate or dislike of something in particular (something non-trivial, not broccoli or crap movies): **Things that people hate which they think about regularly.**

When people say they hate homosexuals, odds are pretty high they have closeted homosexual desires. This has become a running joke among gay acceptance (i.e. decent) people.

When people say they hate intolerance, you'll often find they're very intolerant of views that strike them as incorrect or un-PC.

Now, take something horrendously evil like pederasty/paedophilia. One of the most heinous, evil, horrible acts possible. Most people I know, however, when asked what they hate in people, don't really mention acts like that. They mention less horrifically evil things: I hate bullies, I hate hypocrisy, I hate rudeness. 

We may want to kill a convicted paedophile with our bare hands, but during our day to day lives we don't think about them often or say we ""hate"" them--we save our long-term hatreds for less evil things. (This may simply be because (say) pedos are so rare and don't show up in our lives very often, or, because people don't hate that which isn't in their own psychological repertoire, or a mixture of both.)

When I say ""I hate religious extremists"", I don't have to be religious to say it, but the underlying trait I hate may be closed-mindedness, which I may hate in myself and which I am afraid of exhibiting. I am 100% convinced I do not have a closed mind, but I cannot easily prove it. Do diehard atheists disprove the idea that what we hate most we hate in ourselves? I also hate animal cruelty, and I've never hurt an animal (knowingly) in my life and have absolutely zero secret or repressed desire to do so. But then again I don't really think about animal cruelty very often, but I do think about other things I hate: petty-mindedness, mean-spiritedness, etc.

Is it all just pop psych bs? I would like a good argument against the idea that our common/over-time objects of hate--particularly a character trait in other people--does not necessarily reflect a hatred of those traits in yourself and a fear that you will express them.

Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","People project their appearance and their personalities in everyday interaction, but can hide their past and their proclivities if need be.

We do not worry about hating pedophiles in everyday life because we don't meet someone and think, ""Ted is totally a pedophile, let's hate on him"". We do think ""Ted is super rude, let's hate him"". So the things we worry about hating in everyday life are the things we interact with the most. My aunt who works as a librarian at a federal prison has told me that she won't look up the crimes of the inmates who volunteer at the library, because she looked up one guy who she really liked and learned that he was in for murdering two women. That information absolutely affected her interaction with this man, because she thought he was a kind and helpful guy prior to knowing this. She has the potential to know the worst about the people she interacts with, something that the everyday person does not, and chooses not to do so because it is too emotionally draining. 

I also don't believe white supremacists are afraid that they are secretly black.

Do we hate the same qualities in other people that we hate in ourselves? Yes, obviously. But I can hate rude people, and hate myself when I am rude, but not consider myself a rude person. I'm just more acutely aware of those moments that I am rude and I think about them more negatively, because it is a quality that I don't like in people. I don't go into moments of introspection when I'm being funny, or kind, or conscientious, or any of the million personality traits that I like about myself and others, even if that is how I act most of the time. I worry about the moments where I thought I was being rude because those are the moments I want to fix now and prevent in the future. I always sincerely apologize in these moments and it often negates my moment of rudeness. A rude person would not apologize or would not apologize sincerely. If you hate an act that you do, you will often hate the person who exemplifies and revels in that act. That doesn't mean that you have that ""trait"" it is just an act you do sometimes because you are human. 

Then there are the primary traits that we hate in ourselves but do not hate in others. I don't consider myself a rude person (although I will do something rude every once in a while), but I would say that I am an extremely anxious person. It's the personality characteristic that I hate most about myself, but I have tons of friends with anxiety and I love them more for it because we find common ground in our anxiety. I'd actually argue that a lot of religions are founded around hating traits about yourself and finding a common group that hates those things about them too. 

Finally there are just personalities that are completely discordant. I am a really really bad liar. That does not mean that I don't lie but I don't do it very often and it is for small things that I often to confess to immediately after telling. So I don't consider ""liar"" to be part of my personality at all, but if you look at the people who I have most actively and violently disliked in my life, they all share the common trait of being a compulsive liar. I dislike them more than rude people, which is an attribute I exhibit far more often (and some of my best friends are rude!). It is the complete difference in our personalities that makes it impossible for us to get along. Lies make me uncomfortable as it is hard for me to keep them and they are hard for me to follow. These people would rather live a life that is perceived to be more interesting while I just want someone who will be honest to me. So when I am around them I am immediately uncomfortable and I often unravel their lies in my attempt to get more comfortable. I don't call them out or say they are a liar, I just ask questions about things that confuse me in their back story because it changes the way that I assume the world works (something small like, ""I've been taking the subway 20 extra minutes all this time when there is a good spice shop at this stop?"" And there actually was no spice shop, she just bought it at Whole Foods and didn't think I cooked. WHY ARE YOU LYING ABOUT PAPRIKA!?!?!?!? WHAT IS THE POINT!?!?!). Sorry, I got sidetracked by a fictional story about paprika. Anyway, so either I'm always uncomfortable around them, which I hate, or they are always uncomfortable around me because they cannot help but lie and are always waiting for me to call them out on it.","This screams of pseudoscience to me. 

Confirmation bias seems rampant with it. There is twisting of language/understanding of traits that are obvious exemptions to this proposed principle of psychology. 

Where is the hard evidence? Where are the experiments? This is all just sounding like mumbo jumbo guru principles that sound cool in theory; therefore it must be true.

I could also just list several examples that I would find to be complete exceptions to this rule, but a large part of that is just as unprovable as the rule itself.",B,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a detailed explanation of how people may hate certain traits in others that they also dislike in themselves, but it does not necessarily mean they possess those traits. The response also includes personal anecdotes and examples to illustrate the point, making it more relatable and understandable.

predict-explain,"I used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have lived/currently live there, I could not be more dead set against ever moving there. In fact, I have come to despise that place. As a quick note about the perspective I have: I'm a 3rd-year law student. I grew up in South FL, and currently live in Boston, MA. I'm not a stranger to life in a northeastern American city; maybe city life in general is not for me, although I do like Boston *much* better than New York. 

First, it's filthy. There is trash *everywhere*, the water is polluted, and the air simply does not smell clean. Being an old Northeastern city, it's filled with old buildings, many of which are in varying degrees of disrepair. It's just generally a dirty, sad place for me to be. 

It's also crowded. NYC has ~8.5 million people crammed into around 300 square miles. To walk anywhere, you must wade through a sea of drab, disheveled humanity. The public transit is packed. Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I've ever had.   

The cost of living is exorbitant, as everyone already knows. Rent alone takes up most of my friends' paychecks, and their places aren't even that nice or spacious. New Yorkers seem like they pay through the nose for a standard of living that ain't that great.

Then there's the climate. The winters are frigid and soul-crushing, complete with biting wind and extended periods of low sunlight or darkness. The summers are sweltering, and the heat only exacerbates the ever-present smell of rotting garbage. Plus, central air is apparently only for the wealthy northeasterners, because it is conspicuously scarce in most homes/apartments I've visited. 

I can't understand the allure of that city. The wealthy live comfortable lives while most everyone else pays through the nose to live wretchedly. People get an inexplicable sense of self-importance and accomplishment simply by moving there and living there for a bit, regardless of what they're doing. Maybe I'd feel accomplished too, if I paid $800/month to live in a cardboard box and resisted the temptation to commit suicide by antagonizing the psychotic, fascist police to which NYC is a home. 

TL;DR NYC is a crowded, dirty, dismal place and I cannot ever picture myself being happy there. CMV. 


Edit: I'm well aware of the shitty aspects of Boston life; to me, NYC's bads are more...well, *bad* than Boston's, that's my point. Also, inb4 ""hurr Florida has bad things about it too."" I definitely know that's true!

Edit 2: FOLKS, this post isn't about ""Boston &gt; NYC""; I'm well aware that there are bad parts about Boston too. Pointing out bad shit about other cities doesn't help make the case for NY. 

Edit 3: For everyone who keeps bitching at me about the delta I gave to u/whattodo-whattodo - READ THE FUCKING RULES. Quoting rule 4's explanation of delta: ""Please note that a delta is not a sign of 'defeat', *it is just a token of appreciation towards a user who helped tweak or reshape your opinion*. A delta =/= end of discussion"" (emphasis added). I've gotten so many replies to the effect of ""hurr, you're a law student and you gave up dat easy?"" Those people can choke on a phallus; I'm just giving credit where it's due, per the rules.

But 8.5 million do. And just going by the costs of housing, millions more would love to but can't. Are all those people wrong?

Most of the negatives you're listing are byproducts of size. Whenever you get this kind of density you're going to get crowds, traffic, and problems with dirt and trash. What you're missing is the upside of that kind of density.

Let's say you've got something you like that only 1 in 1,000 people are into. Maybe it's a particular kind of cuisine, maybe it's a niche hobby, maybe it's an oddball sport, maybe it's a political outlook or cause you care about.

In a city of 8.5 million (and a metro area of nearly 20 million) that's still going to be 850-2,000 people who enjoy the same thing. That's enough to get a well attended meetup going around the hobby. 

Literally anything you might be into, anything you'd ever want to try, any kind of unique experience you can imagine can be found in NYC because the population is there to make it viable. Do you live entertainment like music, bands, comedy, dance, theater, poetry reading? NYC has got all of that ranging from amateur nights to world class performances. Do you like ethnic food? I guarantee you NYC has anything you can name, made by someone from that country. Name whatever you can think of, search for a meetup, and you'll find a bunch of people that love it as much as you do.

A further note, you complain about how crowded the subways are - and they are! - but consider that NYC is one of just a handful of 24 hour train systems *in the world*, as well as one of the largest. It links together 300 square miles and makes it possible for all these disparate people to get together with one another and makes the city feel like a cohesive whole. 

If you come to NYC you *will* find a community to be a part of that'll make it feel like home. There's very few other places can promise that.","*Nearly all* of your supporting ideas for why NYC sucks are byproducts of population.  Basically you're saying everyone wants to live there, so there are many people there and so as a result it's a bad place to live.  *At best* you're only telling half of the story.

I live in NYC and I also love Boston.  Both are great cities, but here are some things that I prefer about NYC.

(1) Entertainment. You can join a club to watch endless Broadway plays and productions for *dirt cheap*.  Some of the finest museums on the planet are here.  

(2) There is business on top of business in NYC.  If you're an entrepreneur, you can't walk down the street without finding some opportunity or another.

(3) If you want to do yoga or martial arts or stuntman training or anything else you can possibly think of, there are more options for each one than anywhere else.  

(4) Restaurants.  New ones spring up *all of the time*.  Also partially motivated by the cost of operation, bad ones die quickly.  It's survival of the fittest.  Do you want a cheeseburger at 5:00 AM?  No problem.  Do you want authentic Nigerian food?  Done.  How about world class, award winning BBQ?  Yep.  

(5) Diversity.  You can meet people from any part of the world, just about everywhere you go.

(6) Dating/Nightlife.  There are more events to visit than there will be nights in your life. There are more people, opportunities and events centered around dating than anywhere else I can think of.

(7) Careers.  NYC costs more, and if you're not doing at least *ok* financially then it hurts.  But assuming that you have a college education, the jobs here pay a lot more than the jobs elsewhere.  

(8)  Politics.  We have and proactive political centers.  Everything from protests to celebrations.

(9) Education.  We have excellent ~~schools~~ *universities*.  


Honestly I could go on forever, but NYC has a lot of great traits.  If a person does not make use of the resources available, then they're probably better off in a place where they don't have to pay as much to live there.

predict-explain,"Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with *most* SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions, but I actually think it does more to silence non-privileged voices than it does to encourage education, empowerment, progress, or harmony.

A college education (or at the very least, the Internet and plenty of time on one's hands) seems to be a standard cost of entry for dialogue with a typical SJW. Dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as: patriarchy, heteronormativity, trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF), cisgendered, gender spectrum, gentrification, respectability politics, privilege, oppression, identity, assimilation, queer, otherkin, institutionalization, marginalization, etc....I could keep going.

These are all terms that I've just pulled directly from SJW Tumblr pages/comments. Some are more easily defined than others, but there are still layers to each concept (such as privilege or oppression) that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time they've been exposed to these ideas.

Honestly, I have a master's, and the first time this language was thrown my way, I felt dumb for not understanding some of it. How might someone who could only afford a high school education feel? I get that they want to use intelligent, specific language to explain some concepts that are difficult to put into words, but how is someone who doesn't have the privilege of a college education, or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts, expected to engage in dialogue that sounds like it's spoken by a women's studies textbook? It can be intimidating, and no one likes to have a conversation that makes them feel stupid. How is this use of privileged language encouraging those who are economically and educationally marginalized to participate?

I don't want to generalize, but from my own experience, a majority of SJWs enjoy doing what they do because they like winning arguments. It's not about empowering and educating. In the face of ignorance, SJWs tend to belittle and insult, rather than educate or allow for a balance dialogue. The attitude is, ""Oh, you're ignorant? Let me make you feel *more* ignorant by insulting you and using words you don't understand.""

Again, I'm in favor of most ideas SJWs tend to champion...transgender rights, #BlackLivesMatter, feminism, etc. I just think they're going about it in a way that turns people off, because they're so concerned with being able to flex their knowledge and with shutting down those who might disagree with their ideas the tiniest bit.

Speaking of which,* ***[downvotes don't change views](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/guidelines#wiki_upvoting.2Fdownvoting)****!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","On the subject of specialized language, couldn't you say the same thing for pretty much *any* specific area of discussion?  For example, American football has dozens of similarly inaccessible words for those who haven't taken the time to look them up.  These words aren't any harder to learn than any other.  It just so happens that some words (and the things they represent) come up less often in everyday conversation, so the average person is less likely to already be familiar with them.  This is not even the slightest bit unique to ""SJW"" words.  

Example: if you asked me what a linebacker was, I would have absolutely no idea what the answer was, besides that it's a position in football.  (And for the record, I'm a 20-something year old male living in North America.)  Yet I don't accuse football of being elitist because I haven't bothered to check what these words mean before trying to talk football with people who have.  As for when there are lots of ""layers to each concept,"" what does this really mean?  These layers exist not because of some SJW conspiracy to keep outsiders out, but because ideas like privilege and marginalization are genuinely complex issues that you can't become an expert on overnight.  

But you can still do some basic research on simple definitions quite easily, and learn the rest as you go along - just as you would with literally any other complex idea.  I don't think that's too much to ask, and it's what education is fundamentally about to begin with.  It seems strange to accuse something of ""doing little to educate"" on the grounds of there being lots of things to learn.","Academia has always been like that. Mind you, a lot of ""SJW's"" are college students, they're used to this style of talk about social issues and mimic it on tumblr. The way it's always been with social activism is that there's a sort of ""ivory tower"" side and a more ""hands on"" side to it. 

The latter organizes youth groups, teaches people about racism on their local school or community center, it organizes things like pride parades and history month celebrations.

The former is deliberately all talk, its efforts go towards identifying and naming the phenomenons that surround the injustice and discussing solutions. 

This is not a new thing at all, take socialism for example, you had the academic elite discussing about concepts with big words and citations to lofty philosophers, there was the side that came in contact with people and riled them up or informed them. Also take how sociology professors talk about microagressions and mental colonization, while black advocacy groups take those ideas and rather than preaching about them go into action to stop them. None of them does more than the other, they need each other to be effective and thorough.

I think there are several problems with how ""SJW's"" are handling activism, but their academic or pseudo-academic approach is not it. Refusing to educate others is regressive and a problem, yes of course, but the fact that advocacy includes complicated concepts and words is a nonissue.",B,B,"I believe that Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a comparison to other specialized areas of discussion, such as American football, to show that the use of specialized language is not unique to ""SJW"" topics. It also emphasizes the importance of doing basic research and learning as you go along when dealing with complex ideas, which is a fundamental aspect of education. 

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the historical context of academia and social activism, highlighting the different approaches taken by academic elites and activists on the ground. While this provides valuable context, it may not directly address the original poster's concerns about the use of privileged language and the potential exclusion of those with less education or resources. 

Overall, Reply A provides a more direct and practical response to the original poster's concerns, making it more likely to change their view."
predict-explain,"This CMV has been done in some form before, but from an outside perspective looking in.  I am open to having my mind change or at least swayed, but this belief is rather ingrained.  

My wife and I are both children of Poor Asian immigrants to this country.  I will reflect on my mother’s story.  She had me very young out of wedlock with no support from my biological father while her parents were stuck in our native country.  When she came to this country she was on government assistance.  With very little support she was able to finish community college, transfer to a four year college majoring in computer science eventually getting a Master’s Degree.  Her story is not unique to the rest of my relatives or the Asian immigrant community.  I don’t need to discuss how my wife and I are doing since we have greatly benefited from our parent’s generation, their hard work and sacrifice.  

I hear the arguments regarding systemic discrimination of blacks in this country.  I’ve read Unequal Childhoods by Annette Laureau regarding kids in disadvantaged environments are less likely to succeed than those in middle to upper class upbringings.  However I don’t completely buy into it.  I’ve seen countless family members and friends go from food stamps to sedans in the burbs, and I attribute that to a culture centered around hard work, sacrifice, and education.  As my mom was going through school, we lived in poorer neighborhoods, and I was raised in neighborhoods with Blacks and Hispanics, sure I’ll throw out the I had black friends card, I still do.   At the time we were on the same level economically, yet culturally we were worlds apart in what was emphasized from a parenting standpoint.  As I grew up I met more successful black kids in undergrad, grad school, work, but most of them came up from middle class upbringings.  They had no problems acting 'white' while I saw my childhood poor black friends get mocked for doing so, therefore I believe its a cultural part of poor black americans which is hindering them from assimilating into middle class america.  That is why I don’t have compassion for the narrative that is pushed in the media for the poor black or hispanic american unable to rise from poverty.  I know this is a strong talking point for the right wing yet I have not read any tangible counter argument to the dispute the Poor Asian immigrant story.  If there are books or articles which provides a cogent counter argument please feel free to share.    

TL:DR – The rationale for why blacks and Hispanics are unsuccessful in the U.S. are bunk because of the success of Asian Immigrants.  

Edit: This is not to say that there isn't racism in society, especially towards Asians.  Colleges definitely try to make it harder for Asians to get admitted despite higher scores, and there is a Bamboo Ceiling in the workplace.  However, I don't believe racism is so pervasive in this country that it can hold an entire demographic in poverty against their will, I believe this is attributed to culture.  

Edit2: I appreciate the dialogue.  One point which I'll concede and am swayed from the dialogue is that racism, more specifically the historic racism perpetrated in the U.S. such as Jim Crow and Slavery created the culture which is present in the poor black community, hindering them from rising from poverty.  But nothing disputes that this culture is reason, and not the present-day racism that is preventing them from achieving in this country.  That is what I have issue against that the media portrays a image of victimization due to current day racism, however, I don't think the type of racism is the cause, maybe past racism, but not the type minorities face today.  If no one has a counter argument against the cultural aspect, shouldn't black culture, the one that glamorizes the baller lifestyle, be the focused of policy makers to change rather than focusing their efforts on social restructuring to accomodate the culture?  

Edit3: At the end of the day, and the dialogue set forth I come away from it with the following:

1) That current poor black culture  is a result of systemic discrimination.  
2) No one has disputed that culture which I have generally claimed is the REASON for the state of poor black americans.  
3) The present day racism and white privilege that exists today is not sufficient enough to either hold a demographic down or lift them up, not as much as the modern day media seem to claim.   
4) I want to beef up on some books and articles cited
5) The IQ debate. hmmm I'm just not going to touch that right now.","I think the blacks rights thing plays a big issue in this. It really hasn't been that long since that period and the racism from that still persist for a period of time after changes in laws.  In part the effects of that and the slavery thing is still ingrained in their culture. 

For the Latino population, many are illegal immigrants, which really affects their earning potential. Then their families also tend to be bigger too which means more money needed to support. Teen pregnancy rates were also higher for them which hinders them too. 

Asians are lucky with not as strong discrimination and oppression.  I know there is racism, but it's not nearly the same as the other two population. It helps us get ahead as we are seen as ""smarter"" or ""hardworking"".","A better explanation is that asians do better because they have higher IQ.

this is also consistent with findings that jews have higher iq, and that jews do well in the US.

It is consistent with findings that blacks and hispanics have low iq, and that they perform worse in the US.

This is also consistent if you compare majority black countries, which are always underdeveloped, to white and or asian countries, which have a mix of level of development. Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singpore and Japan are prosperous nations inhabited by majority asians, who have high iq. 

Blacks also perform poorly in all countries, not only in the US. 

the IQ being relating to intelligence which is related to performance in a modern society is a simple and powerful answer to this question, it fits all data.

the only problem, of course, is that it is politically incorrect, and that political orthodoxy supercedes truth in the US.

which is a shame",B,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This reply acknowledges the historical impact of racism and discrimination on the black community, as well as the challenges faced by Latino populations such as illegal immigration and larger family sizes. By recognizing these systemic issues, it provides a more nuanced explanation for the disparities in success between different racial and ethnic groups. 

On the other hand, Reply B's argument that differences in IQ are the primary factor influencing success in society is reductionist and ignores the complex interplay of historical, cultural, and socioeconomic factors that contribute to disparities in success. Additionally, the assertion that certain racial groups inherently have lower IQ is not only controversial but also lacks empirical evidence to support it. 

Overall, Reply A offers a more thoughtful and comprehensive analysis of the issues at play, making it more likely to sway the original poster's views."
predict-explain,"Edit: YOU HAVE CHANGED MY VIEW. (Only regarding hunting for food) 

This isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a bit sadistic. Hear me out - I'm not here to make a dig at hunters. I don't eat meat myself but I actually believe hunting game as a source of meat is much more ethical than eating mass produced factory farmed animals. Game animals have at least had a natural life without chemicals, genetic engineering and is the ultimate in animal welfare. You can't beat having the life nature dictates. So I'm in conflict with what is actually involved in hunting. 
Lets take an example of a hunting a deer. A healthy meat with a plentiful population to chose from. So you go out into its habitat, learn its habits, track it and then finally you see it. Quietly in its happily eating some food. Minding its own business. Full of life and so majestic in its natural habitat. This stunning beast is a pleasure to see.  I believe many hunters genuinely have a lot of respect for the animals they hunt. But then full of all that respect BOOM! They take its life. Just like that. All that effort to understand it, follow it and watch it they extinguished  in a second.  Cold hard logic can indeed justify why the animal is killed but deep down the pleasure hunters feel when they've killed an animal doesn't make sense to me.","I applaud deer hunters in my area because we have way too many deer. Car/deer interactions are high in my former state. I know. I've hit one. Deer populations are out of wack because we removed alpha predators. There are too many of them and the health of the herd is affected. 

Hunters either kill deer or deer populations grow to the point where they starve to death. Nature doesn't really mess around. 

I would much rather a deer died from a clean bullet wound than from a slow death of starvation or the aftermath of a car strike.","I'm just starting out hunting, and I've taken some small game, but I don't do it just to see something die, and I hope I never do. I do it because I like the food, I like being outdoors, I like knowing my meat was harvested as painlessly as possible, and in the U.S. it helps prevent habitat destruction by both funding conservation and managing populations that have had their natural predators removed by human intrusion and poor hunting practices prior to the current system. I want future generations to see whitetail deer, water fowl, and wild turkeys, and  can help preserve them by hunting responsibly, while getting some free range organic food out of it. 
Edit: I want to add that when I pull the trigger, I feel a mix of emotions. Seeing something die by your own hands is unpleasant, and I don't get a single bit of pleasure for the act of killing. At the same time, the feeling of accomplishment after spending hours scouting and tracking is a huge rush. I know a lot of hunters say a prayer over their kill, and while I am not religious, I do pause to reflect and respect an animal's passing",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more in-depth explanation of the reasons behind hunting, focusing on the ethical aspects such as harvesting meat as painlessly as possible, funding conservation efforts, and managing populations. The user also expresses their mixed emotions and lack of pleasure in the act of killing, showing a level of introspection and respect for the animals they hunt. This perspective may resonate more with the original poster who is conflicted about hunting, as it offers a nuanced understanding of the motivations and considerations involved in hunting."
predict-explain,"First off, this is an exciting new subreddit for me and I love the idea.
However, I can't seem to shake feeling that many of the posts here stem from people's discomfort with their own nonconformity and outlying ideas more than from a thirst for truth.

Additional info: I am currently writing an essay on the phenomenon of 'groupthink' so the theme is ripe in my mind.
I showed this sub to a friend of mine who immediately believes the moral statuses quo of Tumblr, including contradicting ideas, and has always seemed to me to have difficulty breaking social norms and thinking for herself. Her immediate reaction was to dismiss all posts she saw as 'stupid' (that'd be the first page of 'hot' at time of posting). This, no doubt, has influenced my view.

I'd like to highlight again that I am excited to have found this sub and I'll be visiting here often. But I'd like to discuss this idea first.

P.S. I'm so meta I post requests for people to change my view about /r/changemyview on /r/changemyview as a critique of /r/changemyview.

I say unique because usually, the OP has already considered the most common opposing ideas in advance. In fact, people present mainstream views so often that the moderators created Fresh Topic Friday in order to promote more unique and nonconforming posts. Furthermore, even though I think it's much more difficult to give a delta than to earn one, the system rewards earning them. That means that everyone is competing to have the most unique and compelling post, and the OP is competing to keep his or her view from being changed. I'm not sure how important  internet points are to people, but the scoring system is definitely set up to reward individuality and disincentives group think. This in in direct contrast to karma, which is often awarded to people who people already agree with.","this is my experience in this sub: there are many different reasons why people post here. some post to be part of an echo chamber.  some post to defend and strengthen their views.  some are concerned that they are not considering enough perspectives and are looking for alternate views. so my first argument is that you are over-simplifying this sub.

the nature of reddit is present in this sub, what with upvotes, downvotes, etc. but popularity does not equate to deltas.  op decides whether to award a delta. in any case, discussions here typically last as long as the topic continues to get fresh perspectives.  if op doesn't hand out a delta where the popular view is that a delta is earned, or if the discussion devolves into semantics and hair splitting, interest in the discussion wanes.

groupthink depends on the adherence of the accepted opinion as dogma.  challenging these ideas in any real way is out of the question. the entire premise of this sub is to question the views put fourth.

I could be wrong, but groupthink may also be controlled by a fascist regime, which this sub is not.  as far as reddit mods go, r/cmv has mods that seem to prefer the spirit of the law to the letter.  the sub's rules do not seem like they foster groupthink to me.

so, we have a place where ideas are served up for public vivisection.  ideas can freely be challenged and only the op decides whether or not his or her view has been changed.  that seems closer to the socratic method than groupthink.  would you consider the socratic method ""teach me to groupthink""?",A,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a more detailed and nuanced explanation of the different reasons why people post in the subreddit, addressing the complexity of human motivations and behaviors.

Additionally, Reply B raises the analogy to the Socratic method, which is a strong argument in favor of the subreddit's purpose. Overall, Reply B presents a more thorough and compelling case for why the original poster's concerns may not be as valid as initially thought."
predict-explain,"I have been seeing this a lot recently with this lion uproar. Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to abortion. I haven't really followed the lion thing, that was just an example. People do this in all sorts of conversations. 

I find this reasoning completely flawed. Are we only going to care about the most important issue? Before we care/talk about something do we have to make sure there is no issue more important?  Also, the conversation about X is already happening. The issue is out in the open and people are passionate about solving it. This is great and a bit rare. We should roll with it when people want to make positive change instead of making them feel bad for being passionate about the wrong thing.  People have the capacity to care about more than one issue. Humanity as a whole can work together to solve more than one problem at once. Saying something like this you are trying to derail the argument about X  rather than help either argument.

Edit* This is about society's problems and public conversations rather than individual problems.

People are not really mad that we're talking about Cecil's killing in the wake of the deaths of people like Sandra Bland and Samuel Dubose. People are made that we're talking about Cecil's killing **at the expense of** talking about the deaths of people like Sandra Bland and Samuel Dubose.

Nobody's arguing that the lion's death isn't tragic. People are arguing that the lion's death is not so tragic that it's worth completely ignoring yet more examples of not only police brutality but straight-up lies told by the police to cover that brutality up. We want positive change, sure, but it's good to prioritize.

You say that ""people have the capacity to care about more than one issue."" This is true. However, people also only have a finite capacity to care about issues in general. When certain issues are shoved far enough out of the spotlight in favor of - quite frankly - more important ones, these issues stop being cared about enough to actually effect change.

Tl;dr: it's not that we shouldn't care about ""less important"" issues, it's that we have a finite amount of time and space and mental energy to care about issues in general. Therefore, we should apportion appropriately and not give undue attention to an issue which is not as important.","It doesn't take an expert to spot the flaw in that sort of argument. It is an informal fallacy, called ""appeal to worse problems"". There are many reasons why it does not work, you have named several.

However, as with many fallacies, the idea behind it has merit. All problems are not equal. Devoting time, effort, money, etc. to lesser problems at the expense of larger ones is undesirable, all else being equal. What's important is whether one can provide good reasons why one issue should take precedence over another, and to what degree.",B,B,"I believe reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a well-thought-out explanation of why some people may prioritize certain issues over others, emphasizing the finite capacity individuals have to care about multiple issues. It also acknowledges that people can care about more than one issue but suggests that prioritization is important for effecting change. 

On the other hand, reply B focuses on the fallacy of ""appeal to worse problems"" without delving into the specific context of the original post. While it mentions the idea behind the fallacy having merit, it does not address the original poster's argument as directly or comprehensively as reply A does. Therefore, reply A is more likely to persuade the original poster to consider the importance of prioritizing certain issues."
predict-explain,"Socialism and its later potential follow up Communism, are great ideas and in an ideal world would create an utopia, where everyone is truly equal and there is no gap between rich and poor, in fact there are no poor and rich. However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed, that in order for socialism to work, the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia (Where I am from), China and others who attempted at doing this, but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue, which I have with socialism, due to two reasons:

First, people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone, and nothing to them personally. That is the very reason why it later turned into a terrible state like Soviet Union, where there were no true elections anymore, corruption was high and some were “more equal than the others”. Meaning it was not the authoritarian state, which was the cause of the failure of socialism, but people’s inability to follow socialist rules, which led to the failure of the USSR in the 90s, whose system was heavily relied on Oil prices and the economy was otherwise weak. 

Second of all, as mentioned before, in order for Socialism to work, the whole world has to comply with it. If for example say USA will start implementing even minor socialists norms, then other countries like China, where there is no free health care or free anything for that matter, will simply out perfume costly workers of USA and take away their jobs. Which is indeed the case with things like outsourcing and not so quickly growing USA economy. The solution for USA would then be to close itself up and live in a world where there are no imports or exports, this would protect its citizens from fierce external competition, but leave USA lacking behind in progress of all kinds. Examples for this are Venezuela or Columbia. 

All in all, I still think that some elements of socialist systems are useful, like welfare for people who recently lost their jobs, paid mothers leave etc. However this are minor elements, which I think, should otherwise be implemented in fierce Capitalist society, where in order to succeed you cannot rely on gov. support, but 95 % on yourself.

Edit: I hope this is not too long of an explanation.

This why the  phrase ""Workers of the World, Unite!"" exists.

Ultimately, the biggest thing that can be done is to unite the working class. Join unions, negotiate better pay and working conditions for everyone the world over.

Obviously this is better achieved at a country level - but it can be expanded worldwide by those who are doing something in their own country, to (for example) only purchase or conduct businesses with other companies in other countries who are also improving the rights of their workers. Ultimately, everyone should be paid well for reasonable hours *regardless* of their job. And by ""well"" I mean a lot more than lowest earners are currently getting, by ""well"" I mean a wage that allows people to *live* and not work for little return.

This is achievable, and will have a real impact on the entirety of humanity. It will change the economy from that of an exploitative one, to one that promotes good pay for all, and allow us to live our lives, follow our dreams, and work in careers we wish to, instead of being wage slave until we die.

Right now there is a strike on the underground system in London. Instead of people supporting them in improving their work life, and using this as inspiration to improve *their* own work conditions and pay, people are attacking them. Calling them overpaid, greedy etc (when really the people who are doing the attacking and name calling are weak and powerless as they are too afraid to do the same thing - if someone has what you don't have, you should aim to get the same, not take away from what they have. This only makes things worse for everyone, including themselves,  as then being a low paying wage slave is the norm).

EDIT: I rushed writing this so if it doesn't make sense, just ask for clarification :)","The ""argument from human nature"" gets brought up a lot but is surprisingly easy to refute. From all the socialist books I've read, (and I don't know if you've read any), it is never required theoretically that people should become perfect. Instead, socialism as a theory is conceptualised as one which will more perfectly fit human nature as it is. 

Firstly, what is human nature? The first thing we can say about it is that it is very varied. It is just whatever humans do. But humans do a lot of things. 

The central mistake that proponents of the argument from human nature make is a kind of ""begging the question"". They assume that human behaviour in a capitalist system must be the paradigm of human behaviour per se. I think this is demonstrably false, as a moment's reflection will show. 

For the vast majority of time that humans have existed, they were hunter-gatherers, living in fairly small communities or tribes and practising some form or other of primitive communism, ie, sharing the spoils of the hunt. Social structures were also more or less egalitarian, necessarily, because of required co-operation in the hunt. 

If mankind has a species character, it will be informed by being a hunter-gatherer, living in a social group. Other social forms, cities, states, capitalism, consumerism, and so on, are much later, much more recent developments. 

So what we can take from this about human nature? 1. Humans are a social species, they can collaborate and join their labour together for the common good. 2, Humans are creative, and find meaning and dignity in creativity. And you can also, more tentatively, add: 3. Humans are at their best when free to contract the kinds of social relationships and pursue the creative activities they want.

Well this exactly accords with the species character of man described by Marx and, before him, by the philosophers of the Enlightenment. Man is given naturally to free, cooperative, creative labour. 

Now comes the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution transformed the farm worker into a factory worker, a proletariat. Labour became *necessarily* collaborative again. 

Socialism is nothing more, at a basic level, than a theoretical response to these facts about human nature and human creativity, and the facts of limited global resources and labour. If you want to, you can look at it merely as a rational, efficient use of resources and labour, getting rid of unproductive classes, middlemen, profiteers, production of useless commodities, and so on. 

So to sum up, your ""argument from human nature"" is, as usual when this argument is brought up, based on the usual question-begging and is, I'm sorry to say, based on something of a strawman socialism. I recommend that you read up on the topic and you'll see that no serious socialist writer demands or expects perfectibility. 

Your other objection, that socialism, in order to function properly, would require a world-wide system, is more serious and has more force to it.  But that was only ever a long-term goal and it doesn't follow that we can't try to achieve change in our day-to-day lives, and in our own local polities. After all, world-wide changes have been affected before and they will be again. 

I would also briefly say that very few people advocate a Soviet-style system these days. No-one is anxious to recreate the days of Stalin and gulags and show trials. But once you grasp that that was a deviation from the course of socialism proper, (and was recognised as such at the time by perceptive critics), the goals of socialism in the present day become all the more clear.",B,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a detailed and well-reasoned argument against the ""argument from human nature"" that the original poster presented. It delves into the historical context of human nature and how socialism aligns with the natural tendencies of humans to collaborate and be creative. It also addresses the misconception that socialism requires perfection from individuals. Additionally, Reply B acknowledges the challenges of implementing socialism on a global scale but emphasizes the importance of striving for change in day-to-day lives and local communities.

Overall, Reply B provides a more nuanced and comprehensive argument in favor of socialism, addressing the concerns raised by the original poster in a thoughtful and informative manner."
predict-explain,"I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that information triggers victims, and therefore the information ends up at ends. This includes language such as ""Pepper spray can deter attackers of any kind, and therefore it is strongly recommended that ANYBODY carries it with them at all times."" or ""Hot zones for crime include times after dusk and before dawn, so it is advised to travel in groups at this time to deter attackers.""

People rage at this information saying that I should not ask anything of the victim, and that this information is useless. People often use the argument ""We should teach people NOT TO RAPE""

My issue here is that the suppression of this information in lieu of pursuing an idealistic rape-free culture neglects the current standing of our surroundings, and that dangerous people still exist, and will exist for the foreseeable future. I see no harm in telling anyone that safety is important, and that there are very cogent steps to significantly lower your risk of being attacked and/or raped.

The only instance I would excuse my previous statement would be people telling actual victims of rape what they COULD have done. This does nothing to change what happened, and is a slimey thing to do.

Maybe this is just an Anti-SJW rant that I didn't even know I was making, or maybe I have an actual argument here. If I am not clear on this classic argument, I would appreciate some clarity, and am always open to thoughtful and courteous discussion.

Please no flaming, arguing, or fighting. Thank you!

This advice as a way to prevent rape is not practical.  When you give these tips to women as ways to prevent rape, you are giving useful information to half of your population for a situation that is not very common.  (Also, the advice is really obvious.  People are naturally uneasy when alone in the dark.) You are better off presenting the advice to everybody as a way to prevent mugging or other more common crimes.

Rape is overwhelmingly committed by someone the victim knows.  The ""jumping out of the dark"" type rape is rare compared to ""date"" rape.  When people talk about teaching others not to rape, what they mean is ""one should know that having sex with an inebrieted person is wrong; having sex when someone is uncomfortable is wrong, etc.""  Rape cannot be a crime of need, which is why there are no ""teach people not to steal"" campaigns.

You can't give tips on how not to be murdered, you can only teach people to think murder is wrong.  Likewise, in order to prevent rape, you should teach people who have sex to be considerate of their partners' consent.","Here's a different angle: No, anti-victim blaming culture is not suppressing rape prevention information. The common activist is smart enough to tell the difference between blaming the victim and telling people to be careful.

The ""teach men not to rape"" meme/campaign/trend is mainly focused on spreading education of consent in situations involving heavy drinking, drugs, and ambiguous/difficult to read situations.

As several people have already pointed out, rape is not very often a crime involving ambush and assault, at least not in this age.

Even the most toxic activist movements have yet to attempt to shut down women's self defense classes or weapons marketed towards women (unfortunately in some cases, as certain weapons and defense measures are totally ineffective)

There certainly can be a much better method of spreading this and similar messages besides confronting the innocent with accusations (""schrodinger's rapist"" and ""@yesallmen"" spring to mind), however, there have been no notable instances of even the most hardline ""SJWs"" actively suppressing self defense and rape prevention information. More often than not, the messages you're referring to are spread by ignorant young girls, high school teenagers or victims of toxic group dynamics that nobody honestly listens to anyway.

In summation, the only people for whom self defense and rape prevention information is being suppressed are the ones spreading this information in toxic activist communities.",A,A,"I would say reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a logical argument that focuses on the practicality and effectiveness of the information being shared. It points out that the tips given for preventing rape are more applicable to preventing other crimes like mugging, and that rape is often committed by someone known to the victim rather than a stranger jumping out of the dark. 

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on defending the anti-victim blaming culture and argues that rape prevention information is not being suppressed. While it provides some valid points, it doesn't directly address the practicality of the information being shared and how it can be more effectively communicated.

Overall, reply A presents a more coherent and logical argument that addresses the original poster's concerns, making it more likely to change their view."
predict-explain,"As long as I've been alive, I've always poured milk before cereal.  I've done this because I am a textural eater and I hate soggy cereal.  I believe that pouring milk first provides more time to eat fresh cereal.  
It seems though, that most of the world, including 99% of my friends, does it the other way; no one has provided me with an explanation as to why I should do it otherwise.  However, they sure do like to judge the way I like to prepare my cereal.  Please give me a legitimate reason to consider otherwise (besides just your preference for soggy cereal, which I won't even consider given that I don't like soggy cereal).

EDIT: Thanks to all the people that posted replies.  To be honest, I don't know if my view has completely changed, but I definitely recognize the validity of cereal first.  It seems that it is a more efficient to obtain the ""perfect milk to cereal ratio"".  However, I think that is all due to preference and for those that don't really know how much milk or cereal they want.  I guess the best way I can explain my own preference for milk first is similar to soup.  I pour the soup in before adding croutons or something.  I still welcome further discussion, but I will have to sign off for now since I'm at work.

predict-explain,"A lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off.

[Watch the launch video to understand what Amazon Echo is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQn6aFQwBQU) If you don't have the time, this is the pitch:

Amazon Echo is designed around your voice. It's hands-free and always on. With seven microphones and beam-forming technology, Echo can hear you from across the room—even while music is playing. Echo is also an expertly tuned speaker that can fill any room with immersive sound.

Echo connects to Alexa, a cloud-based voice service, to provide information, answer questions, play music, read the news, check sports scores or the weather, and more—instantly. All you have to do is ask.

Essentially, it is an omnipresent Siri that lives in your home and is constantly listening. The device already has 23,058 reviews from testers and it is just hitting the market. Now imagine one of these in everyone's home. I will cover some of the highlights of the launch video as examples in my argument.

---

**Reason 1: Laziness**

A lot of technology today encourages laziness. However, this takes it to a whole new level.

Example: ""Alexa, add waffles to my shopping list."" Now we don't even need to jot things down or even type them into our smart phones at the very least.

Example: 'Alexa can provide news!' Instead of reading the newspaper or watching the news we can listen to a mono-tone robot recite world events.

Example: ""Alexa, what is the chance of rain?"" The woman is literally standing next to the door when she asks this question. However, she would rather receive the weather from her nifty new gadget than to actually look outside or watch a weather report.

---

**Reason 2: Reliance on Technology**

Most of us can admit that we are uncomfortably dependent on our smart phones. However, what if our smart phone was never in our pocket? What if it was always plugged in and tempting us? This is essentially Amazon Echo. The narrator even proclaims that Echo will, ""Become a part of the family!""

Example: ""The echo is a tool that we use to keep our household functioning."" This is a quote from a mother as she dresses her daughter. I am aware that these are commercially invented situations being reenacted by paid actors. However, I feel as though they are fairly accurate depictions of how people will use this technology and how they will respond to it. Clearly, there are many issues with one piece of technology keeping a household together.

Example: ""The prime re-ordering is when you can ask Alexa to order something you've already ordered through your prime account."" Now we can shop by shouting a phrase at a robot! No need to go out.

I think laziness coupled with reliance on technology have been the most harmful qualities that todays youth (myself included) suffer from. We find it difficult to go out and make plans. We find it difficult to socialize. We find it difficult to talk on the phone. In a world full of constant updates and fast information, why should we access things in any other way? We want things instantaneously and at our discretion.

---

**Reason 3: Invasion of Privacy**

Major corporations will do anything to learn more about consumers and what they want. Echo allows consumers to order things through Amazon Prime. I am not afraid of what this AI will do granted that it can always hear and learn. As long as it's just a black cylinder speaker (with no hidden flame-thrower) I don't believe we have a reason to fear an Echo uprise. Rather, I am more afraid of what the men and women behind the scenes will do. 

Example: 'Echo can hear you from anywhere in the room, so it's always ready to help!' ""I can have the water running, I can be cooking, the TV can be on in the back room, and she still can hear me."" 

All I could think while watching this was, ""Genisys is Skynet!""

Here is a link to the [Amazon page.](http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-SK705DI-Echo/dp/B00X4WHP5E)

So, can anyone give me some reason as to why Amazon Echo can be more helpful than harmful?

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","I'm going to break down each point separately.

1) Amazon Echo creates laziness - So your examples are someone dictating instead of writing, listening to news instead of reading, and asking about weather instead of just looking outside. 

Dictating has been around for quite almost ever. Just because the person isn't writing it down doesn't make them lazy. If we are making assumptions, you can assume that maybe they are becoming more organized and efficient with their time.

As for listening to the news, you could say it's exactly like watching the news on TV or on the Internet. Or it's like listening to the radio. Listening instead of reading is not laziness. It may even make news slightly more accessible which would inform more people (the argument of informing them correctly or incorrectly is a different subject for a different day).

As for weather, I love the weather and just by looking outside I could not tell you what the weather will be like. I still need technology to give me a close educated guess based on stats and history to tell me how hot it's going to be or if there will be a late afternoon shower or if it's going to snow so much that I should probably stay home.

This idea that accessing information by voice is not laziness. It is just another method of educating ourselves in whatever we want to know.

2) Amazon Echo creates a reliance on technology - I think you slightly used the ""The echo is a tool that we use to keep our household functioning."" out of context. First of all, they use it as a tool, much like a cell phone helps keep the household functioning, much like refrigerators help, much like a car helps. These tools do certain things that help make our lives easier so we can spend more time doing whatever we want, or as the ad depicts, spend more time with the family. Secondly, the Echo is not depicted doing anything that current technologies can't already do.

As for shopping, what is the harm in ordering toilet paper by asking your Echo to do so? While yes, some people may go out less because of this, they probably already weren't going out because you can order everything online, without the Echo. And, as the ad shows, this feature (along with others) can be extremely helpful for those with disabilities.

3) Amazon Echo is an Invasion of Privacy - This is a running theme with the Internet of Things. Any piece of technology that can connect to the internet can be used to collect your information and sell it to whoever wants it. The Echo is not the only thing that does this.

Now for it always listening. Sure, slightly terrifying, but it would take a lot of work Amazon to parse through audio from 24/7/365 just to find out what you like and don't like. They will probably keep track of your commands, but they (and most websites, companies, apps, etc.) already do. And for the most part, the big companies use this information to make your experiences with them better. Yes, nefarious things may happen, but companies take big risks by doing so. Just look at [Lenovo and the Superfish fiasco](http://www.cnet.com/news/lenovo-hit-by-lawsuit-over-superfish-adware/#!) and [Samsung with their always listening TVs](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/02/09/385001258/samsungs-privacy-policy-warns-customers-their-smart-tvs-are-listening).

In summary, this device is not harmful because it makes information more accesible (which does not create laziness), it does things that current technology already does, and it is no more of a spy on your life, than your phone or computer already is. In fact, as the video shows, it can make life easier for those with disabilities.","you are inconsistently and ambiguously defining your concerns, and false attributing consequences to technology without offering any data to support your claims.

Reason 1: Laziness

why is jotting a note down on paper less lazy than adding it to a cloud-based shopping list through a voice interface? have you actually used the two side by side? using paper is frequently the fastest method there. using echo, not only do you have to wait for the device to confirm whether it actually performed the action, you have to take out a phone, unlock it, launch an app, and wait for a load before you can even use your shopping list. paper is instantaneous, and you could argue that it's the laziest option. 'it feels lazier' is not a valid conclusion supported by data.

Reason 2: Reliance on Technology

you are already completely, utterly, and irreversibly reliant on technology. others have made this point but i want to stress the absolute and total reality of it to you. every single item around you is human technology. building a fire is technology. you will die very quickly if you stopped using technology. you failed to demonstrate why reliance on technology is bad in general, and why reliance on echo is bad specifically. 

you say
&gt;'clearly there are many issues with one piece of technology keeping a household together' 

but you do not elaborate on what these issues are, or provide evidence that these issues actually exist. you could argue that a family car, a refrigerator, or even the house itself keeps a household together. these are all technology. by your argument, these would all be problematic for some mysterious and unstated reason. 

your other example: 
&gt;'shop by shouting a phrase at a robot, no need to go out' 

this is equally presumptuous and ill-defined. firstly, you haven't actually stated why 'not going out' is a bad thing. maybe it lets me have more time to relax at home instead of standing in line at the market, which is definitely a positive outcome for me. secondly, you assume that not shopping equals not going out, which is plainly not true. maybe with the time that i save by not going to the store, i go out and do something else instead, like see a movie, hang out with friends, or go hiking. here, your argument is based on unfounded assumptions and cannot support your claim. 

when you say 'reliance on technology' what you seem to really mean is that 'we are too reliant on some particular technologies like smartphones and the internet, but it's ok to be reliant on other technologies like electricity and modern food production.' you have picked some arbitrary limit on technological advancement, for example 2006 (just before smartphones) or 1985 (just before popular consumer internet) and have decided that that's the right amount of technology to be reliant on. however, you still haven't provided any convincing arguments as to why that particular level of technology is the right one. 

&gt; In a world full of constant updates and fast information, why should we access things in any other way?

indeed, why? you're claiming that making things slower and more difficult would be better. it's your job to answer this question. 

Reason 3: Invasion of Privacy

yes, this may be a legitimate concern generally. however, it is true of many technologies aside from echo. you have not argued sufficiently that echo is worse in this regard, or provided any actual evidence that privacy has been invaded. the potential for harm to occur is not the same as harm actually occurring. if we banned technology based on the potential for harm, we'd have to ban basically everything: kitchen knives, leather belts, baseball bats, you get the idea.

in summation, i have shown that your position on this issue is flawed in specific and demonstrable ways. you cannot make the claim you're making without updating or revising your position, and therefore must change your view.",B,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B effectively breaks down each of the original poster's concerns and provides logical arguments and examples to counter them. The response highlights the flaws in the original poster's reasoning and challenges their assumptions with clear and concise explanations. Additionally, Reply B offers a more nuanced perspective on the potential benefits of Amazon Echo and addresses the concerns about privacy in a rational manner. Overall, Reply B presents a stronger and more convincing argument that is likely to prompt the original poster to reconsider their views on Amazon Echo."
predict-explain,"The state of Palestine has 4 million people residing within Isreal. The West Bank and Gaza strip together have 6,000 square kilometers of land. The North Sinai Governorate alone has 27,000 square Kilometers of land, that's more land than even Isreal has (22,000 sq km).

[Here is what a State of Palestine could look like on a map, either with only the Northern part or the full peninsula.](http://sinaimaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/governorates-sinai-egypt.jpg)

One could argue that the Sinai Peninsula is mostly desert and unfit for people to live in, but Israel was mostly desert when they began immigrating to the region too. Irrigation, agriculture, forestry, and artificial canals have been known to combat or reverse desertification.

The people already residing there can be promised equal citizenship rights in the new state of Palestine. Egypt could even allow for the people there to have duel citizenship, so that they can choose to either stay in the new state or easily move to inland Egypt. If necessary, Egypt could offer incentives for Sinai people to move inland prior to the establishment of the state.

If a ""buffer"" line/zone were felt to be necessary, it could be jointly run by Israel and Egypt stationed outside the borders without much issue from the Palestinians. The U.N. Security council could send peacekeepers to the peninsula to monitor the region's development. There would be very little reason for any of the Security members to veto this decision if Egypt, Israel, and Palestine all agreed to this.

Albeit, it's extremely unlikely this will ever happen, but I think it would be a good solution. Which is why I'm here, what is wrong with this plan?

**Edit:** Added what can happen with the people already living there.","One basic way of refuting this idea is by simply looking at the current situation in the Sinai Peninsula. 



First, the region has always been populated by people. The native bedouin people have lived in that region far longer than you seem to be giving them credit for. Most of them migrated there between 1300 and 1700. Quite a long time for a place that so inhospitable. 

Also, Israel might have been ""mostly dessert"" but the whole reason we need a Palestine state is because of the millions of people the Israel state forced into refugee status by making them leave. It might have been mostly dessert, but damn, it was home to a lot of people. 

Egypt certainly could offer the things you mentioned to the Bedouin people. Egypt has abjectly refused to do so, and has created a terrible caste system whereby terrorist groups have thrived in the region, so I do not see this happening anytime soon. But sure, in a perfect world, that could theoretically happen. (Are you familiar at all with what is going on in this region??, are we talking about the same Egypt, the northern Africa country that has gone through three leaders in the past five years? The one with the pyramids?)

I'm not even sure I want to talk about a buffer zone right now. Its late, and the current buffer zone is being executed so terribly and horrendously right now that I do not think that term should be uttered in geopolitical conversations concerning this region. 

I guess more than anything I am confused by your view prompt. Are you saying that if the things you mentioned happened that a Palestine state could thrive? 

I mean if the planets align and ponies sprout wings with rainbows coming out their butts, then yea sure this might happen. I would rather you suggest Utah as a solution, or maybe suggest building an island in the middle of the ocean out of old two litter bottles of soda. At least then, there is a more realistic possibility.","1) What do you propose is done with the West Bank?

2) Even ignoring the difficulty of actually growing crops in the Sinai, Israeli efforts to reduce desertification were possible only due to large amounts of foreign funds and resources that poured into the state after its foundation. The Palestinian diaspora has no such source of funding, hence it is doubtful that they would be able to actually water in a climate that is even more harsh than Israel's is, on average.

3) Israel is generally thought of as being one of the most over-populated areas in the world, relative to it's carrying capacity. It is possible that global warming will exacerbate the issue along with the changing climate, and this would also likely apply to the Palestinian Sinai.

4) Egypt won't sign on to it because it weakens their hold over the Suez Canal by putting a foreign nation on the other bank pretty close to the canal.

5) Palestine won't sign on to it because, let's face it, they just won't. You're implicitly saying that the Palestinians should be forced to move out of their present lands for no reason other than their own ethnicity.

6) Israel won't sign on to it because lately the Israeli government has been against the establishment of any Arab Palestinian government in the region.",B,A,"I would say Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides specific points addressing the feasibility and practicality of the proposed solution, such as the challenges of agriculture in the Sinai Peninsula, the lack of funding for such projects, the potential overpopulation issues, and the geopolitical implications for Egypt and Palestine. These points are well thought out and backed up with logical reasoning, which could potentially make the original poster reconsider their stance.

On the other hand, Reply A focuses more on criticizing the original poster's proposal without providing as much concrete reasoning or counterarguments. While it does bring up some valid points about the current situation in the Sinai Peninsula and the challenges faced by the Bedouin people, it lacks the depth and specificity of Reply B in addressing the practicality of the proposed solution."
predict-explain,"I have a few friends who sleep around a lot. One person in particular told me yesterday that they had slept with 6 people in the last two weeks (I'm keeping this purposefully gender-neutral to avoid a biased response). They didn't massively like any of the partners as people, they just wanted to have sex. Which is fine. 

I love sex, and I think it's great, but I could never feel okay with having that many sexual partners in such a short space of time. I can't help but feel that there must be something deeply broken about someone who IS okay with it. Either they're very insecure and in need of some sort of validation, or they have no respect for themselves and a very low sense of self-worth.

Change my view please!

That doesn't necessarily indicate any insecurity or damage.

Plenty of people just think sex is a fun activity that really has no moral or even any great emotional component to it. For people like this, having sex with everyone they pick up at a bar is no more or less a simple fun activity than going to the bar in the first place. 

Such people, and I have met them, simply don't place any particular weight, in terms of their self worth or otherwise, on sex. It's just a hobby, like playing soccer. 

That would be a difference of opinion, not an indication of insecurity.","Your opinion doesn't seem to actually be based on anything. You say you feel like there must be something deeply broken about someone who is okay with it, only because you wouldn't be okay with it.

Some people just see sex as a fun thing to do. They enjoy experiencing it with different people and don't necessarily need for it to be or feel like something more than that. 

It is perfectly fine that you would not be comfortable with it, and there are obviously people who do this that have deep seeded emotional problems, just as there are people who don't have any sex that have deep seeded emotional problems, but having a lot of random sex doesn't necessarily say anything about the person.

Allow other people to make their own decisions, and don't judge someones character or personality based on decisions they make that do not harm anyone.",A,B,"I believe that reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a different perspective on the issue, suggesting that some people simply have different values when it comes to sex and do not necessarily attach the same emotional or moral significance to it as the original poster does. By framing the issue as a difference of opinion rather than a sign of insecurity or low self-worth, reply A challenges the original poster to consider that there are valid reasons why someone might engage in casual sex without it indicating any underlying issues.

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on dismissing the original poster's opinion as unfounded and judgmental, without providing a counterargument or alternative perspective. While reply B acknowledges that the original poster may not be comfortable with casual sex, it does not effectively address the underlying assumptions about insecurity or self-worth that the original poster raised.

Overall, reply A presents a more nuanced and empathetic perspective that is more likely to encourage the original poster to reconsider their views on casual sex and the motivations behind it."
predict-explain,"Oat blenders.  Mini spooners.  Coco roos.  Honey Scooters.  You know them.  You see them in the cereal section of any grocery store.  They are in giant bags in a metal bin right next to the boxed cereals.  Far too often, these bagged cereals are breezed past and not rightfully regarded as the most superior way to purchase cereal.

* Price - Cant beat it.  Per unit weight, they are far cheaper than their boxed counterparts.

* Freshness - Fresh to death.  The bags all come with a resealable spout, much like a ziploc bag.  Squeeze all the air out, reseal, and you are ready for the next day.  

* Taste - Admittedly, they are not superior in taste to boxed counterparts.  But they are indistinguishable.  

* Environmental - Bagged cereals use less than half the packaging of boxed cereals.  

* Quantity - Get a lot more, which prevents you from having to worry about breakfast for much longer. 

* Hilarity - I snicker to myself every day that I pour myself a bowl of apple zings. Never once chuckled at a box of applejax. 

Edit - Some good points about selection and variety.  Maybe I should have rephrased my title better to reflect that bagged cereals are better than their boxed counterparts.  I want to reward people for their good points, but I don't know if deltas are the best way to do it as my view was not changed.","Boxed cereal stores better in that you can stack them. The extra price is that you are paying for that storage and for a brand name. 

As for freshness, that is fairly  random. You are not at all guaranteed for them to be more fresh. I have also never encountered a bagged cereal with a resealable spout. They have always required attempting to tie the bag in some manner or putting them in a separate container.","Boxes:

* stack neatly (if the sizes match, which they are standardized)
* give you cardboard which can be used for crafts or educational purposes.

In addition, boxed-cereal brands typically:

* provide better reading material/activities on the back of the box
* contain better ""prizes""
* have more entertaining ad campaigns, which in turn fund other types of entertainment.

I don't know if that's enough of a difference to merit the price difference. (And honestly, almost all, even ""healthy"" breakfast cereal is diabetes-bait. I'd stick with a nice omelette or steel-cut oats with sea salt.)",B,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides practical reasons why boxed cereals may be a better option, such as the ability to stack them for storage and the fact that bagged cereals may not always be more fresh. Additionally, Reply A addresses the issue of resealability, stating that bagged cereals may not always come with a convenient resealable spout. These points may cause the original poster to reconsider their stance on bagged cereals being superior."
predict-explain,"I'll start off by saying I'm a vegetarian and I also try to limit the eggs and dairy I eat, I try to buy no leather and no other animal byproducts. When there are leftovers from dinners with guests, etc. I'll eat that (throwing meat away is definitely worse than eating it). I try to do as much as I can for the environment and animals, I have very little money so I do not donate to animal rights organizations but I certainly would if I could.

I'm trying to be as reasonable as possible on the subject, I try not to see individuals as evil 'cause they think it's normal to torture animals, I understand it's a cultural thing although I loathe humanity in general.

I also think the hypothetical contribution of even a billion of the strictest vegans imaginable wouldn't change things a bit.

As of today I'm making this choice exclusively because it makes me feel good / at peace with myself, 'cause if I think about the contribution to the environment, I'm sorry but I just can't believe I'm doing anything significant.

I'm 100% convinced on what I've done for a year now, and I'll become as ""vegan"" as possible in the future (I hate this whole ""vegan"" thing, it should be something natural like being against slavery), I'm NOT looking for an excuse to quit. But I know it'll only benefit my ethics and my self-esteem.

I know that for every person like me (and I'm nowhere near good) there are one thousand who don't give a damn. I know that there are TENS OF BILLIONS animals being tortured for food, and unless the world miraculously turns vegan overnight, there's no chance any of this will change. Change my view.

On the eating leftovers thing, I also have to add.. I've been to a wedding recently and I got vegetarian courses, it was really no hassle for anyone... but I looked at the courses with fish and meat and I just thought of all the stuff they'd be throwing away that day... if I ate meat and fish that day it would have made NO difference at all... maybe it would have been better, saved the cook some work...

For me the key point is not BUYING meat rather than not eating it, I get it, and having vegetarian stuff served that day and making things look positive for everyone and having conversations with others about being vegetarian was a positive thing... but the actual contribution to things? That restaurant probably threw away ten times what I could have eaten. It's depressing.

I still recommend that people switch to a vegetarian (or vegan) lifestyle, I think it's a GOOD thing by all means. It's a fantastic feeling, it's healthy, and a million other things. As I said I haven't stopped believing in the lifestyle and I'll never quit. I just believe the actual contribution to the environment and the well being of animals is insignificant, and expecting results is hopeless.

**I have found a convincing argument and I think that made me change my mind. Although many answers were backed up by very uplifting data, I couldn't justify changing my mind since I couldn't help but believe things are changing way too slowly, and that the damage might still be irreparable in the long run.**

&gt; Eventually — not soon, but maybe in a generation or two — I would not be surprised if the majority of people on the liberal side of the fence started to shun meat-eating, as has happened with social issues in recent years. And at that point, changes will be sweeping and sudden.

I have never thought about critical mass. I still believe the situation is a lot more complex than just the West, but even believing that one day a relatively sudden change could happen like it did with LGBT rights based on public opinion reaching critical mass makes me believe there's something to look for behind the hard numbers.

**Another great argument with links**

[Expected Utility, Contributory Causation, and Vegetarianism](http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/thresholds.pdf)  
Both of these essays approach your question in a statistics-based manner that focuses on thresholds. They propose that your effect on meat production is a measurable probability.  
In other words, they ask questions like, ""What are the odds that your purchase of, say, a frozen turkey will be the one that causes your grocery store to order another entire shipment of frozen turkeys? And that that shipment causes the food distributor to order more turkeys? And that that shipment causes a farm to slaughter more turkeys?""

I'd say you look at it the wrong way, though.

As you said elsewhere, meat consumtion is rising. The reason for this is that it is easy and normal to eat meat, and not normal and harder when you do not. The more people that primarily eat vegetarian and vegan food, the more plausible it is for restaurants to sell vegetarian food, and the easier it is for people to choose to be a vegetarian, and the more vegetarian and vegan food is offered in other circumstances. In my region of the world, and then I mean maybe the closest 5 to 15 million people, the availability and accessibility of vegetarian and vegan options has risen dramatically in the last few decades, even though meat consumtion has risen as well due to changed habits of omnivores.. but this is turning, as of a few years ago. Omnivores are now lessening their amount of meat in their diet, and even more people are turning vegan and vegetarian or just ""I don't eat meat very often""-etarian, and it has gone to the point when arranging some events the crew don't even ask who is vegetarian, who is vegan anymore. They just simply offer vegan food for everyone instead, unless someone explicitly specify that they need meat, or whatever.

Since meat need approximately ten times as much land to produce the same amount of food as veggies, and meat production is said to stand for close to 20% of the amount of climate change gases, this may have an enormous effect. Not very much for each veg*n by themselves, but due to the effect they have in motivating each other, motivating others, making selling veggies plausible for restaurants, and in the end have a so much larger effect on the world than they ever would by themselves.

It's pretty much like voting, except they/we do it every day, so the possible effect is probably a lot larger.","It's not about monetary or practical impact, necessarily. It's about changing the discourse. A few decades ago, far fewer people were taking vegetarianism and veganism seriously. Now we have conversations about animal rights and welfare in public. There have been more animal cruelty related posts and comment threads on Reddit in the past year than I remember previously — and far less RAH RAH WHAT'S WRONG WITH EATING MEAT type replies. More and more restaurants are offering vegetarian and vegan options. Eventually — not soon, but maybe in a generation or two — I would not be surprised if the majority of people on the liberal side of the fence started to shun meat-eating, as has happened with social issues in recent years. And at that point, change will be sweeping and sudden.",B,A,"I would say that reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a detailed explanation of how individual choices to eat vegetarian or vegan food can have a ripple effect on society. It discusses how the availability and accessibility of vegetarian and vegan options have increased in their region, and how this can lead to a larger impact on the world. The argument about how meat production contributes significantly to climate change and requires more land is also compelling.

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on changing the discourse and societal attitudes towards vegetarianism and veganism. While this is important, it may not directly address the original poster's concerns about the practical impact of their individual choices.

Overall, reply A provides a more practical and data-driven argument that directly addresses the original poster's concerns about the impact of their choices on the environment and animal welfare."
predict-explain,"So I'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player, Zach Jesse, was banned presumably because of his past criminal history which includes a sexual assault guilty plea when he was 19. I'm not aware of the exact circumstances surrounding his offense. 

What unsettles me about the ban is that it seems to have occurred because another player, Drew Levin, pointed out Jesse's criminal past with a Twitter post: """"Quick reminder: Zach Jesse is a literal rapist who got away with serving three months of an eight year plea deal."" It should be noted that this is a very speculative and misleading statement, as the public is not aware of the details surrounding his plea.

Wizards of the Coast gave a short statement saying that the reasoning behind the ban was to ensure that players feel safe at events. Obviously a worthy endeavor, but I don't see how it really applies here. We are talking about large events at convention centers with thousands of people, security, etc. If, in the eyes of the law, he is not considered a threat to the public (i.e. not in jail) then how can Wizards see him as one?

And what's the point in attempting to rehabilitate criminals if they are to be forever shunned from participating even in large public events? It's not like the guy is applying for a teaching job at an elementary school or something. They even banned him from online play.

Lastly, I do not think Wizards should have taken this action based on a Twitter witch-hunt that was started by another player. If they want to have a universal no criminal record policy at all of their events, then maybe it would be justified. But to selectively ban one person because he was villified on a social media site is pretty unreasonable, IMO.

I want to hear people's thoughts on this because it seems like the r/magictcg community is vehemently opposed to the ban. I'd like to hear some outside opinion's. The SRS crowd seems to support the ban, calling r/magictcg a bunch of rape apologists, etc, but then again the SRS crowd is not very logical or reasonable. So I'd like to hear what you all think. CMV,

Edit: If anyone can provide a source that he was convicted of rape, I will award you a delta.

Edit: So my view has been changed due to new information I have been made aware of regarding the details of Jesse's crime. Anally raping an unconscious girl over a toilet is pretty despicable, I had no idea his offense was even close to that magnitude. Thanks everyone who responded here. I can understand with why Wizards does not want someone who has done something so vulgar to be a top name in their tournament scene.

If you want to be you can get a copy of his plea agreement as all agreements for felonies must be submitted in writing to the Circuit Court.  You can contact the Charlottesville Circuit Court Clerk [here](http://www.courts.state.va.us/courts/circuit/charlottesville/home.html). Now he didn't get away with serving 3 months of an 8 year sentence he was literally sentenced to 8 years with all but 3 months suspended.  In other words the judge sentenced him to a three month active sentence and can revoke the suspended period should he commit another violation during his period of good behavior.

&gt; he is not considered a threat to the public

He is a violent sex offender.  He has to let the police know where he lives and works at all times so they can keep tabs on him.  He is visited at a minimum of once a year by a State Police officer who verifies this information through a surprise visit.  In addition he must provide the police any and all usernames on social media, email addresses, vehicles he regularly uses, and his dna.  [See Va Code 9.1-903](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title9.1/chapter9/section9.1-903/)

He wasn't convicted of rape he had the charge reduced to aggravated sexual battery under Va Code 18.2-67.3 from rape.  You can find it by looking him up [here in the Charlottesville Circuit Court](http://ewsocis1.courts.state.va.us/CJISWeb/MainMenu.do).  While the charge was reduced from rape the statement of facts which he admitted was accurate as part of his plea agreement states that he anally and vaginally raped a girl.  You can get that from the clerk's office as it was made part of the record.

Edit: spelling","&gt;Edit: If anyone can provide a source that he was convicted of rape, I will award you a delta.

I'm not sure if this is enough, but you can read a report on it [here](http://www.readthehook.com/95057/news-uva-rape-case-student-accepts-lesser-charge). He was charged with rape and plead to aggravated sexual battery (according to [this](http://www.wm.edu/offices/police/sexualassault/laws/) the difference is vaginal penetration, though I couldn't find that in the statutes specifically). He plead guilty to aggravated sexual battery because a rape conviction has a 5 year minimum sentence and that charge was dropped because of the plea, not because of the specific facts at hand.

This would be in line with the tweet:

&gt;""""Quick reminder: Zach Jesse is a literal rapist who got away with serving three months of an eight year plea deal.""

It doesn't say *convicted* rapist, it says *literal* rapist. I can't see anything where he argues he didn't have sex with her, just that it was consensual and/or the alcohol's fault. The aggravated sexual battery charge alone would match other state's as well as some people's colloquial definition of ""rape."" If this was nonconsensual (as he plead guilty to) and involved penetration then it would indeed be rape, and the lesser charge would be an artifact of the plea  bargaining system (as the person mentions).

Again, not sure if that satisfies your ""convicted of rape"" requirement, and I want to specify I am not at all making any comment on the banning, but it is the facts of the case as far as I have been able to find and understand them.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides detailed information about the legal aspects of Zach Jesse's case, including the charges he pleaded guilty to and the conditions of his sentence. It also highlights the severity of his actions and the ongoing monitoring he is subject to as a violent sex offender. This information may help the original poster understand why Wizards of the Coast took the action they did and why some people support the ban. Reply A also provides sources for the information presented, adding credibility to the argument. Overall, Reply A presents a strong case for why the ban on Zach Jesse was justified."
predict-explain,"Hello CMV,

I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from your basic youth teams) and never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing it was simple as that. By losing and not being rewarded we understood we had to try harder as an individual and try harder as a team to win. This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team.  I really dont understand the idea of rewarding everyone for not winning, it's almost like saying ""hey, even if you dont try you still win"". I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize. To me that just teaches a kid that NOT giving your best will still result in a prize. What lesson does that teach you when you grow up? That your failure or lack of effort will be rewarded regardless of how you performed? Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up? Personally if I had a kid and he/she played a sport I wouldn't allow the coach or a parent to give them a trophy for simply participating, I would make them understand that a reward/trophy is earned by hard work and dedication. I know not all kids are athletic but I still dont understand the concept or idea. 
We all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? Again, I am not trying to sound cold but I just dont understand the concept of rewarding 
failure/losing, CMV......

Edit: thanks for all the answers, feedback and insight. Many of you helped CMV. Again, I hope I didn't come off as cold or inconsiderate. I have younger cousins and love to see them succeed in anything they do, especially sports. I was more interested in having a discussion as to ""why"" and the mentality behind it. Many of you made valid arguments and gave me some great insight. I'm happy to keep discussing if people are interested but please note I am not against the idea but was more interested in helping me change my view of it. If anything please continue to give your children positive feedback, effective communication, motivation and let them know that team work is a great thing. I recommend everyone put their kids in sports (dont push them into it but help and guide them into something they love doing or are very passionate about). It really does pay off when you get older and helps them build some self confidence and understand the dynamics of a social environment. Thanks again everyone! 

Edit 2: Since the discussion continues, I think children under 12 should only get participation Trophies. Once you hit that age you should be teaching your kids the fundamentals of structured team work, effort and the idea that life will not reward your for simply showing up. Giving participation trophies to kids 13 and above is not a good life lesson. If you care to continue CMV on that! 

Edit 3: Thanks everyone for the continued conversation, input, points of views and personal experiences. This sub is great for people who are curious as to get the other sides opinion and everyone should keep an open mind about changing their view on the matter. Now some last bit of advice for coaches and parents who put their kids in sports. PLEASE keep your eye out for the that one un-athletic kid who might not be the best on the team and make sure that his/her team mates understand this is a team event and that everyone is in this together. Some of these personal experiences shared with me shed some light on how people hated playing sports  and were being bulled because they were that kid and the other kids made them feel left out. Not all kids will be good athletes but you can teach your kids to respect one another, support one another and to ensure that they understand the unity of team work. If your kid is that ""all-star"" on the team then make them understand this most because the other kids will look to him/her to see how they treat the rest of the team. A good leader will understand this and this habit will grow with them, you just have to show them how and why. Thanks again for all the input, this is a great sub.","&gt; never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing.

I find this *so* ironic.  You realize that 2nd place is nothing but the first loser, right?  And 3rd place?.... don't even get me started.

So why are you ok with the first and 2nd losers getting trophies (and, presumably, even accepted them yourself in your youth) but the 3rd loser, 4th loser, 5th loser, etc. get nothing?

In the words of Herm Edwards, you.play.to.win.the.game!  That means there are two categories:  The winner and the losers.  Either you support losers getting trophies or you don't; and if you support *some* losers getting trophies because they are ""better losers"" than other losers, then you're just hypocritical.","So first in that age range those trophies are more mementos and reminders, the only reason I know the years when I played soccer as a kid is those trophies. They're like a stuffed animal you buy at the zoo. That said I do agree we should recognize the winning teams so there is something to play for. I personally like the four trophy type method. There a small trophy for just playing, and then 3rd, 2nd, and 1st get better trophies that increase in awesomeness the higher you place. This way everyone gets a memento, but they still play hard to get the 'best' one they can.",A,B,"I believe reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B acknowledges the importance of participation trophies as mementos and reminders, highlighting their sentimental value to children. It also suggests a compromise by introducing a system where everyone gets a trophy for participating, but the winners receive better trophies, incentivizing hard work and dedication. This approach addresses the original poster's concerns about rewarding effort and teaching the value of hard work, while still recognizing the importance of participation and inclusion. Overall, reply B offers a more balanced and nuanced perspective on the issue, making it more likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially change their view."
predict-explain,"The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg).

&gt;Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.

I've seen people use this quote many times. To me, it's inflammatory anti-religious nonsense. I'm interested to see the other perspective. Have I misunderstood his quote? Is there something about human nature that I've misunderstood?

First of all, I recognize that religion can cause good people to do bad things. It has done it many times and it will continue to do so. ISIS is the most obvious example right now, but there are countless other examples as well.

What I can't understand is the last sentence:

&gt;But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.

He seems to be saying that **only religion** can cause good people to do bad things. This seems like total nonsense to me. TONS of things can cause good people to do bad things.

For example, soldiers who commit war crimes sometimes do so because they were ""just following orders,"" out of a sense of patriotism, or in order to protect their families.

Poverty can make good people do evil things. 

Drugs can, too. They can temporarily taking away people's sanity, which causes them to do stupid things. Or drug addictions can drive people to such financial desperation that they're willing to do evil things to get their next hit.

---

Let me explain what I understand by ""good people"" and ""evil things."" Perhaps I haven't properly understood what Weinberg meant by these words?

A ""good person"" is someone who wouldn't normally do an evil thing without the influence of some outside force. In the case of this quote, the ""outside force"" is religion.

An ""evil thing"" is anything that society generally sees as extremely bad, such as murder. 

In order to CMV, please:

* convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things.
* show me that I could've misunderstood Weinberg.
* show me that my definitions of ""good person"" or ""evil thing"" are wrong (in the context of Weinberg's quote, of course).
* anything else that shows that anything I've said is wrong.

Edit: Cleaned the post up a little bit.","&gt;convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things.

That depends. When do you define a person by their actions whether they're good and when do you define them by their ideology?

Indoctrination happens in mostly religious households and scenarios. Yes, political as well, but when it comes to beliefs and values I think religion does the indoctrination part a bit more. Especially with the whole ""hell if you don't believe"" idea.

I think that someone isn't a good person if they have an ideology I disagree with. I think nationalists are bad, fascists are bad and so on. So when it comes to ideology, they're not good people doing bad things, they're bad people doing bad things.

&gt;show me that I could've misunderstood Weinberg.

I mean it's all about interpretation.

""Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.""

He's certainly right when saying with or without religion, good people would do good things and bad people would do evil things.

Some actions aren't evil, yet aren't good either. So maybe good people could do bad things yet not evil.

Theft is an obvious example. It's not a good thing surely, and good people could do this whether or not they were religious, for different reasons. But it's hardly *evil*. Sometimes, theft is necessary or them to survive.

Can't really think of anything else to add here.

&gt;show me that my definitions of ""good person"" or ""evil thing"" are wrong (in the context of Weinberg's quote, of course).

I suppose I already said what I thought on here.

&gt;anything else that shows that anything I've said is wrong.

I agree that drugs is a problem. But then you could have the philosophical discussion like... Are they really themselves when influenced by drugs?

Religious people aren't drunk or intoxicated when doing things, they're fully aware.","I think that Weinberg's statement could be right with different definitions for both ""religion"" and ""evil things"". Firstly, ""religion"" would have to be expanded to mean any strongly held belief which forms a core of beliefs and is often immune to criticism from it's adherents. This interpretation could include things such as international communism or pan-nationalist racism, rather than simply organised religion which is a fairer comment.  
Secondly, ""evil things"" would have to be narrowed to mean things more specific than just what society considers to be extremely bad. For instance, killing another in self-defence would not be considered evil, and arguably neither is killing to resolve a situation. Arguably it would take the premeditated and dispassionate murder of an individual which can only come from blind devotion to a religion (in the expanded sense). In other words, it takes religion to push the aspects of human nature which are simply nasty into evil.",B,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more nuanced interpretation of Weinberg's statement by expanding the definition of ""religion"" to include any strongly held belief system, not just organized religion. This broader definition allows for the consideration of ideologies like international communism or pan-nationalist racism, which can also lead good people to do evil things. Additionally, by narrowing the definition of ""evil things"" to premeditated and dispassionate acts of murder, Reply B shows that religion (in the expanded sense) can push individuals to commit truly evil acts that go beyond societal norms.

On the other hand, Reply A focuses more on personal beliefs and interpretations, which may not be as effective in changing the original poster's view. While it does touch on the idea of indoctrination and the influence of ideology, Reply B provides a clearer and more specific argument that directly addresses the original poster's concerns about Weinberg's quote."
predict-explain,"The U.S. Constitution is an old document. At the time it was written, it made a lot of sense, and it was a large jump ahead for democracy, politics, and the human condition as a whole.

Unfortunately, failure to foresee that conditions in the future might warrant a radically different document means that the Constitution enshrines certain rights that make no sense in the modern day, and can indeed be harmful to the fabric of society, while ignoring others that are now far more relevant. The Constitution depends on there being nearly no nuance in the rights it affords, something that may have worked better in a simpler, less complex, and crucially, less populous nation. 

The problem is compounded by the fact that making substantial changes to the document is difficult, if not to say nearly impossible in any but the best of circumstances.

Those combined factors mean that the U.S. may, slowly but surely, become backward compared to other countries with modern founding documents and laws. The solutions are apparent, and in some cases have been tested successfully in other countries, but the Constitution makes change insubstantial  and insufficient if changes come at all.

Technically, every law passed informally amends the constitution. But the founders were afraid of mobocracy. They wanted a way to 'check' the people. The easiest way is to use the mob organization principle against the mob. Mobs come together to be stupid. Not smart and pass meaningful laws. 

Look at it this way, from a Hegelian stance, the best laws are created by the process being hard.","The Constitution is designed to facilitate slow change so as to check the people and give plenty of time to correct rash decisions that could tumble out of control. You have to really fight for something, and get a decent amount of support before it becomes the law of the land and thus affects everyone. Yes, this means we will always be ""behind"" compared to other countries, but at least we (generally) have the security of knowing that the laws we passed didn't simply come about from a plurality vote in an election, or a majority vote in a direct democracy. I would argue that the U.S. Constitution is a better reflection of the voice of its citizens than many other seemingly ""progressive"" countries.",A,A,"I would say reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B presents a counterargument by highlighting the importance of slow change and the security that comes with ensuring laws are not passed hastily. It also emphasizes that the U.S. Constitution reflects the voice of its citizens, which may resonate with the original poster's concerns about the Constitution being outdated. Reply B provides a different perspective on the issue and offers a valid argument for the current system in place."
predict-explain,"Sorry, this is mostly applicable to folks from the US, but feel free to weigh in no matter what.  I'll bullet-point for my reasoning:

* More good folks are killed via firearms than are saved by them.  The vast majority of firearm deaths are via suicide, which has an incredibly high success rate compared to all other methods.  Therefore since firearms cause more deaths than they prevent, firearms pose a net-loss for society.

* One major reason we believe we need firearms is the 2nd amendment.  The 2nd amendment is essentially an axiom; in order to have a moral argument as to why we should have guns, I don't think ""because the 2nd amendment says so"" is compelling.  If the 2nd amendment told us to punch babies, that wouldn't make it okay.  Therefore whether or not firearms are truly acceptable must be for a reason outside of this.

* Our logical balance doesn't make sense.  To paraphrase John Oliver, one guy tried to blow up a plane with a shoe and now we all take our shoes off at security.  But so many people shoot up so many schools, and we still haven't done anything substantial about it.  On a similar note, we invest how many trillions of dollars on the war on terror, and yet the amount of Americans killed via guns exceeds the amount killed via terrorism by an extraordinary amount.

* I've read Scalia's opinion in D.C. v. Heller (The most important guns case in modern times).  I don't find the appeal to history compelling.  It seems to me that times have changed so much that arguing what Thomas Jefferson was thinking and then applying it to semi-automatic and automatic weapons just doesn't make sense.  For someone who claims to be a textualist, this appears to me to be a stretch.

* The 2nd amendment and it's current interpretation quashes any possibility of experimentation.  I think part of the American experiment is to allow different states to try different things.  One of the arguments for gun rights is ""what worked for Australia couldn't work for us"".  And yet one only needs to look at Chicago (the city banned some firearms, SCOTUS said that was unacceptable and ruled against Chicago's law) to see that we were never given a chance to figure out what worked.  I would normally suggest an amendment if we wanted to clarify the 2nd amendment for modern times, but it seems to me that nobody will ever be convinced guns are bad (or good!) until we have a concrete application and see whether it works or not.

Outlawing guns will only do one thing: Make it easier for bad guys to kill good guys. In days of prohibition they outlawed alcohol, yet criminals still got it and regular citizens didn't. Certain types of drugs are outlawed yet you still have people getting their hands on them. I think you'll find that even if you ban guns people will still have guns ... except they won't be the good people.

People like Penn Jilette and Alex Cross are good when it comes to pointing out why we need guns. Penn points out that in the amendment it says that the right shall not be infringed and that it is the right of the PEOPLE to carry guns as the militia does. It doesn't say it is the right of the militia (cops) to carry a gun, rather it is the right of ordinary citizens, because the people that wrote that document in there were fighting a war against their tyrannical government that had better weapons than them. The gun rights for citizens aren't in there simply to hunt, but to protect yourself.

A guy blew up people with his shoe at an airport, so we take our shoes off there; A guy shot up a school, so now school are gun-free zones and it is illegal to enter a school with a gun ... there you go. We're not going to outlaw all guns simply because they were used to kill children at a school, just like we won't outlaw all shoes because one was used to blow up a plane.

It's true that there weren't fully automatic weapons in the days our country fought it's war of independence ... but that means no one had those weapons ... The point is to arm yourself just as the government does, so if the government has fully automatic weapons, therefor to best protect yourself you might need one too. However, I disagree that we need fully automatics anyway, you can do a lot more a lot more precise with a semi automatic than you can a fully automatic.

How's this for convincing? Hitler took guns away from the Jews and only the Jews ... then the Holocaust happened. Millions of Jews murdered by their government ... imagine if they had a even a little pistol to protect themselves, that's millions of guns being fired against the Germans and would have obviously inflicted some heavy casualties on the Nazis to the point WWII might not have happened because Hitler would have been so ruined by the loss of half his army. Stalin took away his peoples guns ... murdered them. Mao took away their guns ... murdered them. Castro ... Pol Pot ... and even today in our lifetime North Korean citizens don't have guns, and their people are being raped and killed by their own military.","If you believe in the right to life then you will eventually get to the point of guns being a right too. They are the best way for one to defend oneself, and defend their liberty. Either way there are more defensive uses with a gun than there are offensive uses with a gun. 

http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2013/06/handguns_suicides_mass_shootings_deaths_and_self_defense_findings_from_a.html

Your first point is just untrue.

&gt;Our logical balance doesn't make sense.

What John Oliver said doesn't make taking our shoes off right, but just proves why we shouldn't do it anymore. It was done when people were scared, doing the same thing with guns would be just as stupid.

&gt; Thomas Jefferson was thinking and then applying it to semi-automatic and automatic weapons just doesn't make sense.

They knew semi-auto was a thing, and still wouldn't care. They wanted people to be armed the same way any general military of the time would be.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girandoni_Air_Rifle

&gt;The 2nd amendment and it's current interpretation quashes any possibility of experimentation.

You shouldn't be able to experiment with removing human rights. Even still DC banned handguns in the 70s and Chicago soon after, and their homicide went up and  didn't drop until decades later when the rest of the countries murder rates began dropping. The fact is those experiments have failed, even Australia's criminologists admit that their gun control did not make them safer from homicide and violent crime.

I think I disagree because I don't think that this aspect alone could trump (no pun intended, honestly) any amount of good a President could do. Eliminating a President because of one flaw, no matter how severe, can be bad.

For instance, if you had 10 candidates that exaggerate their finances while you have 1 candidate who doesn't, but has policies that would essentially end the world due to their nuke trigger-happy beliefs, I definitely would not vote the last one for fear of Cold War: The Sequel (This time, it's personal).

I definitely would never vote Trump and Scott Walker either, but not for those reasons alone. Had they had incredible policies that would improve this nation better than the other candidates, I would have chosen them as the President despite this one aspect. There's a potential they may damage the economy somewhat, yes, but if their policies can make up for that, I'd choose them.

Unfortunately, the examples you gave are bad Presidents altogether, but concrete examples aside, the concept is there. This trait can be outweighed by goodness.","Scott Walker: Having $10,000 in credit card debt means nothing if you make $137,092 a year as he does. He can easily pay that off in two months, and possibly pay it off in one if he has few bills due that month. That is fiscally responsible. 

Donald Trump: A cursory Google search actually puts him at being worth 4 billion. So you do have a point of him. 

Edit: It should also be noted that the President has very little power or influence over the federal budget. Congress sets the budget and the President executes what they set by approving it, or he vetoes the budget.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a more nuanced and balanced perspective on the issue, acknowledging that a candidate's flaws should not automatically disqualify them if they have strong policies that could benefit the country. The reply also brings up the importance of considering the overall impact a candidate could have, rather than focusing solely on one aspect of their personal finances.

In contrast, Reply B focuses more on defending Scott Walker's personal debt and providing some information on Donald Trump's net worth, but does not address the broader implications of these issues on their ability to govern effectively. Additionally, the reply's assertion that the President has little power over the federal budget is not entirely accurate, as the President plays a significant role in shaping and proposing the budget to Congress.

Overall, Reply A presents a more compelling argument by considering the bigger picture and the potential impact of a candidate's policies on the country."
predict-explain,"To be honest, I'm not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement. The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. Currently, the migrant crisis is one of the biggest items of concern for Europeans. Most Europeans say, with much accuracy, that the migrant stream has to be shut off because a) immigrants are a weight on the economy, and b) most migrants refuse to assimilate, creating a lot of social problems. However, I still feel like they have to own up to that problem. Western societies historically engaged in colonialism and imperialism and profited over it so much, that they achieved wealth that continues to earn their country the status of ""developed/first-world."" Often times when they did this, they ended up creating conditions in the colonized country that would be unfavorable to their future development. I know most Europeans/Americans would respond to this by saying ""I had nothing to do with this, why should I take responsibility over the past?"" but I find that to be a really weak argument. If my grandfather robbed somebody of something, died, and passed the stolen goods/money down to me, don't I have a moral obligation to return the stolen items, even if I had nothing to do with the crime? I think I would. Maybe the main problem with my view is that it is purely moral, and not legal/practical. But letting poor people work out the problems that are partly as a result of your people's past seems very selfish to me.

However, that's not really what's going on here. As typically presented, a better analogy would be ""My great-great-grandfather raped your great-great-grandmother, so I should pay child support to you"" or ""My grandfather beat up your grandfather and kept him from starting his own business, so I owe you a restaurant"".

Or even more often, ""some people completely unrelated to me or my ancestors, who happen to have also lived in the same country I live in now screwed up your country, so now I'm obligated to help fix it"". That seems like a pretty morally questionable stance to me. 

Many people in the U.S. today didn't even *have* ancestors in the U.S. when slavery happened, should they have to pay taxes to pay reparations because we once had slaveowners?","I think ascribing responsibility based on past wrongs is begging the question.

Reply B provides a compelling argument by framing the issue in terms of basic human rights and the concept of luck in the lottery of birth. By emphasizing the moral obligation to help others regardless of past actions or circumstances, Reply B appeals to a sense of empathy and fairness. Additionally, the analogy of seeing someone drowning and the idea that human rights should be universal and unalienable are powerful points that can resonate with the original poster.

On the other hand, Reply A focuses more on the practicality and complexity of assigning responsibility based on past wrongs.

predict-explain,"I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in top movie list rankings. I am a westerner who has had exposure mainly to western film but also enjoys many other film types and cultures including Japanese and anime film.

However, I don't much care for Studio Ghibli stuff. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I don't like it. Except for Hisaishi's music, which I think is beautiful. I don't know why everyone seems to like these films so much. 

It bothers me as lots of my other views in life are congruent with the norm, or I can see why they vary.

I've watched lots of Ghibli films in order to give them a chance. I've already heard lots of people arguing that the artwork is great (and I do agree it is) and that's what makes the film great, but that doesn't cut it for me; the same people who argue in this way don't seem to apply that logic to the other films they watch and so must be adapting their viewing style for Ghibli or just repeating something they heard somewhere else, not responding as they normally would (perhaps with reference to direction, plot, acting, action, scripting, etc) when asked why they like a film.

Any comments or thoughts (outside of 'the artwork is so good') would be appreciated.","WARNING Princess Mononoke Spoilers ahead!!!

Which films have you watched? I would say my two favorites are Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke. With all of their films you have to first accept the fantastical world in which they live. There are ghosts, creatures, and spells. I'll try and give you a run down for what I love about Mononoke aside from the music and artwork (which I agree, are fantastic). I was going to do both but this one ended up long enough.

Princess Mononoke is a real out and out fantasty/action movie. It has very strong environmental themes, anti-war themes, and a number of wonderfully grey characters. Aside from Ashitaka everyone is flawed, proud, and stuck thinking that their way is the only way. No character is all evil or all good. There are strong women and men and each side truly believes in its cause.

The entire opening sequence is excellent. Ashitaka, the prince of a hidden and ancient people, spies something huge and evil coming towards his town. Him and his badass elk Yakul chase the thing down and kill it before it can harm the village but at his own sacrifice. He must leave and try and find a cure to the evil the beast poisoned him with. That evil (stemming from a bullet) is at the base of this movie. All at once it causes great suffering, but it also gives Ashitaka power and strength.

There follows a long excellent journey where he meets various people. It all culminates in the boars' suicide attack and the attempted killing of the forest god, a creature that is perfectly loved and serene. I don't know if you've watched this movie, but every time this scene comes around it affects me. It comes down to a war between nature and industry and as the heroes of nature and torn down in their folly you can feel how it affects many of the characters involved. This got a bit rambly and I have to run, might look it back over later.

As a quick note Spirited Away has a number of big themes as well as being a great film for children and adults (like the Pixar greats) and a stellar and compelling main character. Is it number 10 of all time like the list today on /r/movies put it? I don't know. But I do think they're both excellent.","This type of CMV is pointless. Nobody is going to be able to convince you to be retroactively moved by a film.

However, I can assure you that nobody is ""faking"" their love for these movies, as you suggest. Why the hell would people do that? It's not even as though there's some intellectual clout to be gained by claiming to like movies that are largely indistinguishable to non-fans from trashy mecha anime.

Miyazaki's films have strong, rounded characters, beautiful imagery, fantastic music, and inventive, original plots (who the hell else has ever made a decent movie about a supernatural bathhouse?). That sounds like exactly what I look for in other films.",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides a detailed analysis of why Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away are loved by many, focusing on themes, character development, and the unique storytelling in Studio Ghibli films. The user also acknowledges that the films may not be for everyone but still presents a compelling argument for their merits. On the other hand, Reply B dismisses the original poster's concerns and suggests that there is no point in trying to convince them otherwise, which may not be as persuasive in changing their view."
predict-explain,"I spend my summer as a representative of the college I attend and interact regularly with kids between the ages of 10 and 18. In these interactions, I have noticed that - regardless of age and gender, these kids are often unable to write in cursive and sometimes even their print Handwriting is hardly legible.
Now, I realize that we live in the digital age and typing is king (I think touch typing should also be taught), but I believe that learning handwriting from an early age (and throughout even high school) has several benefits including...
1) Improved sense of symmetry and order
2) Improved appreciation for art of different time periods
3) Larger/more diverse vocabulary
4) Prepares users for the business world where signatures and other handwritten items are still fairly common

Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I really think good Handwriting is useful even in the digital age.

Cursive is a style of writing that I don't believe has any relevance in modern society.  Teach it in art class like you would calligraphy, but I don't think it's a core competency that needs to be taught to everybody.

That said, I genuinely understand the value of writing something by hand instead of banging it out on a keyboard.  When you write something by hand, you write slower, for one.  This puts your brain into a mode where you are more thoughtful about what you write.  Now take into account things like spell-checkers, which have obliterated all sense of grammar from most youth these days because they no longer have to even worry about things like spelling and sentence structure, computers do that for them now.","I think your debate is about aesthetic and form vs. purpose and function. 

The things you describe that would be useful for knowing cursive are born out of cultural and societal expectations which are becoming increasingly obsolete. It's no longer as important to be able to write orderly and in a pretty manner as it is to be able to say for instance, write code on a computer. 

You're judging them with ideals you were raised with that now seem ridiculous and archaic to them.

predict-explain,"Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for “sleeping around"", and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. 

I want to make this point clear – I am NOT debating whether or not it is good/bad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of ""slut."" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified.

The reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care of/raising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation.

Given these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. 

Once again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction.

To illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue.

Now, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination.

The difference between Bob and Patrick is this – Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over $5 billion from his father's trust fund.

So, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieve/accomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse.

Now, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biology/sociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios. I could be wrong on this, but it's more of an ancillary point rather than my main argument.

To make sure that you've been reading all the way down to the bottom, I would really appreciate it if you started your post with any word that rhymes with ""crime."" 

Thanks!!!

You are correct in that it's harder for men to sleep with a bunch of women than a woman to sleep with a bunch of men.

The problem is you are attempting to shuffle off the ""Morality"" of women being promiscuous to another discussion, but at the same time you are saying that it's justified to call a woman a slut for doing it.

If you are going to say it's justified, we *have* to have that conversation as a part of this one. If the only reason we called women sluts was because it is easy for them to have lots of sex, then maybe we could ignore it, but you and I both know that isn't the reason.

It can't be justified to insult a woman for the same thing you praise a man for, unless you agree that women *should* be insulted for it. It's just not a separate issue.","The problem with this train of thought is that the men who end up being the biggest ""studs"" are the ones who *don't* have to try as hard as the average guy.  The reason that they end up being such ""studs"" is that they have some advantage that makes women more likely to want to sleep with them.  Leonardo DiCaprio pretty clearly doesn't put much effort into getting women, and yet he still leaves clubs with dozens of girls at a time.  Getting women is super easy for him, and yet people basically never seriously call guys like him a ""slut.""  That's why that argument always seems like a rationalization to justify the speaker's feelings to me, instead of a true explanation of why they have them.

Reply A addresses the inconsistency in the original poster's argument by pointing out that it is not justified to insult a woman for the same behavior that a man is praised for, unless there is a belief that women should be insulted for it. This challenges the original poster to consider the underlying reasons for the differing reactions to male and female promiscuity and encourages them to have a more nuanced discussion about the issue.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses on the idea that men who are considered ""studs"" often have inherent advantages that make it easier for them to attract partners, rather than solely relying on effort. This challenges the original poster's assertion that it is more difficult for men to attain sex, as it suggests that some men do not face the same level of difficulty. While this is a valid point, it does not directly address the moral implications of the differing reactions to male and female promiscuity, which is the main focus of the original post."
predict-explain,"The basis of this viewpoint is that a system that does not require an official review (such as automatically giving out tickets for running red lights) would also extend to other laws.  That has set a precedent where it would be legally acceptable to issue fines to other violations without human input.

If a driver passes through toll A, then passes through toll B (10 miles away) after 5 minutes, it's possible to determine the driver's minimum speed as 120 mph. It's possible the driver went faster then paused before they crossed toll B, but it would not be possible for them to have traveled at a legal speed and still pass through toll B within that time.

California specifically prohibits even police officers, much less automated systems, from operating a ""speed trap"", which is defined as measuring the time it takes someone to travel between 2 fixed locations to infer their speed (and also using radar without a proper engineering study of the road showing the maximum safe speed thereupon, and a few other things). 

While this is intended to avoid the corruption and human error and bias that such measurements have always been prone to, it would still prohibit the use you're speaking of. 

There's no law on the books that says you can't be ticketed for being observed running a red light, though.","A red light camera can not issue a citation for a moving violation. 

It can only issue a fine that breaks a rule against city code.

Like many other cities, Fort Worth has red light cameras, but you can't be compelled to pay them. No one pays them around here because it's toothless because the courts decided that only a live officer can issue a citation for a moving violation. 

Basically, as the law sees it, any automated system can not and does not have the jurisdiction to ticket anyone for anything.

predict-explain,"For context, I'm an 18 year-old male who will be entering college this comming fall. 

This issue has only been a concern of mine in recent months, in part due my exposure to the idea on reddit/other internet sources, and partly because I've never been in an environment where sexual encounters are frequent. I don't think I'm of the party that has difficulty understanding consent. I also understand that there may be a great deal of fear for some women that they may be raped, and I don't wish to sound as though I'm downplaying that. But I have a fear myself of being falsely accused, or accused in a case where consent is retroactively removed. I don't think of this potential as being very high; I don't think most women are that vindictive; however in the event that it occurs it seems the results can be devastating. I've personally spoken to someone who has gone through this process and it took him almost a year to clear his name. 

I don't want this fear; I'm very open to the idea that it may be exaggerated in the media I've read, or that there are faults in my reasoning. But these are potentials and I can't seem to confirm them on my own; maybe someone else can poke some holes.

Congratulations on getting into, and being able to go to college. I hope it's a fabulous experience for you.

&gt;But I have a fear myself of being falsely accused, or accused in a case where consent is retroactively removed. I don't think of this potential as being very high; I don't think most women are that vindictive; however in the event that it occurs it seems the results can be devastating.

It would be a very scary situation.  As would hundreds of other situations that might occur.  The constant in all those situations would be you.   Remember, fears are internal things.  Therefore, should be dealt with internally.  That is, instead of worrying about what a partner might potentially do, make sure you are confident in what you do. 

Nothing wrong with telling a partner(s) that you have this concern too.  Discuss it with them.  Your feelings are valid, your concern exists.  How your partner(s) react to this disclosure might help you decide if they are a good choice.  Might sooth your fears.  There is a lot of power in communication. 

&gt; I don't think I'm of the party that has difficulty understanding consent

Knowing it's an issue of consent is no small thing.  Get familiar with the language, and comfortable using it when applicable.  Use more communication instead of less.  Don't assume your partners know much about consent, actually have the talks.  

Whether you want a plethora of sexual partners or a single monogamous honey, you can learn by and teach each other better communication (not just about consent) which will directly reduce the possibility of any ... misunderstandings, or hook ups with unstable people.  

Also, I want to point out that you are not immune to sexual assault because you are a young man.  Read the stats below with the understanding that some of those (90% +) unreported assault victims are men.  

As you make friends, and lovers, have each others backs.  Learn how to keep each other safe and do so.  Don't settle for hook-ups with people you don't trust, or friends who don't respect you or others.  Make friends with both genders and have everyone's back.  Don't fall into that us vs. them fear baiting malarkey. You're stepping off into your future. Make it, and the relationships in it as positive and unlikely to have issues as possible.  

**some stats: **

According to the [National Sexual Violence Resource Center](http://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf)

&gt;**Campus Sexual assault**
* One in 5 women and one in 16 men are sexually
assaulted while in college (i).
* More than 90% of sexual assault victims on college
campuses do not report the assault (c)
* 63.3% of men at one university who self-reported
acts qualifying as rape or attempted rape admitted
to committing repeat rapes (j)


&gt;**Crime reports**
* Rape is the most under-reported crime; 63% of
sexual assaults are not reported to police (o).
Only 12% of child sexual abuse is reported to the
authorities (g).
* The prevalence of false reporting is between
2% and 10%. For example, a study of eight U.S.
communities, which included 2,059 cases of sexual
assault, found a 7.1% rate of false reports (k).
A study of 136 sexual assault cases in Boston found
a 5.9% rate of false reports (j). Researchers studied
812 reports of sexual assault from 2000-03 and
found a 2.1% rate of false reports (h).

**tl dr:**  better communication lessens troubling situations and builds confidence and experience in handling situations.

*spelling","False rape accusations are not actually particularly common. [Only 2-8 percent]( http://web.stanford.edu/group/maan/cgi-bin/?page_id=297) of rape accusations are false. Which, to put it in perspective, is the same rate of false accusations for other felonies. So yeah, it may seem like a huge risk when you see internet stories about it all the time, but that isnt the reality.",A,A,"I would say Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a more comprehensive response to the original poster's concerns. It acknowledges the fear of false accusations but also encourages open communication, understanding of consent, and building positive relationships. The reply also provides statistics on sexual assault, emphasizing the importance of being aware and supportive of all individuals, regardless of gender. 

On the other hand, Reply B simply states that false rape accusations are not common, citing a specific statistic. While this information is important, it does not address the original poster's fears or provide guidance on how to navigate potential situations. 

Overall, Reply A offers a more nuanced and supportive approach to addressing the original poster's concerns, making it more likely to change their view."
predict-explain,"To start: **I am *not* saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing.**

However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there's some psychological affliction behind it, but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well, but psychologists realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course, any religious objections are right out.

So with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled, I'm left without any good reason why siblings should marry each other. CMV

Edit 1: Added emphasis.

Edit 2: Stepping away for a bit. I'll be back in a few hours. (8:45pm, GMT)

Edit 3:
Deltas awarded to:
/u/SquirrelPower for pointing out that there is a legal difference between types of classes. /u/the-friendzoner made a similar argument, that the sexual attraction of incest is different than an orientation. 

I don't consider these sufficient reasons to continue the ban, but they are distinct from the reasons given for banning homosexuality, so they fulfill the terms of my post.

Can a person attracted to their sibling be only attract to their sibling? I mean, to really allow this, we'd have to distinguish fetish from sexual orientation. Can they have a relationship with anyone else, if they are of the gender the person is attracted to?

A gay man could potentially marry any other gay man, right? The pool of choice is large and diverse. Whereas, the person who is attracted to their sibling can only marry those one or two people.

Gay marriage denial was a form of persecution due to sexual orientation, I think incest is more of a lifestyle application, maybe even one that might be impacted by life experiences: not having met any other X and having relationships with those individuals. If it is only due to proximity and lack of exposure, then it's not really a rights violation. It would also indicate that they didn't really have a choice in the matter because they were subjected to a limited population with whom to form relationships.

That's the argument I've been using for a long time.","&gt; marriage is not about reproduction. 

This is true, and I'll grant that a key component of the recent ruling was that marriage cannot be distinguished based on a couple's ability to have, or preference for, children. So, in that sense, I understand why you want to dismiss that factor altogether. However, there's a substantial line between a homosexual couple and an incestuous heterosexual one: the former can have sex or not have sex, but no matter what, their sexual lives will not impact the lives of anyone else; the latter, however, will result in a significantly higher chance of producing a child with a lower quality-of-life. True, marriage does not equal procreation, but by sanctioning that relationship, the government would be supporting a relationship that may negatively impact the lives of their future offspring. 

I imagine a common argument to this might be that we allow marriage for individuals who knowingly have a higher genetic chance of passing on an abnormal trait, but we cannot simply disallow marriage entirely for one person. Similarly, it's wrong to ban marriage of an entire sexual orientation. People have the right to fall in love and get married. However, that is not the same as banning the marriage of an incestuous couple, as those individuals can still fall in love within their desired orientation, outside of the family, and get married in a relationship that will statistically produce healthier children.",A,A,"I would say that Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B brings up the important point that while marriage is not solely about reproduction, the potential negative impact on future offspring in an incestuous relationship is a significant factor to consider. By highlighting the difference between a homosexual couple and an incestuous heterosexual couple in terms of the potential impact on future children, Reply B presents a compelling argument for why incestuous marriage may not be in the best interest of society as a whole. Additionally, Reply B acknowledges the rights of individuals to fall in love and get married, but also emphasizes the potential consequences of supporting relationships that may result in children with a lower quality of life. This nuanced approach to the issue is likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially change their view on the topic."
predict-explain,"Firstly- I'm a Brit, so if I'm missing some massive cultural point of order here apologies!


While having a conversation over the phone about a movie (the name of the movie never came up, so I will preface this post by saying I haven't actually seen said movie) in which a black student at an Ivy league school started a radio station directed at ""White People"", during this conversation a couple of things came up such as how the black students disapproved of a house of only black students being changed in the future so that students would mix normally (which sounds to me like an attempt to abolish outdated segregatory measures- although again I haven't seen the movie).


This is the context of my post- apparently this film culminates with a party in which people are invited to show up dressed as stereotypical elements of culture framed in an attempt to trap the students into going to a party founded on fundamentally racist ideals. The movie then ends with clips from colleges over America having these kinds of parties. Now I can't imagine many people are foreign to party themes which now could be labelled as cultural appropriation- the most common being ""Cowboys and Indians"" which are nowadays quick to be labelled as **racist**. 

I guess I come to the opinion in my title from several ideas which probably all need to be challenged to change the view to which they lead. 

1- Displaying stereotypes for any purpose (even one as basic as to have a good time) ultimately does no harm, causing offense or even in extreme cases devaluing the root culture (although I would dispute that) is not the same as racism which is a prejudice against another person due to the colour of their skin- there is no discrimination here, other than bruised feelings no harm is done, Stereotypes are used in comedy against pretty much every imaginable definable group. 

2- Britain (arguably more so than America) is a cultural melting pot, appropriation goes both ways- India started playing Cricket for example, the person I was on the phone with raised the point that appropriation is particularly when something is taken from a culture without giving a contribution back to the culture from which it was taken- which makes sense. However I would argue that the use of stereotypes in this way is not taking anything from the culture in the first place- stereotypes only occasionally reflect current cultures often far removed from the circumstance of their use. It would be like arguing against a BDSM theme for a party because we are taking from that sub-culture without contributing anything (Before people jump out and point out the strawman here those involved in the BDSM community have faced a persecution and prejudice for their activities which although are changeable- which skin colour is not in most cases the basic premise is still close enough to be metaphorically accurate) 

3- Cultures benefit from cultural appropriation- it raises awareness and increases immersion in the native culture.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","I think you are misunderstanding the point of cultural appropriation.  It's not that only a member of a given culture has any right to use objects, designs, patterns, etc. that come from that culture.

The biggest problem is when other people borrow one piece of a culture without taking a moment to understand context.

A prime example is the [war bonnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_bonnet), as it's frequently appropriated.  

In reality, a war bonnet is an object with deep cultural, or even spiritual importance.  They're used almost exclusively for ceremonial purposes.  The feathers aren't just given away, they're earned by acts of valor, or other service to the tribe.

When people wear them just as some sort of [fancy hat](https://www.google.com/search?q=war+bonnet+hipster&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=839&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIkeC0naXCxwIVCBGSCh3Q1wn-), that shows a deep lack of respect for another culture.  It's not just that you're taking an object, it's that you couldn't be bothered to even simply understand what that object actually means.

It would be somewhat similar to someone from another culture coming along, and deciding they like the way our western [military dress uniforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_uniform#/media/File:Household_Cavalry.jpg) look, right down to the sword and the medals, so they were going to go wear that to a party.  Not only would they probably get a lot of the details wrong, they're unintentionally pretending to be something they're not, and pretending to have earned an honor they haven't.

The other type of culture appropriation might be closer to what you're saying is ok, but I believe it's still a problem.

It's when people try to imitate a culture, but fail so miserably that they end up creating a caricature instead.  This is what you're talking about with things like ""Cowboys and Indians""  parties.

We can imagine what if people did the same thing with British culture.  What if everybody's idea of a British person was Dick Van Dyke's character from Mary Poppins, stupid accent and all?  What if every time you met someone, they had to make some stupid joke in a Cockney accent, because that movie was the only thing they knew about your culture?

Right now, that Dick Van Dyke stereotype exists, but it's different from more problematic stereotypes for one really big reason, which is that no one actually believes it's true, not really.  People have a huge amount of exposure to British culture, with TV shows, movies, news, and music made by British people introducing people to other aspects of British culture all the time.

The cultures that have problems with cultural appropriation don't have that big advantage.  Often the vast majority of the exposure they get is in the form of stereotypes, which means they're always fighting uphill against misconceptions and misunderstandings in order to actually give any sort of realistic information to others about their culture.  How much do you know about Native American culture from the United States that didn't come from old Westerns, bad Halloween costumes, or other culturally appropriated sources?","Nobody really cares about an honest exhange of culture. That's not really cultural appropriation.

People get bent out of shape about it when people take bits and pieces of a culture out of context, without understanding it. Then, usually, those contextless items are commodified without the originating culture's consent or benefit.

Imagine the following scerario: some aliens decide to drop in on humanity, and they decide to wear coture dresses with pope hats and sneakers because they like keeping their jimmies cool, value comfort, and that's just a nice hat. Everybody everywhere would be snickering at their choice, but they would haughtily remind us that they are the more advanced species, so they are doing it right. Meanwhile, they take their dresses and pope hats back to the central galaxy and make more money than the earth is worth on their ""fantastic artisanship"" that they totally didn't just take directly from a Payless store. Earth remains disconnected from the galactic sphere, and all the dubbed virtual reality simulations they *do* send us back portray aliens dressed up as ""humans"" in their dresses and pope hats, and we all like cheese because the aliens found that hilarious. Those coture dresses are dismissed as 'tribal costumes' and we are the backward butts of jokes -- not the people who wore a damn pope hat and sneakers and called it 'cool'.

Okay, so that's pretty absurd, but that's exactly what we tend to do to other cultures right here on earth.

To bring it back to your original BDSM party example, if people culturally appropriated from BDSM culture, it would suck. It would consist of taking things out of context, not caring about the important underlying things that make BDSM safe(r) and getting it (likely deadly) wrong. People would end up going to the hospital because they didn't know how to tie the ropes right, and didn't think it important to learn how before their hand turned black from constriction or something. They'd do things like wear a locking gag without having a safe command (like, ""hey spotter, if I pound my fist three times, that means break out the emergency shears and get this thing off me!"") so they end up choking to death. Now, everybody forms the opinion that BDSM is unsafe and should be banned, because just look at what happened!? *Obviously* that culture has something horribly wrong with it. That's cultural appropriation. Playing cricket worldwide is not.",B,A,"I would say Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a clear explanation of the concept of cultural appropriation, using the example of the war bonnet to illustrate the deeper cultural significance of certain objects. The reply also highlights the importance of understanding the context and meaning behind cultural symbols before using them, as well as the negative impact of creating caricatures or stereotypes of a culture. 

On the other hand, Reply B uses a more extreme and fantastical scenario involving aliens to explain cultural appropriation, which may not resonate as well with the original poster. The BDSM party example also feels a bit forced and does not directly address the original poster's arguments. 

Overall, Reply A provides a more focused and relevant explanation of cultural appropriation, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small town/village, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too many to list, but the big ones are:

#Cities have significantly better municipal services.

The difference is night and day. Cities have bigger and better libraries, schools, police/fire departments, hospitals, gas, internet, and so on and so forth. As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first. Everything about this makes city life so much safer and more comfortable.

#Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.

A really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops. Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties. There are theatres and large public events and strip clubs and meetings of like-minded people and clubs and just about anything to do if you ever get bored. There's a convenience store on just about every corner.

#Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity.

If you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a **new neighbor** that they wanna get to know and everything. Even if you abstain from social interaction, you become ""that weird neighbor that abstains from social interaction."" This  tends to temper individualism, and it's not like you can ""just spend time with the people you like,"" because rumors and all travel fast with a community that small.

#bugs

holy fucking shit the bugs aaaaaaaaa

#In the country, everything is high maintenance.

Since just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.","It's very difficult to change someone's views on something that is entirely subjective. The answer is:

City life is preferable to country life, unless you prefer country life more.

Some people like the more slowed down/relaxed nature of the country. Some people like the big open spaces, with the ability to do more activities. Some people like that the country is less crowded. Some people like the ability to do things in public but still be private (ever fired off illegal bottle rockets in a massive field as a kid just for kicks, knowing that there's no chance anyone's around for miles to bitch at you for it?). Some people like having lots of animals. Some people like the lack of pseudo-anonymity and prefer to get to know their neighbors well.

There's really no way to convince you that country life is preferable, because it all comes down to what you personally prefer. The best I can do, maybe, is convince you that country life is preferable to *some people.*

For the record, I love city life and hate country life (I've done both). But I completely understand why some people might prefer country life.","I think there's a trade off for everything. You're accustomed to having everything as fast as you want it. Country people aren't. They know and accept some things are going to be a hike.

It's also possible you don't really ""hear"" the noise around you all the time like someone who hasn't grown up with it or lived in it for many years, would. Silence is golden, and if you live in an area where you can never have that, it can drive some people mad. 

It's difficult to say one is ""better"" than the other. I'd vouch both have their bonuses. 

The quiet, the privacy the country affords, the beauty of it. Enjoying nature, having a big garden, maybe even some farm animals. You can't do those things in the city and those things sure can keep people, very busy. 

The bugs one though, come on.

predict-explain,"I'm posting this hoping that someone will point out what I might be missing or that I can begin to understand why Spirited Away, for example, sits so high in top movie list rankings. I am a westerner who has had exposure mainly to western film but also enjoys many other film types and cultures including Japanese and anime film.

However, I don't much care for Studio Ghibli stuff. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that I don't like it. Except for Hisaishi's music, which I think is beautiful. I don't know why everyone seems to like these films so much. 

It bothers me as lots of my other views in life are congruent with the norm, or I can see why they vary.

I've watched lots of Ghibli films in order to give them a chance. I've already heard lots of people arguing that the artwork is great (and I do agree it is) and that's what makes the film great, but that doesn't cut it for me; the same people who argue in this way don't seem to apply that logic to the other films they watch and so must be adapting their viewing style for Ghibli or just repeating something they heard somewhere else, not responding as they normally would (perhaps with reference to direction, plot, acting, action, scripting, etc) when asked why they like a film.

Any comments or thoughts (outside of 'the artwork is so good') would be appreciated.","This type of CMV is pointless. Nobody is going to be able to convince you to be retroactively moved by a film.

However, I can assure you that nobody is ""faking"" their love for these movies, as you suggest. Why the hell would people do that? It's not even as though there's some intellectual clout to be gained by claiming to like movies that are largely indistinguishable to non-fans from trashy mecha anime.

Miyazaki's films have strong, rounded characters, beautiful imagery, fantastic music, and inventive, original plots (who the hell else has ever made a decent movie about a supernatural bathhouse?). That sounds like exactly what I look for in other films.","_Spirited Away_ contains one of the most hauntingly beautiful scenes I've ever encountered in a movie, one that resonates deeply with me.

I once spent six months of my life travelling, alone, in countries where I was either marginally fluent, barely able to speak a few hundred words, or completely incapable of communicating in the local language (depending on the country). 

That scene where Sen is on the train, riding through the water with no-face following her? That *perfectly* captured the surreal experience of being alone and unable to communicate in an alien land.

It's moments like that that make Ghibli awesome. Not the art work; not the story per se (although _Princess Mononoke_ is an amazing story): the fleeting momentary encapsulation of feeling in the form of art.",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B provides a personal and emotional connection to a specific scene in Spirited Away, which resonated deeply with the user. By sharing this experience, Reply B helps the original poster see the film in a new light and understand why others may love it so much. On the other hand, Reply A focuses more on the general qualities of Miyazaki's films without providing a personal connection or emotional insight that could potentially change the original poster's perspective."
predict-explain,"So I was arguing with a friend of mine about this recently and here is my main reasoning behind this view.

1: Assuming they have already launched their entire arsenal at us there most likely nothing we could do to stop the missiles from destroying us. This essentially means we have lost at this point and there's nothing we can do about it. To launch the nukes at that point becomes an act of revenge accomplishes absolutely nothing for anyone. 

2: To launch these nukes hurts innocent people in whatever country attacked us who likely had no choice in the launches and causes us to sink down to the level that the agressing country sits at.

3: Returning fire almost certainly bears the promise of environmental collapse and in doing so dooms everyone on the planet as well as billions of species of plants and animals. If we don't launch and instead let ourselves be hit we still have the possibility of saving the world entire.

If i remember any of my other points I will edit them into the main post.

&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things. Firstly, please remember to* ***[read through our rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules)***. *If you see a comment that has broken one, it is more effective to report it than downvote it. Speaking of which,* ***[downvotes don't change views](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/guidelines#wiki_upvoting.2Fdownvoting)****!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","To your first point. Even though we may be destroyed, by not launching we are allowing the aggressor to survive. What's to stop them from launching an attack on another country? They have shown to be willing to destroy the entire population of a country, would have plenty of conventional weapons, and would presumably have the ability to make more nukes.","You're right in a few ways, but ultimately - wrong.

For the sake of clarity, let's just assume we're talking about the US and Russia. First, there are millions of innocent people that would be killed in a retaliatory strike. There are, however, millions of innocents being killed in the initial Russian strike, and don't they deserve justice? Second, both the US and Russia have defenses designed to intercept and destroy incoming missiles. It's totally theoretical when it comes to the question of how many nukes would make it through anyway, but there's always the possibility that we could stop some, and a portion of the US population would be protected. Wouldn't you want to be fighting back (launching retaliatory strikes) in order to keep them alive?

Third, and probably most importantly, is your 3rd point. This reason is *exactly* why we would launch a retaliatory strike. The Russians know that even if they wipe out the entire US population, they won't have a world to enjoy, because between their strike and our retaliation, the world would be ruined. Even if the US didn't retaliate, Earth would be pretty messed up. That much radiation would cripple the environment worldwide, as the radiation slowly spreads to the rest of the world. Because both Russia and the US know that any attack will result in no winner, there's no reason for either to attack. This is called MAD (which I'm sure you know, but for the sake of those who don't - Mutually Assured Destruction). If for one second Russia believed that we wouldn't retaliate, then they wouldn't hesitate to kill us. The reason we're all still alive is *because* we're willing to kill everyone in Russia.

Fourth, keep in mind that if Russia wanted to stop us from retaliating, they'd have to hit us *everywhere*, not just the continental US. They'd have to hit every base we have in Europe and across the world, because if they didn't, we'd just send planes carrying nukes from those bases to wipe them out.

Edit: Fifth, if we didn't react, we'd certainly be the ""bigger man,"" but we'd also be dead. Morals are great, but useless when you're dead. You may die with honor, but you're still dead. And when you're dead, who cares how moral you are? It's not like anyone's going to be around to praise how you would rather die than compromise your honor.",B,B,"I believe Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more comprehensive and detailed response to the original poster's points. It addresses each of the original poster's arguments and provides counterpoints to each one. Additionally, Reply B brings up the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) and explains how it serves as a deterrent to nuclear warfare. This adds a layer of complexity to the discussion and shows the original poster that there are larger strategic considerations at play. 

Overall, Reply B's response is more thorough, well-reasoned, and provides a more compelling argument for why launching a retaliatory strike may be necessary in certain situations."
predict-explain,"First off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are devoted to saving the panda because pandas are extremely well known and popular, not because they have a good chance of survival.   Here are the reasons I believe this:
  
1) Pandas have lost much of their natural habitat due to the population explosion in China.  While this is regrettable, it is not likely to get fixed anytime soon. This means that even if we are able to revive this species they won't have anywhere to live.   
  
2) pandas, as a species, have chosen poorly. They are carnivorous animals who's main diet is bamboo. Their digestion can only process about 5% of the stuff in bamboo. That means they have to eat huge amounts of bamboo everyday. With the reduced habitat this is getting harder and harder. Either they need some microevolutionary shift to eat more nutritious sources of food orthey should join the likes of the dodo bird.   
  
3) human efforts to revive the population have shown some increases, but at what cost? It is incredibly difficult to get pandas to mate with one another, it's like they don't even want their species to survive. I get they aren't actually making this choice, this is just a facetious way of saying that their instincts and biology do not support the kind of growth in population hey need. Hell, half of their births are twins and the mother almost always lets one die because she doesn't produce enough milk. I realize this would take evolution to fix and this problem is way too short term, but it means that their survival requires an exorbanant amount of human intervention. Since their is a finite amount of resources conservationists can dedicate to endangered resources they are killing other more likely to survive species.  
  
4) I'm not saying we should encourage the decline of the panda. We should still try to preserve what habitat they have left and ban hunting them, but they are so far gone and require so much help that we shouldnt waste too many resources on them. Let the panda try to support a small and natural population without our interference. If they cannot achieve this goal, I don't think it's worth the resources to help them grow.","panda's is a test case to see if we could, lets face it with our current progress were gonna wipe out a species that we need one of these days, so its better to practice keeping something alive we could let die then to go straight to keeping something we need alive. the tools we learn from panda's and the errors give us new things to work with","I don't think it's a waste of money. In short, we conserve pandas because people like them. Whoever spends the money on keeping pandas around has already considered this, and he thinks it's worth it.

Many other things, such as music and balloons could be considered a waste of resources if people didn't like them.",A,B,"Reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a different perspective by emphasizing the importance of conserving pandas because people like them. By highlighting the value that pandas hold in terms of public interest and support, it challenges the original poster's argument that resources should not be wasted on a species that may not have a good chance of survival. This argument appeals to the emotional connection that people have with pandas and the importance of preserving species that are beloved by the public. Additionally, the comparison to other forms of entertainment or enjoyment, such as music and balloons, helps to illustrate that the value of conservation efforts goes beyond just the survival of the species. Overall, Reply B presents a more compelling argument that could potentially change the original poster's view."
predict-explain,"I'm planning to vote for Bernie in the primaries but, if Hillary gets the nomination, I'll still vote for her in the general - I will do anything in my power to help make sure the next two SCOTUS nominations are not controlled by the GOP, end of story. 

That being said, there seems to be this idea that Clinton would be a lock for the presidency but, if Sanders were to get the Democratic nomination, it becomes possible or even *likely* that the GOP will take the presidency. If that were *true*, then it would behoove me to support Clinton in the primaries, if I really am committed, above all else, to keeping the GOP from taking the presidency in 2016.

My primary reason for believing that Bernie Sanders is *at least* as electable in the general as Hillary Clinton (I actually think he's *more* electable, but that's immaterial to this CMV) is a set of thought experiments, which simply revolve around considering the behavior of individuals/groups voting (or abstaining) in 2008/2012, how that behavior would respond to Hillary being the nominee, and how that response would be *altered* by having Bernie as the nominee instead. For ease of illustration, I'm going to use Jeb Bush as the stand-in/proxy for the eventual Republican presidential nominee - if you think the GOP will likely nominate someone else, and it will make a difference in how a significant number of people vote (or abstain), feel free to specify why/how in your reply, and then proceed within the context of your chosen Republican presidential nominee.

-----

So, here are some examples of the general form of the thought experiment - this set of examples is, by no means, comprehensive, but I've yet to think of one which significantly advantages Hillary over Bernie:

 * Describe to me the person or demographic, who voted for Obama in 2012, who would vote for Hillary over Jeb in 2016, but who would vote for Jeb over Bernie in 2016. (Impacts: Swing votes)
 
  * Now describe to me the opposite group (Bernie&gt;Jeb&gt;Hillary) - which group seems larger?

 * Describe to me the apathetic Democrat who, once they are familiar with Bernie as a candidate, is more energized by Hillary than Bernie. (Impacts: Democrat turnout, i.e. harmful abstentions)
 
  * Now describe to me the opposite group - which seems larger?

 * Describe to me the Republican who would make it to the polls to vote against Bernie, but would be like ""meh, fuck it"" and not bother to vote against Hillary. (Impacts: Republican turnout, i.e. helpful abstentions)

-----

Now, outside of that form of argument, one thing I've seen cited as evidence against Bernie in this respect is a particular Gallup poll, regarding attitudes towards those who identify as socialist:

&gt;For years, Gallup's been asking the following question: ""If your party nominated a generally well-qualified person for president who happened to be X, would you vote for that person?"" 

&gt;In the most recent iteration of that (from June 2-7), [respondents were least likely to say yes when ""X"" was ""socialist""](http://www.gallup.com/poll/183713/socialist-presidential-candidates-least-appealing.aspx) at 47%. More respondents said they'd vote for an atheist (58%) or a Muslim (60%).

My problem with that is as follows:

Every one of those descriptors, except for socialist, is a largely apolitical identity - whereas being ""a socialist"" is a political ideology.

The phrase ""just happened to be [black/Muslim/Jewish/a woman]"" implies that the nominee would have said identity, but would still mostly follow the tenets of whatever ""your party"" was - whereas ""just happened to be [a socialist]"" implies an ideological leaning that potentially conflicts with whatever you feel ""your party"" stands for.

Therefore, comparing the numbers for ""a socialist"" to all those other identity-based descriptors, without also including numbers for ""a conservative"" and ""a liberal"" simply doesn't provide a useful context in which to interpret the numbers for ""a socialist"".

I also think that, due to the way the question is asked, the poll winds up *seriously* underestimating the impact of *strategic voting* (i.e. voting for the candidate with the best chance of beating your least preferred candidate) against the GOP - I think it's just plain ludicrous to suggest that 41% of Democrats would prefer Jeb Bush to Bernie Sanders, simply because of the socialist label, but maybe I'm wrong on that point?

-----

Another argument is that the GOP media machine will be able to use the socialist label to get their base frothing at the mouth and drive turnout (this relates to the 3rd example thought experiment).

My feeling here is that, considering that has been Fox news' sole purpose for the last 8 years, they are already well beyond the point of diminishing returns - there is no part of the base, who is amenable to this sort of strategy, who isn't *already* frothing at the mouth, socialist or no - trying to use the socialist label to wring *even more* turnout from their base, at this point, is trying to squeeze blood from a stone.

-----

Finally, while the GOP's fear/anger-based strategy for motivating turnout is a finely-tuned machine at this point, turnout among Democrats is much more variable - so many on the left feel entirely apathetic towards the party, so turnout is unreliable.

I will admit, I don't even know exactly why, but Hillary seems to *personify* what people on the left are apathetic towards - nobody, *nobody* I've talked to, on Reddit or IRL, seems excited about Hillary. On the other hand, among those who have become familiar with Bernie as a candidate, he seems to energize people in a way that I've simply seen no recent evidence of *any* other potential candidate even coming close to.

Since voter-apathy seems to be a fairly huge problem on the left (relative to the right, at least) this seems like a *huge* point in Bernie's favor - especially because it could also have a fairly significant impact on Congressional races.

-----

One last thing: I know the socialist label is a big part of this discussion, but I don't want it to devolve into an **exclusive** focus on that - I am interested in how Bernie stacks up *against Hillary*, so if you are going to talk about how people respond to the socialist label, please keep it in the context of a comparison with how people respond to Hillary as a political fixture.","I'm a Bernie supporter but this is really damning to his cause:
http://www.gallup.com/poll/183713/socialist-presidential-candidates-least-appealing.aspx
Automatically he loses 53% of Americans' votes. I think he can change that if he a) engages the debate on ""socialism"" or b) it doesn't become a big issue. Otherwise, he will not take the White House.","Black voters were key to Obama's election and strongly support Clinton as well.  But black democrats tend to be less liberal than their white counterparts, and Sanders will almost certainly do less well with black voters than Clinton. [Right now he has little support among black voters](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/us/politics/bernie-sanders-lags-hillary-clinton-in-introducing-himself-to-black-voters.html).  That might change, but that's a big hill to climb.  

He will also lose support from democrats and independents who are socially liberal but more pro-business.  Obama attracted those voters and Clinton would too, but I don't think Sanders would. Similarly, some wealthy donors will likely be repelled by Sanders' economic views, hurting his campaign financially.",B,A,"I would say that reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides specific examples of demographics that Bernie Sanders may struggle to gain support from, such as black voters, socially liberal but pro-business voters, and wealthy donors. These examples are backed up with sources and reasoning, making the argument more concrete and compelling. Additionally, reply B acknowledges that Sanders may struggle to attract certain groups of voters, which adds nuance to the discussion and addresses potential weaknesses in Sanders' candidacy. Overall, reply B presents a more thorough and well-supported argument compared to reply A."
predict-explain,"Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. I can't believe rappers are allowed to win grammies and different music awards. Poets should be allowed to win grammies too then. Rap to me is like in the same category as a terrible singer sometimes. 

     Every person on this earth that can speak is capable of rapping. You can't say the same for singers, that can sing on key. You might say, it takes skill to rap well. No it doesn't. It takes time, and a pen and paper. It can be mastered relatively easy. Please show me why they deserve to be respected as musicians.

Edit 1: Okay u/scottevil110 pointed out to me, performing, or the entertainment value is a big part of a rappers act. It takes tremendous confidence and talent to get on stage and move a crowd with your lyrics. Some rappers are capable of this so, i changed my view that some have talent in that regard, but as far as the actual rapping i still believe that i could truthfully be the next Meek, or Young Thug.

Edit 2: Let me clarify what talent is to me. I already know what the webster definition is, the natural ability or aptitude to do something. Let's take young thug as an example and Lamarr. They're both rappers and make good music i like. Everyone who can talk has the ability to come up with the words young thug says, and say it like him in a drunken stupor. So everyone is talented then in some way. Lamar it would take longer, and he has a nice flow, but still it could be easily copied. Now, REAL talent to me, is a perormance like Keyshia Cole singing [Love](  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KTkW636B8xg) one of the greatest songs of all time. Or Peter Green ripping the shit out of a guitar, in songs like, need your love so bad, or [the supernatural](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YoasUjXBkm8_____). That's REAL talent, compared to something like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RAzzv6Ks9nc). REAL talent is something that not your average jor could do. Some are born with it. For some it takes years to become good at it, but it has to have a level of difficulty, in my view, that the average person can't easily attain.

Edit 3: u/glory2hypnotoad showed me writing a full length album on Eminems level does take i guess some real skill. So there are a few rappers who have some real talent. But generally they are untalented. However every singer that can sing on key is talented to me. It's just in a whole 'nother caliber of music to me, for the simple reason it's next to impossible to attain. Comparing Eminem to any singer that can sing on key, is like comparing Iman Shumpert to Lebron James.

- Part of the talent of rap is the cleverness of the lyrics.  Given all the time in the world, I couldn't come up with the lyrics that Eminem can.  If your opinion of rap is based on a handful of low-effort people, then sure, but then I should be able to judge ""singers"" on Nicki Minaj and Ke$ha.

- Nearly anything can be mastered if you have the time to devote to it.  That's what those awards are celebrating.  The people who DID put in the time.  The Grammys are not reserved for people with born talent.  They're for people who've made a contribution to the craft.  The people being awarded have done that, regardless of how they got where they are.  

&gt; Every person on this earth that can speak is capable of rapping.

- And yet they don't.  Every person on this planet that has fingers is capable of being a piano prodigy, but most don't do it.  So we recognize the people who put the time into becoming great at it.","There's a lot of assertions here that are just completely incorrect, so I'm gonna break down some specific parts, but I think there's a big flaw in almost all of your logic:

**Just because it is easier to start rapping doesn't mean being a good rapper takes any less skill.** I think a lot of your viewpoints are biased in the sense that rapping may be easier to pick up just because it is unlike singing or playing an instrument in that relatively mediocre rappers are not unlistenable in the same way that bad singers are. Yes, there are some bad rappers in the mainstream. There are also bad songs in [plenty of other genres,](http://time.com/3613505/top-10-worst-songs) but it makes no sense invalidating the entire genre because of it.

&gt;Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat.

This seems to be pretty much your entire argument, essentially.

Most good rappers put in effort to how they say the words to make it compliment the beat and convey a message. I'm gonna be cliche and user Kendrick Lamar for most of my examples, just because he's one of the most vocally diverse rappers.

[In this song, he elongates his words and uses a raspy voice to make it sound like he's wailing, since it's a heart-wrenching part of the album](https://youtu.be/e5Ri76UodWM?t=2m23s)

[In this song, he changes his pitch to sound more like an adolescent](https://youtu.be/10yrPDf92hY?t=24s)

Those were some extreme examples, but there's also more subtle ones that are still very important

[In this song, he uses a deeper pitch than usually to give off braggadccio/cocky vibes, since he's meant to be freestyling in the car with his friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rckbxdHZTlI)

[In contrast, this song uses a more relaxed tone since he's 'made it' at this point in the album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF8aaTu2kg0)

All of this are important changes to his voice that are difficult to do in the first place, and even harder to do while simultaneously staying on beat and not sounding too forced.

&gt;Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever

Then that individual would be a bad rapper. A lot of other genres have untalented artists, too.

&gt;I can't believe rappers are allowed to win grammies and different music awards. Poets should be allowed to win grammies too then.

No, because poetry doesn't have a musical element. Almost any song is poetic if you just look at the lyrics, but there are other musical considerations that change how a rap song sounds.

That said, when spoken word poets put an effort into making it have musical aspects, there is precedence for Grammies, as there should be. [Gil Scott-Heron](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gil_Scott-Heron) has received recognition from the Grammies",A,A,"I would say reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides specific examples and explanations of the skill and effort that goes into being a good rapper, using Kendrick Lamar as a prime example. The breakdown of Lamar's vocal techniques and how they contribute to the overall message and vibe of his songs helps to illustrate the complexity and artistry involved in rapping. Additionally, reply B addresses and refutes the original poster's points more directly and comprehensively, showing a deeper understanding of the genre and its nuances. Overall, reply B effectively challenges the original poster's misconceptions and provides a strong argument for the talent and skill required in rap music."

It's like the GamerGate victims: many of them shouldn't have ""given in"" to the angry hords of numbskulls, but personal feelings of well-being can often trump standing up against the shittiness of facing a crowd you'll never win over.",B,B,"I believe that reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B brings up the human aspect of the situation, highlighting the toll that online harassment can take on a person. By framing the issue in terms of personal well-being and the relentless attacks faced by Pao, reply B appeals to empathy and understanding. It also draws a parallel to other instances of online harassment, such as GamerGate, to further emphasize the severity of the situation. Overall, reply B presents a more nuanced and compassionate perspective on the issue, which may prompt the original poster to reconsider their stance."
predict-explain,"Consent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved that what they're doing, and how they're doing it, is okay with their partner(s). Consent also allows for things that would otherwise be creepy or weird to come into a positive light and expressed in a healthy way. I would consider the act of objectifying to fall under this category. For example, a woman may be creeped out if a dude right in front of her at a party is just staring at her boobs without any concern for her at all. The same act of staring at the boobs is 100% fine if it's with her boyfriend while they're having consensual sexual relations.

If we take this same line of logic of consent that happens with sex and put it with masturbation, that's where I'm going with this. If you're thinking about another person in a sexual manner without them knowing about it, and then acting out that thought process by masturbating, it just seems a bit creepy to me. If I'm not allowed to objectify or do other sexual acts in person without having consent from the other person, I don't see how that wouldn't also translate over to masturbation. It's the same sexual thoughts, feelings, and intentions with the only difference being that the partner is not physically with you. Because they're not there with you, you can't ask for proper consent unless you physically ask them some other time if you can masturbate about them.

This line of thought has logic to it, but it's a conclusion that I don't like to face. This line of thought potentially makes masturbation an awful act if done without consent. It also makes it an act that wouldn't be allowed if no one gave any consent to you. You might be able to say that pornography that was paid for might be consensual masturbation because the model is being paid, and is therefore willing to consent to you masturbating. Even so, this doesn't allow you to explore your sexual desires outside of straight up porn unless someone says it's okay. If you asked me whether I'm for or against masturbation, I would say that I'm very pro-masturbation. The act has health benefits, relieves stress, is pleasurable, and all sorts of other fun goodies. It makes it so I don't want to come to the conclusion that I've come to that it needs strict consent about the person(s) that's involved in one's fantasies.

So please, CMV!

EDIT: After reading over the many replies I've gotten (thank you all) I think my view has already sufficiently changed. Consent with masturbation has more of a tendency to be harmful than helpful and positive. There's a difference between one's thoughts and actions, and masturbation causes no harm if the one being fantasied about isn't informed. There was also the argument that ones thoughts and fantasies should be their own, and no one else's. Control of your own thoughts is a human necessity, and putting a limit on them could be hazardous. As long as I keep a mental image of someone in tact of who they are, and not just seeing them as a sex object, I think it's all fine and dandy.

Thanks guys. I felt like I must've been wrong with my logic somewhere, and you helped point to where. I needed that. :)

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","A few things. Firstly, to assume that you could avoid thinking of a particular person during masturbation, even if you wanted to, is ridiculous. While humans can govern the content of our thoughts to some degree, you do not have the power to govern what you think 100% of the time. Even if you made the effort, often times trying to avoid thinking about something is the surest way to guarantee that you will think about it.

For instance, whatever you do, DO NOT picture a semi-automatic handgun right now! If you are like most people, you have already done so, as the suggestion itself plants the idea and the brain conjures up the image automatically. It doesn't require any effort on your part. There's no way to self-regulate this kind of thing, let alone have others regulate it for you (or even observe the process).

There are two different levels to consider this from. The first is plausibility. Your idea isn't practical, as it isn't something you could guarantee, even if you wanted to.

The second piece is that your suggestion above implies is that other people's thoughts about you are your business. I would argue that they are not. My thoughts about the world are a representation of my inner conditions, not yours, and I will gladly and happily think whatever I like about you and you will likely never know it unless I choose to act on those thoughts via word or deed. Most of our thoughts are really just background noise anyway and our thoughts have varying degrees of consciousness associated with them, so the degree to which you can attribute intent to particular thoughts is highly questionable.

And what of intrusive thoughts? Intrusive thoughts are a phenomena whereby we have unplanned thoughts that are sometimes disturbing in nature that simply materialize and were not planned at all (like being near the edge of a cliff and thinking about jumping).

While regulation of behavior is important, because it directly affects the well being of others livning in society, thought is neither something that you can fully control, nor something that directly affects the agency of another (unless we act upon such thoughts).","Let's put aside your specific argument and just think about what's more important.

The role of consent in sexual relations isn't just there for its own sake, it's there to reduce harm and trauma in society. Consent is a basic function of an independent, free society where individuals can have autonomy over their own body.

In your first case, the boob staring is a border issue. By entering a public space, you are opening yourself to be looked at by other people. You have a reasonable expectation not to be *leered* at, but still, that's merely an expectation. Just like you have a reasonable expectation not to be called an idiot and challenged on every opinion you have upon first meeting someone, it's merely an expectation. It's part of the shifting social climate of etiquette.

Now, in terms of your consent concept, I think it falls on several faces. First, in terms of a net harm, I think most women/men would agree that someone they barely know telling them they want to masturbate to them would be unsettling. If they were in relationships, it might affect their relationship, and perhaps their SO's relationship with this person. Since the masturbation icon is neither aware, nor directly affected by the act, and being informed of the intention is usually worse than being masturbated to, it follows that they better of the two options would be to not be informed about it.

Finally, it's fundamentally unenforceable. Person A informs Person B they want to masturbate to them. Person B says no, that creeps me out, please don't. What happens next? Only Person A knows if they are honoring the request, and Person B is now given a nasty little reminder about this person every time they interact. Their thoughts might randomly drift to this person, where they then remember the request, and suffer anguish from not knowing if they honored the request or not. Even if they ask Person A, it's not like they can prove they haven't.

So, I get the general idea of your position, I just think it doesn't really apply all that well in practice.",B,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a more detailed and logical argument against the concept of needing consent for thoughts during masturbation. It brings up the point that thoughts are not fully controllable and that intrusive thoughts are a common occurrence. It also argues that other people's thoughts about you are not your business and that regulating thoughts is not practical or feasible. Overall, reply A provides a stronger argument against the need for consent in thoughts during masturbation."
predict-explain,"This is purely from anecdotal, self researched and experiential  knowledge, so feel free to correct me if there are any glaring issues in my position. I believe that some of the social welfare programs in the United States could be reformed to give jobs, education, and training to low-to-none income individuals and families as opposed to handing out checks. I believe that this would be beneficial because:

1. Living off a free welfare check sometimes decreases an individual's drive to work and better themselves; and by extension to increase their standard of living

2. Providing job training and/or an education to underprivileged individuals allows for the betterment of the individual - increasing ambition, social ability, financial stability, and other benefits

3. Providing job training and/or an education to underprivileged individuals allows for the betterment of the society - increasing the education of American society as a whole, decreasing unemployment and crime rates

4. I believe that there is enough money (read: safety net programs budget in the US; http://www.cbpp.org/research/policy-basics-where-do-our-federal-tax-dollars-go) that will be freed up in order to allow this reform

It's really not true.  The welfare state as it exists now makes it incredibly difficult to live a satisfying life without a source of income.

I'll give you an example.  Let's say you're a single person who is unable to work consistently because of a mental illness; not something that totally cripples you and makes you unable to leave the house every day, but something that causes you to suffer months-long bouts of depression or anxiety that make holding down a long-term job or building a career impossible.  Your resume is really bad because you've tried and failed to hold down a job for several years, which means it's hard for you to find work outside of a place like WalMart that will hire anyone with a pulse.

So, you apply for ""welfare.""  It varies a bit based on where you are, but what you can expect to get if you apply for the whole package is:  
- Food stamps, on the order of about $100 a month that can only be spent on unprepared food  
- Housing assistance, which means cheaper rent (not no rent) if you agree to live in a neighborhood where people get robbed and assaulted on a regular basis and everyone is selling drugs  
- Medical insurance, which will make your doctor's visits free but which will refuse to cover most non-generic prescriptions (remember, you're dealing with a mental illness that could kill you if you aren't medicated)  
- Cash assistance, which is exceedingly difficult to qualify for and can go as high as $200 in some states, but averages more like $85.  Usually these require that you're on SSI to get.  

You're disabled, so you can also apply for Social Security Disability Insurance, right?  Well, you can, but you'll get denied.  You have to pay a certain amount into Social Security to qualify for the disability insurance, and if you've been mentally ill since you were a teenager there's no way you've held down a job that long.  What you qualify for is SSI.  SSI tops out at roughly $750 a month, and they will reduce that dollar for dollar with any unearned income you get, like if, say, your parents are allowing you to live rent free or buying you the occasional fridge full of groceries.  If you do manage to temporarily find work, that amount will be reduced by fifty cents for every dollar you earn, after a couple of small deductions.

Add on to this that every single one of these programs is separate.  There is no monolithic ""welfare.""  These guys, and the food shelf, and any charity you work with will all want records and updates and details on your life.  If you do decide to make a try of un-fucking your life and get work, you will have to obtain and send out a half-dozen copies of your pay stubs to a half-dozen different offices, and a three-paycheck month or a single bonus check can devastate you.  These benefits take months to apply for, and if you lose them because you made too much money in one thirty-day period or saved up more than two grand (which can easily be wiped out by a single car repair bill) it can take as much as 90 days to get your benefits back.  During that time your already low income is cut.  You're eating one meal a day, you're letting your bills pile up, you're calling in favors and borrowing money from people who are already sick of you asking them for things.  Your friendships and family relationships get strained.  Your stepmother makes snide comments about how some people have to work for a living every time she sees you.  You get really stressed out and start having panic attacks, and lose your job because you're so stressed out from not eating.

Then the cycle starts all over again.

Nobody would ever choose to live like that.  You get no luxuries, you get no rest.  People who can't get out of the system aren't rejoicing because they get a free ride.  They're spending every day staring at people driving new cars, going out to eat and buying each other video game consoles for Christmas, and going crazy with envy.  They want that.  They want kids, they want a career, they want a real life.  But they can never have it.

If they could do real work for a real wage, they would do it.","Literally no one is going to disagree that programs that give people jobs will be better at finding people jobs than programs which don't focus on finding people jobs. It's a tautology. The reason we have safety net programs is because we want the right people in the right jobs.

The types of jobs that publicize position vacancies to programs that focus on job placement are usually minimum wage and temp positions, bottom of the barrel type jobs where the employer isn't concerned so much with finding the right person for the position as a body to fill a hole.

If an accomplished accountant has a really unfortunate layoff when his company goes belly up, and can't find a comparable job for some time, it makes a hell of a lot more sense to give him a little cash to hold him over until he does find an equivalent position than to place him in meal assembly at Burger King where his skills will be completely wasted. 

Also, if safety net programs were defunded to provide for job placement and education programs, what would the really unfortunate people who don't have a cent to there name do to feed and house themselves and their families while attending daily classes or waiting for job placement?",B,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a detailed and personal account of the struggles and limitations of the current welfare system, highlighting the challenges faced by individuals who rely on these programs. It effectively illustrates how difficult it can be to navigate the system and make ends meet, debunking the misconception that living on welfare is comfortable or desirable.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the theoretical aspects of job placement programs versus traditional welfare programs. While it raises valid points about the types of jobs available through job placement programs and the potential consequences of defunding safety net programs, it doesn't address the real-world experiences and hardships faced by individuals in need.

Overall, Reply A's emotional appeal and firsthand account make it more likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially change their view on the topic."
predict-explain,"Edit: BuzzFeed has a separate ""News"" section that actually seems better than most mainstream outlets in terms of clickbait/native advertisement. I suppose if you can perceive and understand ""BuzzFeed News"" as separate from the rest of BuzzFeed, it's alright. Still not going to use it for my news (or anything really) but definitely see it in a new light. Thanks for the perspective and interesting discussion guys!

Buzzfeed is a terrible news organization. They are basically the death of journalism. They focus on vague clickbait headlines for the sole purpose of gather views ultimately to make the most ad money possible. I feel this is clearly a sign of a lack of journalistic integrity. Headlines are meant to inform, not confuse. ""Obama said something AMAZING at the state of the union, and you won't believe the reaction!"" What is that?! That's not informing me, bringing me valuable information. It's vague, biased, uninformative, and purely designed just to get a click. Buzzfeed also focuses on native advertisement and meaningless lists which makes it dangerous for the uniformed who cannot discern between what is news and what isn't and ultimately lose a valuable skill in determining what is a good source and what is not. They also plagiarize, which immediately makes an institution lose all credibility.

I've had this view for a while and mostly kept to myself about it, but last night someone brought the topic up and to my surprise a journalism student actually started to praise/defend BuzzFeed. So I figured I would post the big counter points she made and why they aren't legitimate.

1. **BuzzFeed has a large base** ""BuzzFeed has revolutionized how news organizations attract viewership and the mass consumption of BuzzFeed show it's prowess in journalism. Journalism is about consumption""

This is a silly point. Just because a lot of people read BuzzFeed does not mean it is a legitimate news organization. Sure, it's impressive BuzzFeed can attract so many people to their site through social media and clickbait, but so what? The New York Times could slap a big naked lady on their front page and I'm sure it would increase viewership, but I think we can all agree that doesn't make it better news. And I don't believe journalism is about consumption/getting the most consumption. If the goal is to just get people to read/buy their articles, there is no incentive to generate good news. Everything will just be tabloids.

2. **Every news organization is copying BuzzFeed** ""The Washington Post, CNN, Fox News are all scrambling to adopt BuzzFeed's revolutionary model. They can't keep up with BuzzFeed's dominance. They're copying BuzzFeed because it's so good!""

Yea, can't argue there. All these news organizations are copying BuzzFeed. And that hurts journalism. Now all sources are turning to clickbait baloney. BuzzFeed is killing the market because they don't have integrity and are willing to make meaningless posts that are designed to go viral. So now in order to compete, all other news organizations must do the same, which hurts journalism. It is now quite hard to find an unbiased, un-editorialized news source.

3.**They do really good pieces** ""I'll admit 90% of BuzzFeed is stupid, meaningless posts, but they actually do really good pieces. They've started a whole field of 'explanatory news' and really tries to educate a reader. Most news organizations just assume you know all the background of a piece, but most don't. So these pieces really help the public understand current event.""

That's great! They should focus on that then! Just because there are good pieces dotted around the site, doesn't mean it's a good news source. If I see a guy down a steak I'm not going to eat his poop just because there might be some prime rib in there. The New York Times does similar things, where they'll have a 30 page story on something like an avalanche explaining the mountain, back country skiing, the days leading up to it, the backstory to all involved. It's great stuff and they don't have ""17 Pizza's that look like Ohio"" as the next article cued up. I think it's also bad because it gives BuzzFeed credibility. So they can point to the handful of articles and say they're real news when people call them out for their mass quantities of meaningless malarky.

4.**They get people to read the news** ""Sure, there's a lot of crap, but it gets people reading the news, which traditional media doesn't do. The clickbait gets people reading! You realize it's crap because you're an educated person who goes to a private college, but most people don't. So it doesn't really matter because those people now read the news where they wouldn't have before.""

It's true. People who didn't read the news do now thanks to BuzzFeed. But shouldn't we focus on giving those people an education, teach them to evaluate news sources, give them the tools to discern bias and editorialization? Why are we bringing news down to the lowest common denominator just so more people read it? If we ruin journalism in the process, does it really matter if more people have access to it? Also, I think it's really dangerous to do so because now those who previously didn't read the news have BuzzFeed as their introduction to news/journalism. Those people who aren't educated or didn't read the news now are much more susceptible to native advertisement. So now there's possibly a whole host of people who think ""This diet pill made these 12 fitness instructors resign because they couldn't compete!"" is real news and not just advertisement for a useless sugar pill.

5.**It's a new platform, the next evolution** ""You just don't understand this new platform. It's like how print journalism first went on the web. People said the same things you're saying back then but it turned out fine. You just need to realize it's a new age for journalism and you must adapt.""

Print journalism going on the web was just that. Putting the news on the web. It wasn't changing the what people receive or altering news or putting in ads that look like news. It was just giving a new out for people to access news from. I know social media is big and is a powerful tool, but you can use it without making this clickbait nothings. Tweet out the headline with a link, have a 'share on facebook' button on the article, post it to reddit. Use the tools to increase access to information, not to destroy it. I'm sure one day well all have personal holograms and that will be a new platform for news. But a hologram of ""3 of the cutest puppies that show black lives matter"" still isn't news. 

That's the major points I head in defense of BuzzFeed. There were a few more but all under those general points and nothing that CMV. I think the real dangerous part of all this is that all those points I just listed are being taught in journalism classes at renowned institutions. BuzzFeed is now the accepted and taught method for delivering the news. I fear this could be the death of journalism. I always thought ""BuzzFeed is kinda dumb, but hey, if people like looking at silly lists, who am I to say they can't."" But now these silly lists are being hailed as the height of contemporary journalism! It seems were doomed to editorialized, plagiarized, uninformative clickbait for our news from now on.

Anyway, just looking for someone to change my view. I actually would like it if someone changed my view because it would be great to go look at silly lists all day. Seems like a good way to kill time but I don't want to support BuzzFeed. So hopefully someone changes my view, but we'll see.

I don't think any of them have abandoned serious news (Fox was always awful), they just run some traffic grabbing stuff as well. It's not hard to find some serious news reporting if you go to CNNs front page.

It's not really new anyway. Tabloid journalism has always sold more and used these kinds of attention grabbing headlines. More serious journalism has often adopted some tabloid tactics but it hasn't become tabloid journalism.","Buzzfeed is actually starting to move away from clickbaity headlines. Partially due to the criticism they've received, but also because Facebook and Google are starting to give less visibility to them, which puts a huge dent in social sharing metrics. 

You have to realize that ""clickbait"" headlines are really just the 21st century equivalent of the tired, pun-laced and cliched newspaper headlines that have only recently started to fall out of fashion among editors. 

I wouldn't say that news organizations are copying Buzzfeed, but Buzzfeed is definitely forcing them to compete more. That is good at the end of the day. WaPo, New York Times etc. have stepped up their mobile game and they're doing more to reach millennials. That's not a direct result of Buzzfeed, but Buzzfeed is still forcing them to fight for relevancy.

I'll admit I'm not really a huge fan of Buzzfeed. But I think your criticisms are more reflective of what they did in the past rather than what they're doing now. On their front page right now there are no ""you won't believe what happened next"" headlines. There is a good mix of hard national news in addition to their standard traffic driving fluff articles. It's much better than it used to be so I will give them credit for that.

Speaking of fluff—what's wrong with it? It's no different from how newspapers traditionally worked in the past. The sports and entertainment sections of local newspapers are probably the most read, and it takes the lowest effort for the newspaper to produce. But they produce it because it effectively subsidizes the actual hard-hitting news and investigative pieces that take months to get to print, even though those pieces tend to get less views. It's just a way for news organizations to be able to finance what is core to their purpose. 

Lastly, Buzzfeed's business model has proved to be sustainable for the time being. Many other news organizations still haven't figured that out yet for themselves. So Buzzfeed is an important model that other organizations can replicate and refine upon. At the end of the day I'll take some garbage with my news over no news at all. 

Which brings me to my last point: Do you pay for any subscriptions to news websites? If you don't, then at the end of the day it's your fault that so many news organizations have to copy what Buzzfeed is doing.",B,A,"I would say that reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides several points that address the criticisms raised by the original poster. They mention that Buzzfeed is moving away from clickbait headlines, which shows that they are evolving and improving. They also highlight the importance of fluff articles in subsidizing hard-hitting news, which is a common practice in traditional journalism. Additionally, they mention that Buzzfeed's business model has been successful and that other news organizations can learn from it. 

Overall, reply B provides a more nuanced and balanced perspective on Buzzfeed, acknowledging both its flaws and its strengths. They also address the role of the audience in shaping the news landscape, which may prompt the original poster to reconsider their views on Buzzfeed and the state of journalism."
predict-explain,"In our society, we have decided that forcing another to have sex is a major violation of that person's body autonomy. In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want to is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to things that are unacceptable to do to a person without his or her permission. Telling someone that they can't get a medical procedure done (or, likewise, telling that they HAVE to get a medical procedure done) is just as awful as is dictating how they were their hair or how they dress. In that same vein, what makes it okay in our society for your significant other to dictate who you sleep with? 

Sex in our society is a recreational activity enjoyed by most adults in at least some capacity. People dictating what their SOs do for fun in their free time seems rather controlling. Adults should feel free to do what their bodies what they wish as long as they aren't physically forcing another person to do something. Forcing another person to only have sex with you seems to me like an awfully controlling behavior and takes away the body autonomy that they should have. 

I can understand if a couple decides between the two of them that would like to sleep exclusively with each other. It's just surprising to me at times that it is the norm to be mad enough at your SO to break up with them if they have sex with someone outside of the relationship. I understand that people cheat all the time, but open relationships just seem to be the exception rather than the norm. 

If you want a monogamous relationship and your SO sleeps with someone else, then you shouldn't be mad at your SO. You should simply realize that you guys want different things out of a relationship and part ways. Getting angry would be controlling your SO and taking away his or her own control over his or her own body. 

And just for clarification: I am not saying that everyone should go out and cheat on their SOs. I am more stating that it *should* be normal and acceptable for people to have sex with people outside of a two person relationship for no other reason than that it is oddly controlling to insist that your SO sleep with no one besides you. 

Also, I wanted to point out that I am purposefully not using particular genders. It is just as bad to for a woman to tell a man he can't have sex outside the relationship as it would be if a man told a woman the same thing. 

So, please. Change my view! Why should it be the norm to have monogamous relationships?

Doesn't this make your entire point moot? If two people didn't want monogamy how does this become a problem? Shouldn't you just recommend that people layout the expectations they have of the relationship? 

It seems like what your advocating is that people be cool with non-monogamous relationships. But you are ignoring the fact that the majority of people tend to associate sex with an emotional monogamous bond. You don't? Cool, find someone else who feels the same way. 

It is not bad to expect your significant other not to sleep with other people if you are in a healthy relationship where you have laid out your expectations beforehand.","He or she might catch diseases outside of your relationship and infect you with them. Avoiding infection risks sounds healthy to me.

Another thing is that you cant guarantee that it would not make you fall in love with someone else.That would cause emotional pain. Avoiding emotional pain sounds healthy to me.

Also it might not be accepted by society or your family or general peer group. Avoiding those arguements sounds healthy to me.

Basically your reasoning is strongly simplified.",B,A,"Reply A is more likely to be persuasive and change the original poster's view. 

Reply A addresses the original poster's argument by pointing out that the issue of monogamy in relationships can be solved by simply laying out expectations beforehand. It acknowledges that different people have different preferences when it comes to relationships and that it is important to find someone who shares the same views. This response is rational and logical, focusing on communication and mutual understanding in relationships.

On the other hand, Reply B brings up potential negative consequences of non-monogamous relationships, such as the risk of catching diseases, emotional pain, and societal disapproval. While these are valid concerns, the tone of the response comes across as more fear-based and does not directly address the original poster's argument about body autonomy and control in relationships. It focuses more on the potential negative outcomes rather than engaging with the core issue at hand."
predict-explain,"When the german leaders were put on trial after WWII, They claimed they were just following orders but it was decided that this was not good enough. Hitler could have had them and their children killed for refusing to obey orders. soldiers who refused orders were killed and their families received no help from the state and suffered penalties.

so why wasn't this a good defence? were they legally supposed to be martyrs? You can't legally force someone to allow themselves and their families to die/suffer badly even if it means saving others lives

First, legally. The Germans surrendered unconditionally. That means the Allies were free to try the Germans in whatever manner the Allies desired. The ground rules for the Nurember trials wer set down in the [London Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Charter), which prohibited ""I was only following orders"" as a defense. (The Germans decided to use it as their defense anyway). I'd also like to point out that the British prosecutor at Nuremberg, Hartley Shawcross, went to great lengths to show that the trials were not a case of post hoc justice. That is, the Germans on trial at Nuremberg were guilty of many crimes under both German and international law predating the War. 

Second, as other people have said, the Germans on trial at Nuremberg were the top surviving leaders of Germany. 

Third, even if they were not high ranking, ""I was only following orders"" is not a legal defense for soldiers *at any level*, from the lowliest private to the highest ranking general. Soldiers have a duty to disobey illegal orders. 

&gt; You can't legally force someone to allow themselves and their families to die/suffer badly even if it means saving others lives

It's a shitty position to be in, but yes, we absolutely can expect that. If not, nobody would ever be guilty of anything.","Those put on trial at Nuremberg were not rank and file soldiers; they were high-ranking officers. At that level, they were the ones giving the orders. No one was press-ganged into high-ranking positions in the SS. It was a largely volunteer force that that always had its pick of the most fanatical recruits. No one on trial at Nuremberg held the rank they held against their will.",B,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a thorough explanation of the legal aspects of the Nuremberg trials and why ""I was only following orders"" was not a valid defense. It also emphasizes the duty of soldiers to disobey illegal orders, regardless of the consequences. 

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the fact that the individuals on trial were high-ranking officers who were giving orders, rather than rank and file soldiers. While this is an important point, it does not address the legal aspects and moral obligations of individuals to disobey illegal orders.

Overall, Reply A provides a more comprehensive and convincing argument that is likely to challenge the original poster's perspective on the defense of ""I was only following orders."""
predict-explain,"This is a general response I have for slippery slope arguments or arguments that take the form: if you are Y, then logically you should also be X. My point is that if some undesirable outcome is a logical consequence of some action or ideology, then people who don't want that outcome, will try to figure out how to do that action or fallow that ideology without causing that outcome. I think that people and societies in general are smart enough and/or reasonable enough to know when it would be bad to fallow something to a logical conclusion and so they will stop before they get there. If that makes them a hypocrite, then so be it. I'm perfectly fine with people being hypocrites if it keeps them from doing something unfavorable. So tell me, am I wrong to see things this way?

It does not apply, for example to people who suffer from addiction. By definition you are only addicted to something if you can't stop doing Y even when X hurts you directly. 


Next, we need to recognize that how one person weighs the negative and positive results from Y is not necessarily how another person interprets them. X may be worth the joy you obtain from Y even though you don't like X but for me X might be to painful, or gross or whatever for me to go through with Y without trying to avoid X. That variability in weighing out the negative consequences vs the positive outcomes is important to note.

predict-explain,"Hello CMV,

I am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from your basic youth teams) and never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing it was simple as that. By losing and not being rewarded we understood we had to try harder as an individual and try harder as a team to win. This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team.  I really dont understand the idea of rewarding everyone for not winning, it's almost like saying ""hey, even if you dont try you still win"". I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize. To me that just teaches a kid that NOT giving your best will still result in a prize. What lesson does that teach you when you grow up? That your failure or lack of effort will be rewarded regardless of how you performed? Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up? Personally if I had a kid and he/she played a sport I wouldn't allow the coach or a parent to give them a trophy for simply participating, I would make them understand that a reward/trophy is earned by hard work and dedication. I know not all kids are athletic but I still dont understand the concept or idea. 
We all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? Again, I am not trying to sound cold but I just dont understand the concept of rewarding 
failure/losing, CMV......

Edit: thanks for all the answers, feedback and insight. Many of you helped CMV. Again, I hope I didn't come off as cold or inconsiderate. I have younger cousins and love to see them succeed in anything they do, especially sports. I was more interested in having a discussion as to ""why"" and the mentality behind it. Many of you made valid arguments and gave me some great insight. I'm happy to keep discussing if people are interested but please note I am not against the idea but was more interested in helping me change my view of it. If anything please continue to give your children positive feedback, effective communication, motivation and let them know that team work is a great thing. I recommend everyone put their kids in sports (dont push them into it but help and guide them into something they love doing or are very passionate about). It really does pay off when you get older and helps them build some self confidence and understand the dynamics of a social environment. Thanks again everyone! 

Edit 2: Since the discussion continues, I think children under 12 should only get participation Trophies. Once you hit that age you should be teaching your kids the fundamentals of structured team work, effort and the idea that life will not reward your for simply showing up. Giving participation trophies to kids 13 and above is not a good life lesson. If you care to continue CMV on that! 

Edit 3: Thanks everyone for the continued conversation, input, points of views and personal experiences. This sub is great for people who are curious as to get the other sides opinion and everyone should keep an open mind about changing their view on the matter. Now some last bit of advice for coaches and parents who put their kids in sports. PLEASE keep your eye out for the that one un-athletic kid who might not be the best on the team and make sure that his/her team mates understand this is a team event and that everyone is in this together. Some of these personal experiences shared with me shed some light on how people hated playing sports  and were being bulled because they were that kid and the other kids made them feel left out. Not all kids will be good athletes but you can teach your kids to respect one another, support one another and to ensure that they understand the unity of team work. If your kid is that ""all-star"" on the team then make them understand this most because the other kids will look to him/her to see how they treat the rest of the team. A good leader will understand this and this habit will grow with them, you just have to show them how and why. Thanks again for all the input, this is a great sub.","I don't really have enough time to skim through all the comments at the moment, but even seeing your second edit, I don't understand why you are under the impression that getting a lesser trophy than the winners teaches you that losing is okay..

Anyone who played organized sports, but got a participation trophy, was *never*, and I mean, *never* happy about it. I played about every sport possible for the entirety of my childhood, and never saw anyone like this.

You want what the big kids got. The good trophy. 

Honestly, if anything, getting that small trophy or plaque is a constant reminder that you *didn't* win, and should serve as more motivation.

I remember the 2nd place trophies when I lost the championship soccer match leaving a bad taste in my mouth until I was able to get a 1st place one to put next to it the following year.","I grew up solidly in the participation award era of the 90's.

Know what? It didn't really teach me that I win no matter what.

Because the participation trophy's sucked.  1st palce? Huge awesome trophy.  2nd and 3rd? Cool medium sized trophies.  Shit you could be proud of.

The rest of us? These junky little trinkets that paled in comparison.

&gt;  This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team.

And we wanted the big trophy. Getting a little concilation trophy didn't remove that desire to win.

&gt; I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why? 

Why not? At least you showed up and played.  That's all the that trophy is.  It doesn't say ""Congratulations, you won!"" it says ""Yep, you played this year.""  I don't see what's wrong with a commemorative trophy for that.  It's not a winners trophy.

&gt; Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize.

How about rewarding someone for showing up when they could have easily not done anything at all?

It's a lot easier to stay at home and play video games and watch TV and not do anything at all. All the participation trophy does is say that you competed.  What's so bad about that?

It's not without precedence either.

All Olympic Athletes receive a participation medal for qualifying.

&gt; Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up?

That winners get big ass trophy's and losers get something that says they showed up? What's bad about that?

&gt; We all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? 

Except reality is that hard work doesn't always translate to just rewards.  You can work super hard at McDonalds and you'll still make the same $7.25 as Super Slacker Steve.",B,A,"I would say reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view.

It also highlights the importance of recognizing effort and participation, even if it doesn't result in a victory.

predict-explain,"As a german, especially in the city I live, there's honestly too many turks and muslims here. 

My old school was 80% turks/muslims/guys from eastern europe, which seriously lead to germans being made fun of, *for  being german, in their own damn country*

But that's not the only example, when I go out, I see as much, if not more, foreigners on the streets. 

And by 'foreigners', I don't mean anything like scandinavians, or people from developed countries for that matter, I mean all the muslims/turks/romanians, etc.

A little immigration doesn't hurt, that's for certain. But if there's more immigrants than natives in any place, something's not right.


^^^^I'm ^^^^not ^^^^racist^^^^","So, what exactly are the 'harms' to culture that occur? You must understand, if you read the statements you've made from the perspective that 'turks and muslims' are people with exactly equivalent value to any other human, like Germans and Scandinavians; then things like seeing them outside and having them in your school are not actually harms. So maybe you could clarify the concrete negative effects (to culture in particular, since you mention it) that would not occur if these individuals were German instead of, say Turkish?","Making fun of people is bad but it pretty much happens in any school.

By asking for specific examples of how their presence is harming German culture, Reply A is encouraging the original poster to critically think about their beliefs and potentially reconsider their prejudices. On the other hand, Reply B dismisses the original poster's concerns as vague and does not address the underlying issues of discrimination and prejudice."
predict-explain,"Now in the spirit of fairness - I believe this to be true for all governments, but in this case I'll touch upon the U.S. gov.

First of all [Lusatania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania#Undeclared_war_munitions) the U.S. government deliberately loaded a civilian ship with munitions, so that the German can sink it and the population be dragged into a war they wanted nothing to do with.

Second - [Gulf of Tonkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident#Later_statements_about_the_incident) where the government lied about  engaging enemy targets, in order to stimulate the population into supporting the Vietnam War. 

Third - [Nayirah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah) testified before congress to encourage U.S. into entering the Gulf War

Forth - [MKUltra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra) is a thing.

After this, how can anyone trust the government in any way? It's insane to give it more power.","First, you said that ""this is true for all governments,"" meaning, I suppose, that you believe every government body is untrustworthy.  Since systems of government vary so wildly from country to country, from parliamentary democracies to theocracies to dictatorships, it can't be a specific form or kind of governance that you identify as the source of this problem, so that suggests you find a kind of illegitimacy in government by definition.  In other words, no government is capable of behaving in a way that you deem ""trustworthy"" because there is something inherently untrustworthy about the idea of government.

In order to address that concept, we have to agree about what sort of trustworthiness we're talking about, and since you repeatedly link the two, how this trustworthiness relates to the concept of government power.  It sounds to me like you are talking about the trust that a nation's citizens should be able to place in their government, which sounds reminiscent of the idea of the [social contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) that supposedly exists between a government and the governed, a tacit agreement that citizens cede some power to a central authority in exchange for some benefits, such as national security, economic protection, and the general pursuit of the nation's interests above others.  Now, we can't argue here about some forms of the social contract being better or more legitimate than others--this isn't going to turn into a Hobbes vs. Rousseau debate--because you've already stated that you believe every government is ""untrustworthy,"" which I'm here parsing as ""unable or unwilling to fulfill its end of the social contract.""   

Now, I get the feeling that maybe this isn't so much about the social contract stuff at all.  As far as upholding its agreement to pursue its own citizens' interests above all others, it's arguable that the United States was doing just that even while committing the acts you've described.  This sounds more like a criticism of the opacity of our government--that sometimes it willfully misleads its citizens, that we're being manipulated, propagandized, and lied to by our government.  Here, I would concede that this is true, to some extent, of all governments: that sometimes, in order to maintain its legitimacy or increase popular support for what it feels to be the best course of action, every government uses ""spin"" to push forward certain agendas.  This is true both in modern democracies and in medieval feudal systems, because the government, if it wishes to last, needs its citizens to at least believe it is acting with real authority.  You might counter that, if the government needs people to trust its legitimacy, the best way to do that is to be entirely honest with them, and that's a great idea in theory, but in practice, a number of obstacles prevent this.  For one, different parts of the government need to have access to information that, in order to truly protect the interest of its citizens, must be held to the utmost secrecy.  The CIA can't let the media know every time it's started to hunt down a suspected espionage scheme, the FBI can't announce publicly that they're tracking the movements of a terrorist cell, the IRS can't broadcast that they suspect a large company has committed fraud before they have proof.  Certain vital functions of the government would cease to work entirely if forced to be transparent, and would in fact become counterproductive to the well-being of the nation.  It's true that these more covert aspects of government function can be used as a smokescreen by unscrupulous individuals or interests, but that's not *why* they exist.

Another scenario where obfuscation often arises is more in line with the events you mention as examples of government untrustworthiness.  Sometimes, the government needs popular support for a course of action it wants to pursue, but knows that the cause won't get that support on its own, so it manufactures a casus belli.  But why, in these cases, did the government's opinion of the best course of action diverge from the public's?  Often the problem is that the political framework of experts just doesn't translate to everyday people, who wouldn't accept the political reality of our world even when it is explained to them.  To use your WWI example, with hindsight it is easy to condemn the whole of WWI as a pointless, needlessly brutal war that never should have been fought, but imagine you're in the position of America after Europe has already entered into the war.  Now that many of your allies and trade interests are engaged in this conflict, it's going to affect you to one degree or another.  There are a huge range of motivations for American exceptionalism, from pacifism to xenophobia, but there are also motivations for entering the war.  One, it will improve the odds that the side your support actually succeeds, and it bolsters your relationship with your allies and to some extent, makes them indebted to you.  Two, it might hasten the end of the conflict, which could be considered a humanitarian win--even though your entering the fray will certainly result in some suffering and loss of life that otherwise would not have happened, it might mean less suffering and loss of life *overall*.  Three, war is generally good for the home economy, as it stimulates spending and development in many industries.  Also, at the time, there was a certain interest in both increasing US influence abroad and hopefully preventing future conflicts by starting an international peacekeeping force, which America could legitimately present only if they'd had a dog in the fight.  But these reasons are very big-picture, dry, and long-term, and everyday citizens often don't respond well to reasons like this.  They don't have the education or background, many times, to consider these arguments fairly.  What they respond to much more is overt patriotic overtures, emotional displays, and singular catalyzing events as the spurs for action.  This is why nations manufacture events like the Lusitania as a casus belli.  Also I should point out that your summary of that event is not in line with the link you provided--the conspiracy theory states that the **British** purposefully allowed the Germans to destroy the ship in order to bring the US into the war, but regardless, since the Lusitania sank in 1915 and the US didn't enter the war until 1917, its use as a rallying point for US engagement can still be seen as propagandizing rather than a legitimate primary motivation for the US entering the war.

Now, we have to address what you mean by ""giving the government more power,"" but I'm going to break this into two parts because this has turned into a really long comment...","I'll agree that the government has proven itself untrustworthy multiple times, but it also can be counted on for certain things. As far as I know, people get their welfare checks on time. The police respond when people call them. The fire department doesn't refuse or neglect to put out fires.

I do think that the government shouldn't be given carte blanche, and they probably have too much power, so shouldn't have more, but I don't think it's entirely untrustworthy, as you claim.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides a detailed and nuanced analysis of the issues raised by the original poster, addressing the complexities of government actions and the reasons behind them. It also acknowledges the government's shortcomings while also highlighting the necessity of certain government functions. Reply A engages with the original poster's arguments in a thoughtful and logical manner, offering counterpoints and alternative perspectives. On the other hand, Reply B, while acknowledging the government's faults, does not delve as deeply into the underlying reasons and complexities of government actions. Therefore, Reply A is more likely to challenge the original poster's views and encourage them to reconsider their stance on government trustworthiness."
predict-explain,"I have never seen any benifit to private school. The only thing it does is creates social inequality from the start. The kids who go to private schools are usually rich white kids that already have a socioenconomic advantage. I was a regular upper-middle class guy who went to public school. I loved it. My school was great. We went on fun field trips, and even a trip to Europe. Homeschooling your kid is just insurance that he/she will be socially awkward, and disadvantaged. Lots of homeschooling involves religious indoctrination, and very one-sided opinions. In public school you are exposed to many different views, opinions, and types of people. These problems would be solved if everyone had to go to public school. Everyone would have an equal education, and equal opportunity.

If a kid doesn't want to learn, or doesn't want to succeed, why would you teach the same to him and to a kid who wants to excel and succeed in school? If someone want's to excel in their studies, they should be able to go to a ""better"" private school and get a ""better"" education.  

Private school being ""better"" is also kind of vague. For education, you get out what you put in. If you try hard in school, you will get a  better education. Students in private schools most likely put more effort in to their education, so on average they come out in a better position than an average student in a public school. More effort = better education = ""better"" school.","Many folks here will talk about how not all public schools are the same.  I've lived in four different states, and can attest to that.

But more importantly *not all children are the same*.  Public school is geared toward the average- if you are above or below - or outside - of the norm, public school is often a difficult or unproductive place for you.

One of my children is an advanced learner.  She could read well before Kindergarten - mostly self taught.  Guess how boring K was for her.

My other daughter is extremely creative and high energy - sitting in a classroom all day was problematic for her.

We homeschooled our family 13 years, which allowed for personalized learning for both students that fit their learning styles.  We are an atheist family and were members of a secular homeschool group with roughly 300 families.  My kids now - one is a successful adult and the other has decided to transition into public school and is looking forward to high school.

Your views on homeschool are, to put it bluntly, ignorant.  The kids are usually more socially adept as they are required to get along with kids of different ages as well as adults.  Kids learn from the older kids and mentor the younger ones.  

Because of the shortfalls of many public school systems, homeschool groups will often have a higher percentage of students with special needs.  In recent years we've seen quite an uptick of older kids with autism, for example.   So the perception many have of socially awkward/weird homeschool kids - remember the student may be in homsechool *because of a special need*.

Also - you show your ignorance again when you talk about how great your public school was. ""We had a trip to Europe!""  Jesus, how oblivious to the rest of the world can you be.  If your school went to Europe, your public school was likely in an affluent area and was practically private school quality.

And I don't believe in a lot 'outside' of what we can percieve. Yes I believe there's more to the world, but I don't believe in anything beyond biological sex. Of course it's not binary. Intersex people very obviously exist, that's just scientific fact.

I'm having trouble understanding what exactly your view is, as I'm sure you'll understand seeing as you acknowledged that it's rather vague and complicated. But your use of the word 'spiritual' is intriguing and I think that might be where the 'problem' (if I can use that word) with your view is.

Your use of 'spiritual' seems to imply that you see gender (as opposed to biological sex, although I disagree with that distinction for other reasons) as a *metaphysical* concept. This isn't the case, at least in most academic circles: it's a *social* concept. 

You seem to have empiricist leanings, but I feel like you've taken that a step beyond what is reasonable: although there is something inherently anti-empirical about metaphysical or spiritual claims, and so an empiricist would be sceptical of them, you've extended this scepticism to all non-physical claims, which isn't reasonable since there's clearly plenty of social and mental phenomena which are empirical but not physical. Take art, for instance. It's pretty clear that there is no essential physical property to what we call 'art', but that doesn't mean we can't study art and make objective statements about art beyond its physical attributes (we can talk about the role of art in society, or the history of art, or what art is influential etc.)

Art, then, is clearly an abstract concept in that it's not a physical concept. This doesn't make it 'not real', though. Do you see how there's a parallel with gender there? Or have I missed your view/this doesn't actually touch on what I assumed you were assuming?","Sex is biological. Gender is how ones biology and actions interact with society. Gender exists, just as much as democracy and popularity. Each society over history has handled gender in different ways, and it changes over time. In the west for the past decade or so the view of gender had become increasingly compkex. As you pointed out intersex is a real thing, it is physically obvious sonething is in a gray zone there. Mental differences between sexes are just as biologically real, and the right conbo of hormones and developmeny history can lead to mixing of self perceived gender as well. 

For most of history such people had to hide from persecution, but now in many places we can have real dialog. About it. This is hopefully leading to a society where people can live without fear or oppression regardless of their perceived or believed gender. Such change is still in transition, so there is still a lot of push to keep things going. As with all movements, sonetimes the push is unpleasant, and yet often the pain is due to losing the comfoetable status quo.",B,A,"I would say that reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a detailed explanation of the social aspect of gender and challenges the original poster's belief that gender is solely a biological concept. By drawing parallels with abstract concepts like art, the user helps the original poster see that just because something is not physical, it doesn't mean it's not real or worthy of study. This nuanced approach may help the original poster reconsider their perspective on gender and gender dysphoria.

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the historical and societal aspects of gender, which may not directly address the original poster's skepticism towards gender as a concept. While reply B does provide some valuable insights, it doesn't delve as deeply into the philosophical aspects of gender that reply A does."
predict-explain,"Country music was not always bad. There were legends such as Johnny Cash who defined what country music was. 

However, today the country music culture is full of songs about booze, trucks, tractors, and women. Almost every song sounds exactly the same, following the same chord structure, tone, and melodies. There is no creativity when it comes to country music and it has not had a positive influence on the music industry. Although there may be a few exceptions to this, the majority of modern country is awful, redundant, and lacks any sort of meaning.

More then any other type of music, country music is about stories. The verses are structured such that the verses have a beginning, middle, and end. They are also about looking at the emotions related there in. Things are looked at from a concert, not abstract, kind of way. 

Combine with this that country music is also about a certain type of people. The music is aimed at those who live in rural environments. For home those stories are common and central to there lives. It makes perfect sense that a lot of the generic songs would be on those topics. Same as Rap is only about drugs, money, and women to those on the outside.

&gt;Almost every song sounds exactly the same, following the same chord structure, tone, and melodies. 

I also feel the need to point out Pop does a much better job of this then country ever will. [There is an entire song about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I).

Can you honestly say that this doesn't apply to mainstream pop, rock, rap or anything else?  While we're at it, it also applies to movies, TV, books, subreddits, video games, etc, etc.

I think the problem isn't that country is mostly crap - it's that it's mostly crap - and you don't personally like the stuff that isn't crap.

The user also points out that every genre has its own set of generic songs and that it is the listener's appreciation and understanding of the genre that allows them to notice the individual and subtle differences in the music. This response helps to provide context and understanding of why modern country music may seem repetitive and lacking in creativity.

On the other hand, reply B focuses more on the subjective nature of personal taste and preferences, suggesting that the original poster's dislike for modern country music is based on personal preference rather than any inherent flaw in the genre. While this is a valid point, it does not address the specific criticisms the original poster made about modern country music and does not provide as much insight into the genre itself.

predict-explain,"I have always hated pineapple pizza. I have tried it regularly for years to make sure I wasn't misunderstanding the appeal but it has never worked. Pineapple is a relatively sweet fruit on it's own and a combination of sweet and salty flavors is not that uncommon, however no amount of pepperoni or any other topping can mask the vile taste and dissappointment that is a mouthful of delicious pizza ruined by the fruit. This has led me to the conclusion that there is either something psychologically or potentially physiologically wrong with people who like pineapple pizza.

I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing him/her, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen. Plus, even if the suspect is really guilty, a police officer shouldn't kill him/ her, right? And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?

predict-explain,"**GONNA START OFF RIGHT NOW BY SAYING I DON'T LIVE BY THIS RULE.**

Reasons being:

1. I am 16 and (obviously) live with my family still, I don't have a job or any personal income to speak of. I don't have the financial independence to live by this creed.

2. It sounds like not much fun

One of those reasons is pretty valid and one definitely isn't.

I believe this because it just makes the most logical sense to me. Why on earth would it be fair for me to walk around with a new pair of shoes when there's people I can see *in my own damn neighborhood* who can't afford a square meal, to speak nothing of comfortable clothing? It's just...wrong.

That's why I think that as soon as somebody has their basic needs and some *reasonable, modest* comforts like a TV, and air conditioning, any more money past that should go to a charity, or similarly be used for good.

**I'm really, really not trying to be high and mighty about this**. I don't live like this, and honestly even when I move out and start making my own money I don't think I'd be able to bring myself to throw out the PC and the cellphone and the car. I also don't think there's any non-arbitrary specific point where it could be declared that someone is being selfish with their money, and also everybody's definition of ""basic needs and modest comforts"" is probably different. I think you still get my meaning.

I still believe, speaking in idealistic terms, it's unjustifiable to keep to yourself what would be best spent saving others.

**EDIT2:** A couple of challenges have been along the lines of, ""where do you draw the line on what's a basic need and what's frivolous spending?"" to which I'd have to respond, ""I don't know but I think you catch my drift"". Obviously if we were going to codify this belief into law there would need to be a strict number or strict criteria but on an individual basis, even though it'd be different from person to person, I think everybody knows roughly what's a reasonable need or desire and what's too much.

predict-explain,"I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that information triggers victims, and therefore the information ends up at ends. This includes language such as ""Pepper spray can deter attackers of any kind, and therefore it is strongly recommended that ANYBODY carries it with them at all times."" or ""Hot zones for crime include times after dusk and before dawn, so it is advised to travel in groups at this time to deter attackers.""

People rage at this information saying that I should not ask anything of the victim, and that this information is useless. People often use the argument ""We should teach people NOT TO RAPE""

My issue here is that the suppression of this information in lieu of pursuing an idealistic rape-free culture neglects the current standing of our surroundings, and that dangerous people still exist, and will exist for the foreseeable future. I see no harm in telling anyone that safety is important, and that there are very cogent steps to significantly lower your risk of being attacked and/or raped.

The only instance I would excuse my previous statement would be people telling actual victims of rape what they COULD have done. This does nothing to change what happened, and is a slimey thing to do.

Maybe this is just an Anti-SJW rant that I didn't even know I was making, or maybe I have an actual argument here. If I am not clear on this classic argument, I would appreciate some clarity, and am always open to thoughtful and courteous discussion.

The vast majority of rapes occur in the home of the victim or the rapist, and the rapist is someone that the victim knows and trusts. Here's the sad truth - if you are a woman, statistically, you are more likely to be raped by your dad than a stranger in the bushes. 

If you really want to prevent rape, you need to focus on the vast majority of rapes. So that to me would mean things like bystander intervention, where you emphasize the need for bystanders to step in and seperate someone from a situation they think could be inappropriate, teaching about rape and sexual violence during sex Ed so people grow up understanding what the signs of an abusive relationship looks like and how to get out. Also so that people learn that sexual violence is not the victims fault and what steps to take if they want to report to the police. So many people are afriad to come forward and the recidivism rate for sex crimes is so high it's this horrible cycle of serial rapists who don't ever get punished and people keep getting victimized. Also there needs to be more education on consent, not only to teach what consent is, but to help empower young girl to feel comfortable saying no and that they don't have to do anything sexually that they don't want to. A lot of us get the message that we should just go along with whatever the guy wants even if we don't want that, which opens us up to predators who take advantage of that situation.

You would find it absurd. You would say it's absolutely stupid to adapt to a Dystopian society instead of trying to improve this society.

Many people have this misconception that rapes only happen to attractive and sexy dressed women in dark alleys. This is a cliche conveyed by Hollywood.

Rape doesn't necessarily comes from strangers, and it also doesn't only happen to women who dress up sexy. Many rapists do it more because of  domination/power/humiliation reasons than because the victim is visually attractive to them.

This means that when you start of the path of victim blaming, there is simply no limit because there is no point where women will be safe. It starts with asking people to dress differently and hang out in safe places, and it ends up with asking women to stay at home and cover themselves entirely.

Second thing is: women are *already* taking precautions, and they do NOT need a guide to know what to do. What they don't want is for the medias to present the rape situation as something women are partly responsible of. 

There are already too many people who still don't admit that rape is rape in some situations... and you want to perpetuate the idea that this is true? Your solution wouldn't make things better (as I said, women already know what to do), it would only make things worse.",A,A,"Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides statistics and personal experience to support the argument that the majority of rapes occur in familiar settings and are perpetrated by someone known to the victim. This challenges the idea that safety precautions like carrying pepper spray or avoiding certain times of day can effectively prevent rape. Instead, Reply A suggests focusing on education, bystander intervention, and empowering individuals to recognize and report abusive behavior. 

On the other hand, Reply B focuses on the idea of victim blaming and argues that promoting safety precautions perpetuates the idea that women are responsible for preventing their own assaults. While this is an important point to consider, Reply B does not provide as much evidence or practical solutions as Reply A does. Additionally, the comparison to false rape accusations may not be as relevant to the original post's argument about promoting safety measures. 

Overall, Reply A presents a more compelling and informative argument that is more likely to challenge the original poster's perspective on addressing rape prevention."

The implications of AI depend strongly on the abilities of that AI, which could be roughly classified like this:

1. Narrow AI. Can do specific tasks that are not purely automated, but still relatively low-level. 
2. Analytical AI. Can effectively analyze (in a high-level way) problems with objective solutions. For example, this AI could determine the best treatment for a patient given information on research and the patient's symptoms and test results.

3. Innovative AI. Can come up with truly new ideas and create truly novel things on its own.   For example, this AI could come up with the idea for a new product and design it.
4. Total AI. Can do literally everything the human mind can do, including things like creating art.

AI of types 1 and 2 essentially increase productivity, but humans remain generally necessary to design new things.  Although it will displace many types of jobs, society with type 2 AI will still have a very broad need for humans to work. 

Type 3 AI will start closing the loop and therefore cutting humans out of the loop in a more complete way. At that point, the need for humans will be limited to things like the arts.  

The question, then, is how far are we away from type 3 AI?  We are increasingly developing type 2 AI, but we are conceptually very far away from type 3 AI.

Point A) *within the next few decades, AI will replace a sizable portion of our jobs.*

Yes. This much is clear, and it's hilarious because, as genetic modification makes our food more vulnerable to disease, by creating specialization in our economy we have set ourselves up for this. No arguments there.

Point B) *Within a few centuries, they'll replace almost all of them.*

Here I disagree. We're going to go through a real rough patch, perhaps even causing a weird Great Depression style collapse, but 200 years ago, 90 percent of Americans were agriculturalists. Today, that number is two percent. We evolved, and if you remember the dust bowl struggles when industrial farming came about, you'll remember that was a struggle too.

We'll remodel our society, as we have for the past forever, to fit needs that, in theory, robots cannot fill, including:

1. **Space exploration and colonization.** Yes, robots have been and are doing an amazing job exploring space for us already, but the value of having a human on another planet, or out in space exploring, is uncountable. AI would help us be able to focus more on the expansion of our species into space.

2. **Entertainment** My biggest disagreement with the CGP video is how he frames the idea of entertainers being replaced by AI. Sure, they can write beautiful music, but how much is recorded music going for right now, anyway? And people enjoy watching PEOPLE perform. There's nothing particularly beautiful about an arabesque, but what's beautiful is watching a person do it. Same with acting, singing, sports, etc.

3. **Engineering**: This one seems pretty simple. It'll be a long time (in theory) before we can automate robots that can out engineer us. 

4. **Cyber Protection** This is the biggest one. If all of our medical information is on a universal collection of robot interfaces, we will need basically an endless army of humans to help defend this from hackers. The more AI we have, the more we need to protect it. People who would be able to take control of that AI would control the world.

There's a lot more, and it's going to be a hard road, but at the end of it, our society will evolve so that our jobs will be more fulfilling and human-necessary. Just as you don't weep for the Iceman, the Lamplighter, and the Switchboard Operator, know that no one will be weeping for the barista, the paralegal, or taxi driver.",B,A,"I would say reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a more detailed breakdown of the different types of AI and their implications on the job market. It also highlights that we are still far away from AI that can completely replace humans in all aspects. This nuanced explanation may help the original poster see that the situation may not be as dire as initially thought. Reply B, on the other hand, focuses more on the potential for society to evolve and create new jobs that AI cannot fulfill, which may not address the original poster's concerns about widespread job loss due to automation."
predict-explain,"It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified:

* The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for, either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild. If we're using the usual justification of animal rights - they can feel pain/have a life - then letting them lead a safe and happy life in captivity seems to be more moral than the dangers of the wild.

* This is a less quantifiable good, but zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies.

While I guess the best way to C my V would be to provide overwhelming evidence that zoos provide lower quality of life for the animals than life in the wild and that there are more effective means of conserving/promoting endanger species, I'm mostly interested in values/premises I haven't considered. 

Change my view! :)

Just think of it as though aliens kept you captive in their zoo. Are there any conditions that would justify that? Not really. But on the other side of the spectrum, it doesn't matter what you do with a fly. 

I know I could debate until the end of time with some people about which animals do and don't apply for person rights, and you could argue that since humans are not on the same page about that, then zoos are unethical, but the reality is that we can know which animals are at risk of deserving person rights, and which are not, and there are far fewer animals that do, than don't. 

So, zoos could still work. But no orcas, no dolphins, no otters, no cephalopods, no ravens, no parrots, no elephants, no monkeys or apes. And probably others I am not thinking of, or don't know about.","While the benefits you mention are certainly a good thing to take into consideration when talking about the ethics of zoos, I feel that as long as a zoo is in possession of an animal that has demonstrated a degree of intelligence on par with toddlers, as many different species have, the benefits will be far outweighed by the downsides. Locking up a human toddler in a way too small cage just for education is an obvious no-go, so animals such as parrots, elephants, dolphins and chimpanzees which have all demonstrated high degrees of intelligence and emotions should never be kept in a cage. As long as they are, a zoo can *not* be considered ethical. Many of these animals are demonstrably miserable in captivity and will lead lives far inferior to the lives they would lead in either the wild or in wild-like conditions. As long as we can not provide these conditions to them we should never lock them up.

Not to mention zoos break up family groups of animals which have demonstrated strong social bonds such as orcas and elephants, to sell the babies to other zoos. This is scarring the animals emotionally to the point where the animals will grief for long periods of time. This is not only heartbreaking but also unethical.",B,A,"I would say that reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because reply B brings up the important point of considering the intelligence and emotional capacity of the animals being held in captivity. By comparing it to locking up a human toddler for education, reply B highlights the moral implications of keeping highly intelligent and emotional animals in captivity. Additionally, the mention of breaking up family groups and the emotional impact on the animals further emphasizes the ethical concerns of zoos. Overall, reply B provides a strong argument against the ethical justification of zoos, particularly when it comes to certain species that have demonstrated high levels of intelligence and emotions."
predict-explain,"I think that rather than assuming the uniformity of nature, scientists take it as a tentative hypothesis. My main reason for having this view is due to how I think scientists would respond if something did happen that disproved the uniformity of nature. I believe if something suddenly changed, scientists would acknowledge this change and attempt further investigation into why this change was possible. I do not believe that scientists would simply outright deny that a change has happened, which is what I think they would do if they simply assumed the uniformity of nature.

For example, take gravity. We can observe the effects of gravity on earth, and the effects of gravity in our solar system near Mercury. If we say that the laws should be the same everywhere, then we notice what we observe on earth is not true for Mercury. If scientists assume that gravity should work the same everywhere, then either our observations of Mercury are wrong or our understanding of gravity through Newton is wrong. Because of further exploration into gravity, Einstein resolved these issues with relativity and showed our observations of Mercury were correct, while our theory of gravity was incomplete. 

However, if scientists assume that maybe the laws of the universe don't work the same everywhere, then there's no reason to search for a new theory. Saying, ""that's just how it works over there"" is not science, it's a cop out. It's giving up and not searching for some unifying or universal theory that connects all observations. 

Hence the search for the theory of everything, or some theory that unifies quantum mechanics and relativity. The search is on the basis that there should be uniformity in the universe, the laws that govern the small should be the same that govern the large. If scientists don't assume uniformity, then the search is baseless.","Scientists, as far as I know, have to assume uniformity or all the scientific theories fail. The thing is though, none have failed for that reason, so they really have evidence by now.

The example of gravity and the comparison between Newtonian physics and Einstein's theory of relativity effectively demonstrates how assuming uniformity can lead to advancements in scientific understanding. Reply A also emphasizes the importance of searching for a unifying theory that connects all observations, which further strengthens the argument for assuming uniformity in nature.

On the other hand, Reply B also acknowledges the importance of being open to changing views based on new evidence, but it lacks the depth and specificity of the argument presented in Reply A. Reply B simply states that scientists have evidence to support the assumption of uniformity without providing any examples or explanations to back up this claim.

predict-explain,"The full quote from Steven Weinberg can be found [here](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg).

&gt;Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.

I've seen people use this quote many times. To me, it's inflammatory anti-religious nonsense. I'm interested to see the other perspective. Have I misunderstood his quote? Is there something about human nature that I've misunderstood?

First of all, I recognize that religion can cause good people to do bad things. It has done it many times and it will continue to do so. ISIS is the most obvious example right now, but there are countless other examples as well.

What I can't understand is the last sentence:

&gt;But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.

He seems to be saying that **only religion** can cause good people to do bad things. This seems like total nonsense to me. TONS of things can cause good people to do bad things.

For example, soldiers who commit war crimes sometimes do so because they were ""just following orders,"" out of a sense of patriotism, or in order to protect their families.

Poverty can make good people do evil things. 

Drugs can, too. They can temporarily taking away people's sanity, which causes them to do stupid things. Or drug addictions can drive people to such financial desperation that they're willing to do evil things to get their next hit.

---

Let me explain what I understand by ""good people"" and ""evil things."" Perhaps I haven't properly understood what Weinberg meant by these words?

A ""good person"" is someone who wouldn't normally do an evil thing without the influence of some outside force. In the case of this quote, the ""outside force"" is religion.

An ""evil thing"" is anything that society generally sees as extremely bad, such as murder. 

In order to CMV, please:

* convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things.
* show me that I could've misunderstood Weinberg.
* show me that my definitions of ""good person"" or ""evil thing"" are wrong (in the context of Weinberg's quote, of course).
* anything else that shows that anything I've said is wrong.

Edit: Cleaned the post up a little bit.","This is my first time encountering this quote, but tis is my interpretation:
This quote could be held as true only under the premise that ""religion"" in this case does not refer exclusively to theistic religions. Any system of rituals or beliefs that people follow, including the patriotic following of orders you referred to, is a religion in this context.

As for your other examples, they might be countered in a small variety of ways, depending on the interpreter's beliefs, including something like the following:
-Actions taken by a person in poverty in order to survive are not evil because the person has no alternative
-People who are drugged are not themselves, in that they are controlled by the effects of the substance or addiction thereto.","&gt;convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things.

That depends. When do you define a person by their actions whether they're good and when do you define them by their ideology?

Indoctrination happens in mostly religious households and scenarios. Yes, political as well, but when it comes to beliefs and values I think religion does the indoctrination part a bit more. Especially with the whole ""hell if you don't believe"" idea.

I think that someone isn't a good person if they have an ideology I disagree with. I think nationalists are bad, fascists are bad and so on. So when it comes to ideology, they're not good people doing bad things, they're bad people doing bad things.

&gt;show me that I could've misunderstood Weinberg.

I mean it's all about interpretation.

""Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.""

He's certainly right when saying with or without religion, good people would do good things and bad people would do evil things.

Some actions aren't evil, yet aren't good either. So maybe good people could do bad things yet not evil.

Theft is an obvious example. It's not a good thing surely, and good people could do this whether or not they were religious, for different reasons. But it's hardly *evil*. Sometimes, theft is necessary or them to survive.

Can't really think of anything else to add here.

&gt;show me that my definitions of ""good person"" or ""evil thing"" are wrong (in the context of Weinberg's quote, of course).

I suppose I already said what I thought on here.

&gt;anything else that shows that anything I've said is wrong.

I agree that drugs is a problem. But then you could have the philosophical discussion like... Are they really themselves when influenced by drugs?

Religious people aren't drunk or intoxicated when doing things, they're fully aware.",A,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B provides a more nuanced perspective on the quote, highlighting the role of ideology in causing good people to do bad things, not just religion. The user also challenges the original poster's definitions of ""good person"" and ""evil thing"" within the context of Weinberg's quote, offering a different interpretation that could prompt the original poster to reconsider their understanding.

Google had a project where they created a self driving car, they were pretty successful.  I think it's great new technology, but I don't see it transferring it over to average consumers.

If you disagree with me up until this point, here's my biggest concession.  The trend of car ownership will decrease at a faster rate than self-driving cars will increase.

predict-explain,"**Partial Delta for /u/DHCKris.**

*I'll give you a partial ∆ because I do think that New Friends works as a combination option, but I think my CMV is more focused on the idea of someone who's either exclusively listed as For Friends, or their profile makes it out that they are primarily (nearly exclusively) for friends. I think in terms of actually being useful to users, it would be nice to have some kind of flagging system for this. My main gripe is that all these sites just show you faces and user names, and you don't really know that these people aren't interested until you've already been drawn in.*
___
*This is based on my experience over about 4-6 months of casually using Tinder and OkC, if that helps you form any counter arguments or gives any perspective. Also, this isnt about poly relationships looking for another partner, the scope of my view doesn't even approach that.*

Something I've noticed with slightly surprising frequency on dating sites are profiles that have one of the following kinds of statements- ""Looking for friends, no commitments."", ""My husband/boyfriend knows I have this to make friends, and I'm not going to cheat so don't bother"", ""I just moved here and thought this would be a good way to make some friends"", ""I don't take this seriously, I'm just here for the laughs, really not looking for a relationship"" ... etc...

Personally, I feel these kinds of profiles don't belong on dating sites, and only serve to come off as disingenuous or disappointing. Most dating sites just give you a series of profile pictures and names, and you choose which ones you find attractive to open up and read. The image draws you in, and then the ""Just for friends"" lets you down. To me, this is like someone attending a speed dating night at a singles bar, someone finds them very attractive and wants to see about striking up a relationship, and then they say ""Oh I only came here to maybe find some friends and enjoy people trying too hard"". If you're really looking for friends, there are places designed for platonic relationships- in the context of online communities there's places like subreddits for local towns, there's meetup.com, there's plenty of public Facebook groups for all kinds of interests, etc... 

Going to a place specifically marketed to and called a dating app is just disingenuous. I wouldn't go to Ashley Madison if I just wanted to get a platonic shoe shopping buddy.

I agree with you that when someone is ONLY looking for friends, it feels disappointing. I mean, why are you here, then? But, OKC lets you select ""new friends"" **as well as** ""long-term/short-term relationship/casual sex/etc."" I've been on dates with girls who have told me that they like meeting new people and aren't adverse to remaining friends with a date that doesn't mesh romantically or sexually with them. I think the absence of a ""new friends"" preference is meant to be telling: they absolutely do not want to interact with you unless sex or a relationship is on the table.

In other words, when combined with other options, it says something about the openess of the person to different kinds of relationships. That says something about a person, to me. It is only when their preference is *exclusively* ""new friends"" that it is annoying. But I would be more inclined to date someone who had ""new friends"" in addition to other things because I feel like it makes them seem less desperate (but that's just me).","What about people who value friendship more highly than other aspects of a relationship, and want to start on that basis? What if they're looking for someone who wants to be friends first, and in a committed relationship second, and they expect that if they find the right person, it'll evolve into a committed relationship.

You can say, and I may agree, that this is the wrong way to go about looking for love, but why would it be fair to exclude people from the dating site just because they have a different way of going about things?

Reply B brings up a valid point about people valuing friendship more highly and wanting to start on that basis. It challenges the original poster's assumption that dating sites should only be for those looking for committed relationships. By highlighting that some people may want to build a friendship first before moving into a committed relationship, it opens up the idea that there are different ways to approach dating and relationships. 

Additionally, reply B also presents a counterargument by comparing it to the exclusion of people looking for casual sex on dating sites. This comparison helps to show that there are different preferences and intentions when it comes to using dating sites, and it may not be fair to exclude those who are looking for friendships first.

predict-explain,"I've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my friends or the people who have gone through that with family or people in general.


As I was walking with my date (M) through town, a group of college students started laughing at us for holding hands. As we were walking by, I kept thinking of all the ways I could get them to stop because if they were to laugh at us, who else are they gonna make feel humiliated or disgusting. I felt like a pet. Some play toy. And that my life was humorous to other people.


I can't say that there would be anything to say or do to make them realize that it's normal to appeal to the same sex. I'm ALL FOR education. I believe education makes the world go around and it's so perfect to learn abd understand new things about the world AND be open minded to everything. 


However, when I see a group of people act ignorantly, I can't help but clench my fist and think about raising hell in their life. The people they are are the kind that take pleasure in hurting people. Why? Because they want to do it for themselves. They can only think about themselves and that they're more perfect than everyone else.


I sure as hell am not perfect. I resort to violence when it comes down to this topic. But when I hear or see ignorance made to hurt others, like this (https://youtu.be/1df_i26wh-w). I can't help but feel like this ignorance needs to be dealt with a punch in the face. Nobody deserves what I got. And nobody deserves the ignorance others recieve.


Ignorance stems from close mindedness, which is something in this world we don't need. If we were all close minded, we wouldn't have advanced as far as we have. Do we really need more of it in this world? Is it necessary for our survival? I believe so to the extent that when there is an absolutely close minded person,there is an equally absolutely open minded person (the bell curve).


So to deal with these people is to punish them with hurt nowhere near the pain they've inflicted onto people, while still sending a message. CMV


Edit: I know violence won't get me anywhere. Are there any other solutions besides time, education and ignorng other people that can remedy the situation more directly?","First of all, let me just say that I understand how you feel. I've been in the same situation as you but not for the same reason. 

I'm from the US and during my middle school through early high school years, I went to school abroad in a non-english-speaking country. Ignorant remarks about my mastery of the english language were commonplace, with my peers often telling me to not speak English because I wasn't in the US, speak clearer, speak slower, and to go back to the US if I was going to speak English. Sometimes they would be joking, other times I feel not so much. 

Violence would not have solved anything. It's not like once I would've hit them they would have gone ""Wow, I guess this guy's right. He's changed my view entirely with a punch to my face"". No. They would have resented me, associated violence with being able to speak English correctly, and strengthened their opinion as true. 

The fact is, ignorant people react this way to things that seem foreign to them because that's what they've been taught. Their negligent parents never taught them to be tolerant or that people can be with whomever they want. Or those types of reactions are applauded by their ignorant circle of friends. Or, in your case, they grasp at the opportunity to make sure their friends don't think they're gay too (though most of the time the people that make the most commotion out of it are usually the ones that are hiding something). 

Ultimately, violence does not deter this kind of behavior. In the short run, yes: you can raise hell and they'll go away. But the next day they'll find someone that can't defend his or herself physically against these bullies and the ignorance continues. 

The only thing in the world that solves ignorance is education. Not violence. And we're getting there. 

Think of it this way: homosexuality has been seen as bad for hundreds (if not thousands) of years, and the western world has undergone the transition from ""gays = weird, disease-ridden, etc."" (ignorant, inaccurate descriptions) to just having legalized gay marriage a couple of weeks ago in the US. 

As with most issues of ignorance in society, it takes a while to eradicate it. Blacks and Whites getting along as they do now (for the most part) was inconceivable to Americans of just 100 years ago. Look how far we are now. 

The good news is that we're getting there.","Violence takes many forms.  It can be physical (punching someone) or it can be more abstract like censorship (imposing will).  Violence is the use of force.  

Endorsing violence to change close minded people is pretty circular.  One who uses violence as a tool to impose will is being just as close minded.  What you're really saying is ""they will never agree with my correct view, therefore I need to force them to change for the betterment of all."" There's a utility to that but I personally believe it's dangerous.

Advocating discourse and advocating for violence are polar opposites.  It's ironic that someone from the LGBT community would advocate for the latter over the former, considering the fact that if you went back 100 years, it was majority heterosexuals seeking to impose their will via violence to curb homosexuality.  Now, we find that sort of behavior atrocious.  

Discourse however allows for the free flow of thoughts and ideas to change the minds and hearts of others.  It's the whole purpose of this sub and its power speaks for itself.  

I think you're being absolute in saying the close minded people can never change.  

And only a Sith deals in absolutes....",A,A,"I would say that reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B does a good job of pointing out the dangers and limitations of using violence to try to change close-minded people. It highlights the irony of advocating for violence as a solution, especially coming from a member of the LGBT community who has likely experienced oppression and violence themselves. The comparison to historical attempts to oppress homosexuality through violence is a powerful argument against using violence to combat ignorance.

Additionally, reply B emphasizes the power of discourse and the free flow of ideas in changing minds and hearts. It encourages the original poster to consider the potential for growth and change in close-minded individuals, rather than resorting to violence as a solution. 

Overall, reply B provides a more nuanced and thoughtful perspective on the issue, making it more likely to change the original poster's view."

There is ""intrinsic"" meaning to life. Your experience and internal meta-narrative are what will determine what kind of conclusions you come to about life. If you do meditate, you can often get a clearer idea of this. Some ideas are ""sticky"" while others are not. Try not to prefer one over the other, and you'll find the need for ""meaning"" to fade away. 

I don't know whether I was helpful. You said you were a skeptical person, so I answered in a way a skeptic would appreciate. Good luck!

Getting out of bed is basically a pre-requisite for making delicious scrambled eggs.","I'm a deist and also don't believe in free will, but I don't consider life not worth living. Life may seem POINTLESS, that's fair, we don't know the deeper meaning or if there is one. But worth means that the pleasure you can get is worth the shit you have to go through. If you're depressed, you might say life's not worth living. If you're happy and doing fun stuff and basically living a hedonist lifestyle, you can enjoy it. I believe you're making the point that life seems ""pointless"" rather than ""worthless."" 

I think you're basically saying that since we all die eventually, and if there's no afterlife then it seems pointless to live in the first place. It's like drinking and having a great night partying but you don't remember in the morning: what's the point?

This is also relevant... As I said I don't believe in free will but I do believe that the purpose of the universe is for life. It's an expanded-on deistic perspective. So I also encountered this paradox dealing with free will; if free will doesn't exist, and every thought and action we have is scientifically predetermined, then isn't that a paradox? I recently discovered this one spiritualist viewpoint that actually solves this paradox, and it is the most logical religious/spiritualist philosophy I've ever come across. I'm still skeptical, but I think you should read this pdf link I'll give you, it's better then ""Man's search for Meaning"" lol.

Evolution by natural selection is a scientific theory on which individuals of a species continue on to reproduce. Darwin did not intend for evolution to be used as a way to govern a society. Survival of the fittest isn't even his idea, it was a fanboy named Herbert Spencer who sought to find a way to explain the theory to simpletons.

predict-explain,"I think it is the opinion of many people on the internet, and of reddit in particular that the companies trying to fight piracy should ""Deal with it"" -- that they need to realize that the internet is the future and trying to fight piracy is impossible (or prohibitively expensive) in a free web. 

A little bit about myself, and my habits -- I am 20 years old, a liberal raised on the internet and currently in school studying film. I have torrented rarely for probably 5 years, but I would consider myself on the bottom end of piracy. I subscribe to Netflix, Amazon prime and Spotify, and usually buy my games on steam. Because of these services I never pirate music or games ever, and I usually do not pirate Television or Movies either.

As an aspiring filmmaker myself, it feels hypocritical to steal someone else's hard work, and so if at all possible I do not do that. I am more than willing to pay 3-5 dollars to rent a movie I want to watch. But this is not the internet we live in. While some movies are available on youtube, itunes and amazon instant for rental, many are either only available to buy or not available at all. On top of that, these services tend to have a charge to rent the ""HD"" version of the film, a practice I believe to be archaic and stupid in an age where everyone has HD monitors and/or TVs. 

In my mind, if there were a service that made a huge selection of films available for a one-time viewing for $5 easily and at full quality -- with options for downloading if need be -- I personally would never pirate films or TV. 

However, this may not represent the consumer base as a whole and may not be enough to save the companies afraid of the internet. 

(WARNING: I AM GOING OFF WHAT I HAVE READ IN THIS SECTION -- I DO NOT HAVE SOURCES FOR MY CLAIMS YET) 

While Spotify does seem mitigate piracy, it also does not give much money to artists as a rule. But, at the same time, most artists make their money from touring and not from album sales, as the record label would end up taking most of the money from itunes/CD sales anyways. So part of me thinks that in this open age that perhaps it is the companies that should fail, if they cannot accept the internet's existence, freeing the artists to receive more money for sales directly from services such as Spotify and iTunes. The same applies to movies, television (which Netflix has helped a lot, I think) and games (I don't know many people who pirate games, since they are readily available on Steam and GOG.com as a rule) as well.

TL;DR -- I think the companies fighting piracy should give up and try to mitigate it instead -- adapt rather than fight. 

What do you think? Change my view!

It's a business decision to extract the most money out of a piece of media by subjecting it to windowing.   That is first get the money out of the people who will pay 11 dollars to watch it one time.  Then get the 20 dollars out of the people who will buy the blu-ray.

predict-explain,"EDIT: Running off to lecture but I'll be back to check responses in a couple of hours. To copy and paste an abbreviated version my reasoning here: 

&gt;I think one of the larger roadblocks I'm running into in is distinguishing between identity, behavior, and biology. Because of how closely linked they are I was willing to concede non-heterosexuality encompassing orientations pretty much from the beginning. However I'm also stubbornly holding on to the idea that historically, heterosexual behaviors have been encouraged and any orientation that would facilitate them would be selected for. From there, I concluded that heterosexuality and bisexuality would be the two most likely sexualities to be propagated (by some abstracted gene selection process) but didn't understand why the more restrictive option would be selected for over the less restrictive one.

The answer seems to be hiding in probabilities so if anyone can expand on that more I'm willing to give deltas. 

Also, if you have a problem with my reasoning, please leave an explanation with your downvote so I can understand why it's off. 

---

I struggle to believe that most human beings are naturally supposed to only be attracted to the opposite sex and are inherently repulsed by same sex characteristics. I think most people identify as straight out of convenience and having never needed to question what was assumed for them. I’m not denying that heterosexuality is a legitimate orientation but I have not found convincing evidence against, for example, the possibility that most humans could be predisposed to bisexuality and simply develop a preference of one or none from there. 

The only arguments I’ve read for heterosexuality being default is the biological urge to have children, which I believe is neither universal nor exclusive to heterosexuality and the (imo fallacious) “most people are straight so there ***must*** be a biological mechanism that supports this phenomenon” path of reasoning. 

I'm willing to give a delta to any argument that can demonstrate why heterosexuality might be more advantageous  or likely than bisexuality.

What you are asking it seems is if there's a genetic determination for heterosexuality. 

One way to answer this question is to look at twins, because they have the same genome, but can have different environment if they are raised separately, they allow to distinguish between genetic and environmental effects with a bit of math. It seems people found a bit of genetic determination for sexual preference.

Another way it just to sequence the genome of a large number of people, and to ask them their sexual preference. If you have enough of these, and with a bit a of math, you can measure how much genetic factors determine a trait. It seems people have found genetic determinants of sexual preference, although the studies are still quite preliminary.

You can also look across different species, for example the genetic of sexual behavior of fruit flies is well understood. There's also some genes in mice that seems to control sexual preference.

Finally one can look across societies, both contemporary and in the past. If something, like sexual preference is conserved across all societies, it's a argument for a genetic basis of sexual preference, because it rules out other environmental factors. I'm not sure about the answer here, but it seems to me that most societies are mainly heterosexual.

Note that everything that touch reproduction is usually under strong selective pressure, because it affects fitness much more directly than other traits.

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation","People keep responding with ""heterosexuality lets you pass on your genes, so it's better.""  This is in great contrast to the more fundamental principle of the selfish gene as outlined by Richard Dawkins.  You are not what natural selection cares about: only genes are.  If a gene is reproduced, it is successful, regardless of whether or not individual carriers of the gene reproduce.

This explains why homosexuality is prevalent in animals.  Sure, a homosexual organism may not *personally* reproduce, but genes which contribute to that behavior may be distributed in a great many other organisms.  Most likely, those closely related to the homosexual one.  This means that a combination of genes which produce homosexual organisms with a reasonable frequency give us a collection of related organisms, in which some do not personally reproduce.  This is theorized to result in additional caretakers, improving the survivability of that *cluster* of organisms which mostly carry the genes responsible.

So natural selection can absolutely favor ""gay genes""--you just won't find a stable population in which *all* organisms are gay (for obvious reasons).  But it seems that, for many social species, having these genes in the pool is better than not having them.  I.e., they are not actually selected against.

But you may have noticed a key point here.  Although genes which contribute to homosexuality (in combination, or with certain environmental factors, etc.) may be well distributed throughout the population, the system appears to work best when the number of dedicated homosexual organisms is a minor fraction.  To phrase it in inexact terms, about ""one per family"".

As a result, the most stable and successful population has homosexuality in the minority.  It is very important to understand that this does not make it bad, and in fact this appears to be better for survival of the collective gene pool than having no homosexuality.  So it's not weird, it's not ""selected against"", it's not an aberration, but it *is* a minority expression.  That's its optimum distribution.

I would shy away from using the word ""normal"", which has a lot of connotative baggage, and go with the word ""typical"".  Heterosexuality in humans is typical, homosexuality considerably less so, and both contribute to our collective survival.  As we run up to a lot of population walls, and the population plateaus, the equation will change.  At that point (and perhaps we're already getting there), the optimum distribution of homosexuality may be higher.

Aside from all that, there's the matter of bisexuality.  Genetics and behavior are very complex, but when you consider the idea that there are various contributing genes which affect us in different circumstances to, in general, provide a baseline level of homosexuality in the population, it's understandable that many other people may *partially* express that orientation.  Certain aspects of homosexuality can coexist with heterosexual behavior, and so we have bisexuality.  Nevertheless, it seems that statistically the heterosexual behavior must be more common in the population for optimum performance.  So despite bisexual tendencies, heterosexuality is still typical, and more often expressed in individuals with some bisexual behavior than homosexuality is.

You could argue that someone who's even a *little* bit bisexual no longer counts as ""straight"", but if pretty much their entire history of relationships and actual sexual activity is straight, and they just happen to enjoy gay porn sometimes, I think it's reasonable to call them functionally straight.  If we divide bisexuality into ""mostly straight"" and ""mostly gay"", you'll see that straight+mostly straight is much more common than gay+mostly gay.

And beyond all that, you propose that ""most humans could be predisposed to bisexuality and simply develop a preference of one or none from there.""  Well, sure, but you have to realize that we're dealing with a gradient and not three distinct buckets.  We don't start in one bucket and then choose another later.  We have a complex and sprawling map of behaviors.  Our genetics contribute to which paths we take.  It appears that the most typical situation is that people stick to heterosexuality in most circumstances, even if certain circumstances would result in homo/bisexual behavior.  So straight is still typical, despite our potential gradient of behavior.",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B provides a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of the genetic and evolutionary factors that may influence sexual orientation. It also addresses the potential for bisexuality and the complexity of human behavior in a nuanced way.

predict-explain,"I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that information triggers victims, and therefore the information ends up at ends. This includes language such as ""Pepper spray can deter attackers of any kind, and therefore it is strongly recommended that ANYBODY carries it with them at all times."" or ""Hot zones for crime include times after dusk and before dawn, so it is advised to travel in groups at this time to deter attackers.""

People rage at this information saying that I should not ask anything of the victim, and that this information is useless. People often use the argument ""We should teach people NOT TO RAPE""

My issue here is that the suppression of this information in lieu of pursuing an idealistic rape-free culture neglects the current standing of our surroundings, and that dangerous people still exist, and will exist for the foreseeable future. I see no harm in telling anyone that safety is important, and that there are very cogent steps to significantly lower your risk of being attacked and/or raped.

The only instance I would excuse my previous statement would be people telling actual victims of rape what they COULD have done. This does nothing to change what happened, and is a slimey thing to do.

Maybe this is just an Anti-SJW rant that I didn't even know I was making, or maybe I have an actual argument here. If I am not clear on this classic argument, I would appreciate some clarity, and am always open to thoughtful and courteous discussion.

Please no flaming, arguing, or fighting. Thank you!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","I'm going to reverse the genders. 

How would you feel if you were told [this is how men should act to avoid false-rape accusations](https://i.imgur.com/7LXtLB5.jpg) ?

You would find it absurd. You would say it's absolutely stupid to adapt to a Dystopian society instead of trying to improve this society.

Many people have this misconception that rapes only happen to attractive and sexy dressed women in dark alleys. This is a cliche conveyed by Hollywood.

Rape doesn't necessarily comes from strangers, and it also doesn't only happen to women who dress up sexy. Many rapists do it more because of  domination/power/humiliation reasons than because the victim is visually attractive to them.

This means that when you start of the path of victim blaming, there is simply no limit because there is no point where women will be safe. It starts with asking people to dress differently and hang out in safe places, and it ends up with asking women to stay at home and cover themselves entirely.

Second thing is: women are *already* taking precautions, and they do NOT need a guide to know what to do. What they don't want is for the medias to present the rape situation as something women are partly responsible of. 

There are already too many people who still don't admit that rape is rape in some situations... and you want to perpetuate the idea that this is true? Your solution wouldn't make things better (as I said, women already know what to do), it would only make things worse.","Overall I agree with your point. I think it is largely detrimental to overall safety.

But as a counter argument:

Let's assume you can either argue for a person carrying pepper spray or against. Let's disregard the rationale for why you would argue for either for the moment.

Now consider a scenario where a person is faced with a choice between walking home at night through a not so nice neighborhood or taking a cab home. If the person feels safe enough, they will walk to avoid paying the cab, else they will pay and take the cab.

If the person is carrying pepper spray, they will feel safer. Let's assume that they feel safe enough to walk home if they are carrying pepper spray, but not safe enough to walk home if they are not carrying pepper spray.

So now we have three scenarios. Ranked from most risky to least risky they are: Walk home without pepper spray, walk home with pepper spray, and cab home.

If you do not have pepper spray, then you cannot walk home with pepper spray (obviously) and vice versa. So depending on your initial choice of advocating or not advocating for pepper spray, your options are limited from three to two scenarios.

From here I feel like you get where I'm going with it and to not belabor the point anymore: If you advocate for no pepper spray then a person who accepts you advice is more likely to take a cab, which is safer than walking with pepper spray.

Therefore, if we put aside reasons for arguing for or against victim protection, it is possible that arguing against victims protecting themselves produces a safer outcome.",B,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a strong argument against victim blaming and advocating for self-protection measures. It highlights the danger of victim blaming and the misconception that only certain types of women are at risk of rape. It also addresses the issue of power dynamics and how rape is often about domination rather than attraction. Additionally, Reply A points out that women are already taking precautions and do not need to be told what to do, and that perpetuating the idea that women are partly responsible for rape is harmful.

On the other hand, Reply B presents a scenario where advocating against self-protection measures could potentially lead to a safer outcome. While it provides a logical argument, it does not address the underlying issue of victim blaming and the importance of empowering individuals to protect themselves.

Overall, Reply A provides a more comprehensive and persuasive argument that is likely to challenge the original poster's views on victim protection and rape prevention."
predict-explain,"This may be surprising to some if you look at my history on this sub, where I posted several CMVs critical of Gamergate, the police and conservatives, but here goes... we've gone way overboard with this PC/Social Justice mentality.

Recent examples are-

-the furor this morning (at least on twitter) over Amy Schumer in the WaPo. http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/06/dont-believe-her-defenders-amy-schumers-jokes-are-racist/

-Hannibal Burress had a minor run-in with several notable female twitter personalities including Gaby Dunn. https://twitter.com/hannibalburess/status/618179591140564992 (there's a whole list of responses, if it doesn't show up just go through his timeline)

-Jerry Seinfeld made news when he said he wouldn't play college campuses anymore, to much reminding of his relationship with a 17-year old twenty years ago, and snickering over how his material isn't even edgy anyway. http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/10/living/seinfeld-comedy-colleges-feat/

-Chris Rock said the same thing last year. I guess he's a shitlord too. http://www.vulture.com/2014/11/chris-rock-frank-rich-in-conversation.html

-Patton Oswalt, who at one point was booed in Philly for his anti-Bush beliefs back during 2004 or so, is now not worthy of being followed. He's in a category with Trump and Palin. http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/patton-oswalt-twitter-troll-unfollow/

-Not to pick on Gaby Dunn, but earlier this year she blew up at Josh Groban, because I guess young male celebrities being horndogs is completely new and has never, ever happened in human history. https://storify.com/amandataylor88/don-t-fall-for-this-famous-guy-s-flattery

Hell, even amongst the more notable far-left twitter there's infighting. Suey Park and Lauren Chief Elk are going at it over DMs to an ex/stolen laptops https://twitter.com/suey_park/status/617747933987889152

And depending on who you believe, Rania Khalek is anti-black http://bad-dominicana.tumblr.com/post/87992874258/rania-khalek-such-an-antiblack-piece-of-shit-like or ""bad_dominacana"" is racist against Arabs https://twitter.com/raniakhalek/status/514920026236018688.

I was, am and will be a dyed-in-the-patchouli liberal. I was ecstatic that gays can get married now. I will call Caitlyn Jenner whatever SHE wants me to. I'm a big fan of Bernie Sanders. I absolutely believe all fortysomething of Bill Cosby's accusers.
That said, I'm starting to feel a little lost. I cringe when I see the word ""thinkpiece."" I hate that people get so caught up in a perpetual outrage machine and so high off their own self-righteousness they will destroy a life like Justine Sacco's (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html?_r=0) for sport. (Also, how great is Sam Biddle for basically admitting he'd do it all over again for ""the clickz?"") I have to believe that the right or, ""The Man,"" are absolutely loving this infighting. Endless digital ink is spilled on Black Widow in The Avengers while cops are still shooting anyone with a skin tone darker than Burnt Sienna.

Am I wrong? Am I the asshole here? Is all of this of vital importance? Will the 24/7/365 internet analytical news cycle bring us to the promised land? Or is this just a tool of cultural commentators on a deadline?

EDIT:  I'll add this since I'm getting a lot of advice to get off twitter.  I definitely don't go on as much as I used to, but it's hard for me to stay off completely for two reasons.  One, there's a lot of actually good, funny twitterers out there.  It's also a good news source, it's how I found out we got Bin Laden.  Two, as someone who, despite all warning signs, wants to be involved someday in the comedy/entertainment biz, it's kinda necessary for those on the come up to use it as a promotional tool.  If I was Spielberg or Tarantino I'd get the hell off, trust me.  But I'm a nobody from nowhere at the moment.

Try not to focus on the Twitter thing as much.  There's pieces on Gawker, WaPo and Daily Dot that I've used for examples.  Here's a piece on the AVClub where the writer complains about female fans of Captain Marvel for... reasons.  Not sure.  They're problematic somehow.

http://www.avclub.com/article/marvel-learned-wrong-lessons-carol-corps-218003

EDIT 2:  Not sure how much longer this'll stay active, or how much I'll be able to check in tomorrow so I'll do a pseudo-wrap up here.  I used mainly examples from the comedy world and Twitter since that's what immediately came to mind.  Other examples I could've used were Donglegate (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/) and ScientistShirtgate (http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/11/18/scientist-shirt-feminism-comet-your-say/19248543/).  I think those two, and there are others, are also worthy of discussion in that they involve nuance.  Someone like Donald Trump, that's a black-and-white case of racism.  

Someone in the comments said this seemed like neurotic hand-wringing by an alienated individual, and that could very well be the case.  I didn't really spend a whole lot of time making a comprehensive essay about this because a-it's just reddit and b-I posted from the gut with immediacy.  If someone wants to take this theme and do it up better, by all means go for it.  I never claimed to be a social scientist.  Or even just social.

Some good opinions here, with the major consensus being that these things seem big and important on the internet where everything is a hot take and people are either Lawful Good or Chaotic Evil with no in-between.  So in stepping out from the cyberspace will keep the perspective in check.

Good talk everyone!  No name calling or trolling!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","I am as Socialist as the 14 work-day is long. The type of Socialist that has a picture of Eugene Debs in a frame-level of commitment to the cause. So I get what you are coming from in your belief system.

Remember, however, that those the shout the loudest on both the left and the right are the ones in the minority.  If they were the majority, they wouldn't need to shout.  The extreme minority always shouts the loudest, like the bleating of a sheep against the rain and winds of nature herself.

Many people on the left and right, especially on the far out fringes, have a need to out-liberal or out-conservative those around them.  I'm more ""this"" (PC, Worker's Rights, Pro-Christ, whatever...) than you, and that makes me to superior to you.  Those people are not rational in the sense that you can change their views, because their views will change - but only to the next extreme position on the political spectrum when it becomes the cause de jour for their political affiliation.

To put that into context, you see extreme liberals screaming about about trans-gendered rights because their most recent cause, Gay Rights, has ended.  But you see none of them arguing for polygamy, which is surprising as that is a very logical leap and follows the much the same philosophical arguments as the Gay Marriage movement.  But polygamy isn't on their radar because it's not ""cool"" yet.  Perhaps it'll be cool in a couple of years - then it's all about the megaphone and how they were on the issue first, long before their fellow liberals saw the injustice on behalf of ""Group P"" they have a reason to rally for.

The echo chamber of intelligent debate that is social media like twitter and facebook forces the conversation into shock tactic-like statements designed to be heard over then din of other tweets that support the same thing but are not written by those that need to be right/better than those around them.

The world is indeed a strange place out on the fringes of the political spectrum, and while I reside here, I tend not to talk to my neighbors because they aren't too neighborly.  They want to out-liberal me in a contest of PC-ness and other things that are frankly, dehumanizing towards all of humanity.

Reducing people from society into roles, like ""white"", ""black"", ""gay"", conservative"", allows for people to separate individuals from the group of humanity, and demand that we treat everyone in group ""A"" as equals.  That's all well and good if you are group ""A"", but what about group ""X""?  Most educated people on the extremes of the left find that the ""Throw a Brick Through a McDonald's Window to Protest the WTO"" aren't wrong, they're just assholes.

And, literally like assholes, they don't really think through their shit - they just try to get it out as quickly as possible while giving them the most comfortable result that allows them to feel better.

Also, fuck the IMF, amiright?  Oh, sorry - the IMF was *so* the 2006 issue for the liberals.","&gt;I was, am and will be a dyed-in-the-patchouli liberal. I was ecstatic that gays can get married now. I will call Caitlyn Jenner whatever SHE wants me to. I'm a big fan of Bernie Sanders.*I absolutely believe all fortysomething of Bill Cosby's accusers.*

One of these things is not like the others.  (100% with you on those first four, btw). And herein lies the problem that you're talking about.  *Why* do you believe them, despite having only heresay and no solid evidence to rely on?  

Because you've conflated the idea of their victimhood with your own open-minded liberalness.  You think that to question them would be to reject your *political* beliefs.   That not taking them for their word would betray your principles.   This is an ideological response; and psychologically speaking it is very similar to the reaction religiously devout people have to something that violates the rules of their religion (Such as why so many Christians are mad that gay marriage is now legal).   

In reality, though without doubt it is highly likely that at least *some* of those women are telling the truth, you and I cannot possibly know that, and so to say that you ""absolutely"" believe *all* of them reflects that you *absolutely* do not want anyone to question where you stand on that issue, lest they challenge your ideological purity/sincerity, or worse: Accuse you of being a bigot.  You aren't just a bad person for not sharing their views, You don't share their views *because you're a bad person*.   There are remarkable parallels between the radical left and the religious fundamentalist in this regard.  

That's the problem: It's ideological.   Not rational, not even about what's right or wrong.  Political extremism is about ""US"" vs ""Them"".  And ideological purity is expected by radicals.   Social pressure deters people from questioning, criticizing, or disagreeing.    To suggest that maybe we should wait until we know the facts before judging is tantamount to being a rape apologist and a misogynist to the far-left crowd.    

Then there's the media.   Washington Post, Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, etc.   These publications primarily generate readership by pandering to those extremists.   Washington Post is to Liberalism what Jezebel is to women's equality.   

I won't even get into the tumblr/twitter ""opression olympics""  (as a gay man, I am allowed to have *some* opinions, but they're not as valid as say, a gay *woman*, because she is by virtue of being female more oppressed than me, etc.)  

Ideological extremism ceases to be about justice, or right and wrong, or even the *truth*.   In radical politics, the truth will always be viewed through the funhouse mirror of the ideologue.  

The key is to step back from the labels, and from what you've been *told* to believe, and just start thinking about the foundational goals of social justice.   That everyone should have equal standing under the law, equal opportunities and equal protections within our society.   That the horrors and injustices of history ( and the present day) must be stopped, and the damage done corrected as much as this can possibly be done.     

We have to get away from ideology and indoctrination, and encourage people to use their brains.   Then it will become apparent who really wants a better world, and who is just looking out for their own selfish desires.",A,A,"I would say that reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a thoughtful analysis of the ideological extremism that can be present in social justice movements, pointing out the dangers of conflating personal beliefs with political ideology. It encourages the original poster to step back from labels and think critically about the foundational goals of social justice. This approach is more likely to resonate with someone who is feeling conflicted about the current state of PC/Social Justice mentality and may prompt them to reconsider their views. In contrast, reply A focuses more on the behavior of extremists on both sides of the political spectrum, which may not address the original poster's concerns as directly."
predict-explain,"I've never understood the vehemence of popular opinion against the hydrogen airship. People balk at the idea of flying around in something filled with explosive gas, yet it seems to me that airliners, when they go wrong, are often just as (or more) fatal to their occupants. The Hindeburg disaster only killed just over a third of the people on board; the majority of airliner crashes kill everyone on board. Overall, the death toll of conventional airplanes, though small, has vastly exceeded that of airships, yet it is airships that retain the reputation of being death-traps. 

The truth is, airships were an idea that was completely out of step with its times; during the period where they were most economically viable, materials and engine technology, among many other things, were barely adequate to deal with their demands. An airship built to Zeppelin scales with modern materials technology and design techniques would be dramatically stronger, lighter, faster and safer, with aramid fibre skins stretched over composite frames. They would have satellite navigation and meteorology, and onboard weather radar to avoid dangerous weather; computerised systems would monitor hydrogen pressure and static build-ups, modern escape and fire suppression systems would provide a final back-up. Moreover, there is the potential to use solar power and electric motors to run these flying behemoths essentially for free, making them far more economically viable, both for passengers who don't mind a slower, more stately trip and for container cargo. You might even be able to use onboard generated power to crack water to produce hydrogen to replenish losses, though I'm not sure how feasible that would be.

Also, it's very hard to deny that airships are really fucking cool.

One such application is [military transport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhVBuBgfXrE). (Under permissive tactical conditions mostly, I would assume). Airships like the one in the video have the excellent advantage of being able to lift huge cargo loads over land (albeit slowly) and unloading their cargo without any infrastructure (like cargo handling equipment, a runway, personnel). Using a rigid airship for disaster relief in locations where all the transportation industry has been destroyed (or never existed) is a perfect application.

The slow speed makes this impractical for commercial transport applications.","They are slow, stupidly huge, a lot more fragile than planes, the useful mass/volume to total mass/volume ratios are obscenely low, they are very susceptible to metereological conditions (a strong wind will blow them back), and they aren't even that incredibly efficient fuel wise (using solar is NOT viable in any shape or form, especially considering that they are slow, the night has no sunlight, and they fly lower than most clouds) to make the idea interesting for niche applications",B,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides specific examples of niche applications where airships could be beneficial, such as military transport and disaster relief. It also acknowledges the limitations of airships, such as their slow speed, but suggests practical uses for them in scenarios where speed is not the primary concern. By offering real-world examples and practical applications, Reply A presents a more compelling argument for the reintroduction of airships in certain contexts.

On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the drawbacks and limitations of airships without offering as many potential benefits or use cases. While it highlights valid concerns about airship efficiency and susceptibility to weather conditions, it does not provide as strong of a case for the potential advantages of using airships in specific scenarios.

Overall, Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view by presenting a more balanced perspective on the potential benefits and limitations of airships."
predict-explain,"Given that livestock consume more water, feed, create more greenhouse gasses, and suffer throughout their lives to eventually be killed, while providing no essential nutrients* that cant be attained through plants, is there any morally justifiable reason to eat meat other than hedonism or (environmental or otherwise) apathy?

*B12 is, as many don't know, not attained directly from meat, but from contaminated water and faeces which are consumed by animals. As humans we can take the choice to drink contaminated water, kill animals or... consume fortified foods and supplements

*Iron is available in many plants and pulses


I should add that I've been a religious meat-eater for most of my life until only ~6-8 weeks ago","The only ""moral"" reason you have listed is that animals suffer throughout their lives before being butchered. What if they don't suffer? What if they graze happily in a field until someone sneaks up on them and provides a painless death? They probably had a much better life in the safety of the pasture than trying to live out in the wild.

The ""consumes more water, food, etc"" only means it's inefficient, and I don't think efficiency of food is a good moral argument. There are many non-meat products that take many more resources to grow; do you oppose those as well?","Just because someone lives in the first world doesn't meant they have the choice to eat vegan. Many people do not have the resources, knowledge, or intelligence to eat a well balanced vegan diet. There is a huge problem with food deserts especially in inner cities. People often times find it prohibitively expensive (money and timewise) to prepare vegan foods. And in some areas it is extremely difficult to find tofu, nutritional yeast, and other supplements for a vegan diet. 

For example for many of our homeless population, they don't get a choice in the food they eat. You eat what is served at the soup kitchen or you starve.",B,A,"I would say that reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A addresses the issue of animal suffering and presents a scenario where animals have a better life before being painlessly killed for consumption. This challenges the original poster's argument that animals suffer throughout their lives. Additionally, reply A questions the moral argument of food efficiency, which makes the original poster reconsider their stance on the environmental impact of meat consumption. Overall, reply A provides a thoughtful and logical response that may prompt the original poster to reconsider their views on eating meat."
predict-explain,"First, let me clarify that by education I mean K-undergraduate.  

Medicine and education are two major components of a social system. In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I believe they should be free for several reasons:

- One's health is essentially a genetic lottery. You shouldn't be punished because you were unlucky enough to develop cancer or be born with a blood disease

- Health can be a direct result of economic conditions and people should not be punished because of the quality and quantity of food their parent(s) provide.

- Education is essentially an economic lottery. If you don't have enough money to pay for college, good luck. Many people are only able to take out student loans because of a cosigner (or their parents outright pay it). Parent's don't have the credit? Your shit out of luck.

- Education is the foundation for the future of society. Forget job opportunities for now, higher education provides valuable skills that cannot be learned anywhere else. By not providing equal opportunities, we are decreasing the intelligence of the population.

- By educating the population, especially the poor, we will decrease crime as well. As of now, many poor kids know they'll never go to college even before they reach high school. By giving equal opportunity, kids will have incentive to stay in school and stay out of trouble. At least they *can* go to college.

- By not providing free education and health care, we are putting our population into a deeper hole of debt, crime and stupidity. A smart and healthy population can contribute to society much more than the status quo (in America). 

Essentially, education and health are lotteries. Some get lucky while most don't. People should not be punished because of this. Investing money into an infrastructure that provides free education and health care is the basis for an advanced society.

Do they take reasonable care of their diet and exercise?

I'm asking because when you say that, ""You shouldn't be punished because you were unlucky enough to develop cancer or be born with a blood disease,"" it's also true that not everyone who gets cancer is unlucky. People are often irresponsible and their actions have a severe effect on healthcare costs. Those people who smoke, don't exercise, etc. are more likely to require expensive medical interventions.

I absolutely agree with you that both education and healthcare are very important and do require public investment because they provide valuable benefits, but some of your logic is flawed. Is it really fair for those who do take care of their health to sacrifice future resources that they may require because someone who doesn't have good habits requires more resources?","In an ideal world, sure but so is having no homeless people.  The thing is that even when you see places with public healthcare and education, there are still the same problems.   

I'm assuming your talking about the U.S.  There is free public education to before undergrad, but would expanding it to college really make the overall population smarter? High school education is the bare minimum for people to get work and usually the prospect isn't great. Making college public would basically make it the new high school. Standards will drop as it will essentially be mandatory.  Your still going to have the same divide with education as you do now.  It's just that bar is slightly higher.

Reply A brings up the valid point that not everyone who develops health issues is simply unlucky, as some individuals may have contributed to their own health problems through poor lifestyle choices. This challenges the original poster's argument that everyone should have free healthcare regardless of personal responsibility. By highlighting the potential unfairness of asking those who take care of their health to sacrifice resources for those who do not, Reply A introduces a nuanced perspective that may cause the original poster to reconsider their stance on the issue.

On the other hand, Reply B's argument focuses more on the practical challenges and potential downsides of implementing free healthcare and education.

Therefore, Reply A is more likely to prompt the original poster to consider different aspects of the issue and potentially change their view."
predict-explain,"I have played Hearthstone since its beta and have had great times with it (I still do).

My massive issue with the game is that the current meta relies too heavily on strung together mech cards that perfectly mesh with each other and do no evoke a skill-based theme or tactic. The expansion has encouraged players to make decks that kill quickly before the game can even begin to get interesting; this avoids the entirety of what makes Hearthstone special.

Another thing is that Legendaries are totally whack as a core concept. They come off as useful tools to take out foes but are secretly a ploy to get ""consumers"" to buy packs to try and earn them (in a free-to-play game). The rarity of these cards even further prove that it benefits those who purchase packs in bulk and get them quicker, letting them get ""better"" faster and leave other players in the dust.

Blizzard has also recently lowered the chance of getting decent dailies, meaning you have a lower chance of generating in game currency, further benefiting the payers.

Cards involving random chance while also altering the mana curve (Voidcaller, Unstoppable Portal, Alarm-o-Bot) are devastating and should not exist. This is different than Druid's mana increasing cards as this is a calculated strategy that is understood by the opponent.

I have never recieved a new pack of YGO-cards because I won against an opponent 10 times, I had to go to the store, buy a new pack and hope for the best.

If I didn't expand my library than that meant I was stuck with all the strategies I currently had.

Of course payers will have an edge and there is nothing wrong with that. That is the nature of CCG/TCG's.

If you want some solace though, it all comes back to the time vs. value conversation.

If your time is more worth to you than your money, you are more likely to spend some bucks for progress than the other way around.

and if you want another solace, the game is already free to play and of superb-quality, if you dish out 50$, it's as if you bought a new game at retail price for which you can get a decent value out of, if you calculate $-spent/h-played.","Meta's get established in any game, but in card games its very easy to see optimum strategies. As a result, in constructed you see really focused decks that are always going to be annoying. Zoolock, current mech cards, there will likely never be a utopia of strategy in a single block of hearthstone, just like in MTG.


A meta will always get figured out, and grow stale. The solution is an expansion. It shakes up the meta and throws a bunch of new strategies at players. Playing around a new expansion drop is probably the most fun time to play the game.


The game does benefit paying players in constructed a lot, but it's still a much more customer friendly than any traditional card game (Again, like MTG). I think it's awesome that it's entirely possible to play the game without monetary investment.


Thankfully, there is a solution built into the game for both of these problems: The arena!",A,A,"I would say reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B acknowledges the issues raised by the original poster, such as the dominance of certain strategies in the meta and the advantage paying players have in constructed play. However, it also offers a solution in the form of the arena mode, which allows players to compete on a more level playing field regardless of their card collection. Additionally, it highlights the excitement and freshness that comes with new expansions, which can shake up the meta and introduce new strategies. Overall, reply B provides a more balanced perspective and offers solutions to the concerns raised by the original poster."
predict-explain,"Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, for example:

1. My child, my choice. Well, yes. And this is the closest one to a valid argument, IMO. But of course we put limits on what parents are allowed to do and choose for their children; you can't deprive your child of food or education (in the US) and be allowed to keep your child, so clearly it is NOT all your choice. While refusing vaccines is nowhere near on that level, not EVERY possible choice is equally acceptable, because your child is a person, not a piece of property. If the child had the capacity to refuse, I might be swayed, but unfortunately young babies can't understand vaccines on any reasonable level. And, more importantly, it IS still your choice under school vaccination schemes; you can choose to homeschool your child, or send them to private schools that don't care. Those choices aren't available to everyone and that's unfortunate (for far more important reasons than this), but...that's our current system anyway. Being rich gets you all kinds of benefits. I don't think this is different from being able to buy better medical care, better schools, better food, private tutors, and worlds more for your child if you have the resources (I do support basic income, which would alleviate this issue, but that's neither here nor there as we haven't got it). Public schools are a governmental service, and there are rules about who can and cannot use them. I think it is fine to say only vaccinated (or medically exempt) people can use them.

2. Not everyone can get vaccinated. That's why doctors are able to issue waivers for those not medically right for vaccination. This already happens and should continue.

3. Vaccines are dangerous. Not as dangerous as rampant infection. Honestly this is its own debate...But suffice it to say you are going to need some pretty major evidence to possibly CMV. I don't think it exists, but I won't rule it out. I don't really want to talk about vaccine efficacy as it has been done to death, but I guess if there's some truly amazing evidence...

4. Everyone is entitled to an education. They still are. Any unvaccinated child either needs to attend a non-public education option, be homeschooled or eschooled, provide a medical certificate that says they shouldn't be vaccinated, or get the shots. I don't necessarily have a strong view on the best way to handle noncompliance, and don't know enough about policy to say what would be most effective and just. Maybe fines for the parents? The same punishment as parents who refuse to send their kids to school or teach them at home for other reasons? I would not support removing the child from the home or incarcerating the parents, or any other severe punishment.

What would change my view: evidence that such a policy would have clear public health risks, would unavoidably keep children from getting an education, or would have some other major negative effect on society. I also am open to the idea that it is fundamentally unjust, though it doesn't seem that way to me right now.

Edit: My post focuses mainly on why I think mandatory vaccination isn't bad, but it occurred to me that it might be helpful to say why I think it's good. Mainly, I think it's good because it protects those who cannot be vaccinated and the minority of children for whom the vaccine was ineffective or wore off sooner than it ""should have"" based on medical guidelines. Children should be safe at school, and I think this promotes safety in a significant way--since children can die of preventable illness.

Edit2: If vaccines are prohibitively expensive and can't be obtained for free, this system is pretty shit for poor families. In my area you can get free vaccines in certain conditions, which are very lenient. If this isn't true everywhere in the US (and it almost certainly  isn't), it should be before vaccines are made mandatory.

Edit3: Going to bed now, will respond to new posts tomorrow. If it blows up, I might not get to everyone, but I will try to address any new points that are brought to the table.","So I do think this policy I justified, but I don't think it's a good mechanism for mandatory vaccination.

The people who insist on not vaccinating their children do so because they think it would be harmful for their child, and some of them probably hold this belief strong enough so that they would not enroll their children in school. Are anti-vaxxers really the people you want homeschooling children? The comparison here is, with mandatory vaccinations, hundreds of kids have their lives ruined by leaving school each year. Without them, maybe once every decade, less than a hundred kids will get sick for a few weeks. 

But the problem is also worse than that, because this also plays into a lot of anti-vaxxer rhetoric. A lot of it relies on exploiting people's fears of the government. Mandatory vaccines only make that seem worse. Additionally, it makes these people even less trusting of the government, meaning that they are more likely to shut themselves of from outside streams of information. So it forces many anti-vaxxers into even more of an echo chamber. One of the must successful ways to spread information is to have anti-vaxxers have a friend or a neighbor who can discuss these things with them. The easiest way to prevent that from happening is by forcing them further away from the rest of society.","As much as I hate defending the anti-vaccine crowd, I think the problem with mandatory vaccination for public school is that school is also compulsory. Ever since No Child Left Behind, education has been mandatory for all children until 16 or 18 (can't remember). Now the same people who demandon't children be sent to school also demand that in order to go to school, they must be vaccinated. 

Now, now you might say, that's only for public schools, what about private schools and home/eschooling? There's a problem with that too. Roughly 40% of children in the US live in single parent home, which rules out the prospect of homeschooling and eschooling becomes unviable because it's illegal to leave your kids alone at home. You also have a large percentage of the population who can't afford or don't have access to private schools. The amount of overlap here has the potential to be very high, especially in poor neighborhoods. 

So, now we have a segment of the population for whom public school is the only option. What are the odds that some of these people do not want their kids vaccinated, for whatever reason (ignorance usually, but that's not the point)? Pretty high. So now the question becomes, are we willing to fine and or imprison parents because they don't want their kid to get a vaccine and therefore won't send them to school? Personally, that is not something I'm willing to do, so I'm against mandatory vaccination in order to go to school.",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A presents a strong argument against mandatory vaccination for public schools by highlighting the potential negative consequences of forcing anti-vaxxers to homeschool their children. It addresses the issue of trust in the government and the potential for further isolation of anti-vaxxers, which could exacerbate the problem. Additionally, it points out the importance of having open communication channels to potentially change minds, which mandatory vaccination could hinder. 

On the other hand, Reply B focuses on the issue of compulsory education and the potential limitations for families who cannot afford private schools or do not have the option of homeschooling. While these are valid points, Reply A provides a more nuanced and persuasive argument that addresses the potential unintended consequences of mandatory vaccination."
predict-explain,"I have recently been told that my pro-life position is ""forcing my ideas on others"".  I believe that it is not or that if it is then it is necessary.  This "" forcing ideals on others"" is an argument I hear often and I just want to understand it better. I believe that a fetus is a human being. I confess, that is my view, not everyone's view. I believe an abortion is the murder of that child. This is still my view. Not everyone's. United States law entitles all humans to life. Passing legislation opposing abortion is simply following that idea in my way. I am not forcing anyone to agree with me. I am simply making sure the law is followed as I read it. 

For a hypothetical:

It's 1870 and there is a white who believes that black people are subhuman (not so uncommon at the time). If I say no they are not subhuman. They are human beings and I will prosecute you if you kill them am I "" forcing my ideals on them"" or am I simply protecting what I believe to be human life. And even if I am ""forcing my ideals"" on the man isn't it necessary to do so?  

The abortion debate is a matter of whether the fetus is indeed entitled to the rights of a living human. It has nothing to do with a group forcing it's ideas on another and such statements are only used to unjustly vilify the pro-life movement.","You've asked this a few times: ""would you agree that ""forcing your ideas on others"" is not a fair attack on pro-life legislation?""

No, I don't agree. It's absolutely a fair attack, because of the word ""ideas"" (or alternatively, ""beliefs"").

In our society and in common language, the word ""idea"" or ""belief"" is not applied to a concept that is - for all intents and purposes - universally agreed upon. Most people would not say the phrase ""murder is wrong"" is an ""idea"" or a ""belief"". Because basically everyone (except murderers) agrees on that, we talk about it as more of an objective **fact**. An underlying assumption we all have, that we then use for further discussion.

Please note that this doesn't mean something IS objective fact simply because everyone, or almost everyone, agrees. I'm just saying that's how we as a society tend to treat these topics.

On the other hand, when there is significant disagreement on a subject, the viewpoints of one side (or one person) IS generally referred to as an ""idea"" or ""belief"". So when people say pro-lifers are trying to force their ideas on everyone else, that's a fair statement. 

The converse isn't really true, either. You couldn't say that pro-choice people are ""forcing their beliefs"" because by definition, that side is advocating for choice. They are not saying you CAN'T do something, or saying you MUST do something. They are simply saying that the choice should exist. Offering someone that choice might offend you, but you are nonetheless not being forced to do anything.","The fetus is, until birth, a parasite. This is true even if we all agree that it is a person. US law entitles all humans to life but it does *not* entitle humans to use other people's bodies without their consent. Forcing them to do so *is* forcing your ideas on others in every sense of the phrase.",A,A,"I would say that reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a different perspective on the issue by framing the fetus as a parasite and highlighting the importance of bodily autonomy. This argument challenges the original poster's belief that abortion is murder and instead focuses on the rights of the pregnant person. By presenting a different viewpoint and emphasizing bodily autonomy, reply B may prompt the original poster to reconsider their stance on the issue."
predict-explain,"Hey,

So I always read about space debris as this big crisis or this problem that is something people are really worried about.... this just doesn't make any sense to me. 

It seems to me that if we could view all orbiting matter on a single plane the size of even the earth's crust it would be very clear that space debris is not an immediate issue. The amount of debris relative to the size of the area is not that much... not even taking into account that it isn't happening on a plane but in 3-D space.

Why is this wrong with this? I guess this doesn't take into account gravity (the gravitational pull of a satellite may be substantial at orbit - making collision highly likely). Or perhaps the scale of damage even a bolt could have.. but these to me seem so remote....

Over the next, 20 years we will launch a lot more satellites - but only/maybe then they may become an issue - but at the present time it's like talking about not getting in your car because you are worried about drunk drivers - it may be acceptable but it is not rational

This is because Reply A provides a clear explanation of the Kessler syndrome, which is a well-known concept in space debris research. The idea that a single collision can create a cascade of debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions is a compelling argument for why space debris is a real and immediate issue. Additionally, the comparison of orbital speeds to the velocity of bullets helps to emphasize the potential danger of even small pieces of debris in space.

predict-explain,"I believe that we are at the point where we potentially *could* avoid bringing about catastrophic climate change, but to do that we would need to drop absolutely everything, to change our lifestyles in the most dramatic of ways, and we would need to unify and mobilize everybody to address this issue (at the expense of almost everything else).

And I believe that it's too late for us to do this because it would take changes so dramatic that the people who are most invested in society as it is today (the rich and powerful) would resist it will everything they have. A lack of serious committments and changes is indicative of this.


I believe that we are on the brink of a number of tipping points, if we haven't already passed them:


* The melting of the polar ice caps (including rain at polar areas and the landslide effect of snowmelt destabilizing ice sheets causing them to break up plunge into the ocean well before they would even melt) meaning that the sheets which used to reflect sunlight away from the Earth will be gone. Along with that is the albedo flip where as the ice melts and pools of water accumulate on the top of ice sheets, they become a sort of heatsink, absorbing solar energy and causing nearby ice to melt, creating further pools of water. The melting of frozen methane escaping into the atmosphere is a similar effect which will cause another feedback loop as methane is a much more effective greenhouse gas, in orders of magnitude (is it 40x?) above carbon dioxide.


* Oceanic acdification threatening to grind not only oxygen production to a virtual standstill but also threatening to destroy the very foundation of oceanic life by removing the ability for the cornerstone of the oceanic foodchain, phytoplankton, to form. If this happens, then the natural cycle of nutrients from the oceans to the waterways back to the land will come to a grinding halt, meaning that the once rich and fertile liminal lands along coastlines will become barren and waterways will end up eutrophying and becoming undrinkable.


* The destruction of peat bogs and/or the reduction of the capacity of peat bogs to keep the carbon they contain sequestered.


* Runaway forest fires causing feedback loops as the hotter and drier the world gets, the more likely severe forest fires will be which will in turn increase the carbon in the atmosphere.


* The potential for rainforest ecosystems to collapse thereby increasìng atmospheric carbon while ceasing to function as carbon sinks.


* Desertification rapidly increasing due to increased temperatures and reduced/erratic rainfall thereby reducing plant life and the ability for ecosystems to absorb carbon dioxide.


* The potential for climate change to affect the ability of cloud formation and water vapor to reflect sunlight.


But the biggest factor in all of this, and the one tipping point which we have already passed is this one &amp;mdash; the social tipping point. (Granted this is hypothetical and I admit that it's difficult to argue against speculation and prognostication.) 

What I see as the social tipping point is the part where people stop caring because they feel entirely powerless to affect any change, where governments choose not to act for leverage (political/financial etc.), where governments and corporations choose not to act in order to preserve/increase profits, where the food supply gets put under more pressure due changes in climate (extremes, predictability, rainfall etc.) and so people will be less interested in eating locally or sustainably and more interested in just trying to get enough food, where electricity usage will skyrocket as people try to maintain a comfortable temperature indoors while it's either baking or freezing outside, where we will be faced with increasingly severe humanitarian crises (water shortages, coastal flooding, islands being submerged, famines etc.), where wars over resources will only increase, and the sum of these social feedback loops will cripple our ability to focus on ways to address runaway climate change because we will be dealing with other more urgent issues that cannot be ignored.

The reason that I believe we have passed this so-called social tipping point is because collectively we have not only failed to halt carbon emissions, but instead we have only been increasing them. If there were hope for us to achieve serious change in order to avert catastrophic climate change, it would be indicated by the countries of the world rallying to make carbon emissions simply plateau. But we can't even do that. So I believe that it's too late for the world to not only stop the increase of carbon emissions, but that it's too late to be able to bring about the dramatic changes in lifestyles/living standards etc. required to avoid either increasing carbon emissions (which is a catastrophe) or simply halting carbon emissions where they are right now (which is a catastrophe).


And I think that as we have surpassed this social tipping point, it will cause feedback loops in society as well as in the environment which will push us increasingly faster down a path of catastrophic climate change.


N.B.: I'm not saying that humans are fundamentally incapable of changing the way they live their lives and their environmental impact. I'm not saying that life will be extinguished altogether, in fact I'm not even saying that humans as a species won't survive, but I'm saying that our societies and our progress almost certainly will not survive. I'm not saying that if we all pulled together and put *everything* we had into averting catastrophic climate change we couldn't stop it. I'm not saying that a revolution that sweeps the globe and changes the fundamental nature of the way society organizes itself around production, consumption, and our relation to the environment couldn't stop this. And I'm not saying that there won't be the potential for some miracle techno-fix that will save everything in the eleventh hour. I'm saying that for us to have anything more than the most infinitesimally small chance that we might be able to save ourselves from climate change somehow that we would need to have already made big strides on this front, and the way that the world is geared means that we are effectively stuck barrelling towards catastrophic climate change in an ever-accelerating manner and that this is demonstrated by us not being able to put the brakes on now, and that's without even trying to put it into reverse (to overstretch the metaphor).

Please, please change my view.

**Edit**: View changed!


[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3gb6h1/cmv_i_believe_that_it_is_too_late_for_humans_to/ctwso7w) made me realize that big changes could be brought about through a number of ways without the climate getting so bad that we'd need to be neck deep in seawater.


I'm still skeptical that we'll be able to pull it off, and I still think that there are a ton of hazards that our current economic system presents us with which we will need to address, but if the circumstances were right (e.g. strong carbon taxes, ratifying the Kyoto treaty, a functional emissions trading market etc.) we really *could* reduce carbon emissions as well as atmospheric carbon in a practical and realistic way that would avert catastrophic climate change.

In another comment there's a link to a recent /r/science AMA on climate change which addressed how I was buying into alarmism when the reality doesn't actually seem quite so dire when you look at the evidence. At least not yet anyway.

 Between those two comments in particular, my view has been changed.","I don't think catastrophic climate change is for certain. Let me spin you a pollyanna story. I'm not saying it will happen, but it might ....  

The main environmental problem of our time is the use of fossil fuels (coal, petroleum and natural gas) for *energy*. About half of our energy use is via electricity, coal (the worse offender in terms of global warming) is mainly used for electricity generation. Petroleum is used mainly for transportation. [Chart](https://www.llnl.gov/sites/default/files/field/image/28228_flowcharthighres.png) 

First, let's assume the cost of wind and solar energy keeps on dropping at [10 to 15% per year](http://cleantechnica.com/2014/04/16/solars-dramatic-cost-fall-may-herald-energy-price-deflation/). On the profit principle alone, companies stop building new fossil fuel electricity generation plants; within the next ten years, they start decommissioning old fossil fuel power plants because it's cheaper to produce using wind and solar. By 2050, almost all the fossil fuel power plants are gone, and no one burns coal (the dirtiest fuel) anymore.  

Second, suppose the [drop in production costs for lithium-ion batteries accelerates](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/energy_resources_materials/battery_technology_charges_ahead). Over the next 5 years, costs drop by more than half. This makes it cheaper to build a electric car than a petrol-fueled car. Manufacturers and consumers shift over to electric cars en masse, since powering an electric car is so much cheaper than buying petrol for a normal car. The cheaper rechargeable batteries also solve the problem of how to smooth-out the variability of power generation from a wind-and-solar-based grid. Almost everyone has something like a [Tesla Powerwall](http://rt.com/business/256521-tesla-battery-big-business/) hanging in their garage, and hooked up to their mains.

Third, and this is the most iffy, sometime in the next 10 years, all major countries ratify the [Kyoto accord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol) and start taking it seriously. They increase taxes on fossil fuels and impose punitive duties on imports from countries that do not abide by the accord. The cost of using coal and petroleum rise. Because of taxes, coal becomes too expensive to use compared to cheaper alternatives, and coal mines shut down. Petroleum use gradually declines, as companies and consumers find cheaper alternatives. 

By 2050, electricity production no longer uses fossil fuels, and electric cars have largely taken over the roads. Petroleum is mainly used for aviation and shipping. However, increasing taxation and continued progress on biofuels gradually wean these industries from petroleum, and [airlines and ships move over to using biofuels](https://www.iata.org/pressroom/facts_figures/fact_sheets/pages/alt-fuels.aspx). The US military enthusiatically embraces biofuels, as the supply is less vulnerable to disruption. 

By 2060, the world has largely stopped using fosil fuels. Air pollution is a thing of the past, and urban emphysema and lung cancer rates drop. World population [peaks at 8 billion in 2050, and stabilizes.](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/04/130404072923.htm) Increased agricultural productivity, higher GDP, and a stabilizing world population, allows countries to put environmental issues on the fron burner. Climate change increases rainfall over sub-saharan Africa, leading to the greening of the Sahara. In regions where climate change reduced rainfall, [new desalination technologies mitigate the worst effects.](http://e360.yale.edu/feature/new_desalination_technologies_spur_growth_in_recycling_water/2770/) Economic development moves people to urban areas, forests regrow, and mankind becomes carbon-negative for the first time since the industrial revolution.","I do share some of your fears, but you also need to trust in advances in science and engineering to solve many of the problems. Renewable energy is increasingly competitive and a lot of money and research is going into making it the default option. As fossil fuels become more scarce they will become more expensive, which will further tip the equation in favour of renewables. I also believe that increasingly, advances in science that reverse some of the effects of climate change are not beyond our reach.

I also believe that when whole societies start to feel the financial downsides of climate change they will start to act. It's somewhat depressing that people in comfortable Westernised societies aren't moved by melting ice-caps or displaced groups of poor people on the far side of the world, but are when home insurance premiums go up every year because of regular flooding of coastal or low-lying areas. Either way, as I believe that as people start to witness tangible impacts, funding for scientific research will increase, people will accept more legislation to e.g. impose heavy taxes on carbon-heavy things, and so on. 

The bit I can't offer you much comfort over is the effect on marine life - yes, it may be that we are doing untold damage there, and coupled with over-fishing it paints a bleak picture. We are already living through one of the world's great extinctions, which again is largely down to mankind's effect on the planet.

My great hope is that as the people of the world get to know each other better they will work together better. The internet, primarily, is changing the world for the better - people around the world are connected in ways they never were, and a lot of the traditional divisions between socieities - religions, nationality, language etc - are breaking down, meaning that people are able to come together to make things happen in new ways. I would hope that before too long the whole world can come together to plan how to run this planet properly - we are now powerful enough to destroy ourselves and everything else on this planet if we don't learn some kind of husbandry on a planetary level, so sooner or later we'll have to start working together to shape the planet we want, including how we re-build animal and plant life to a level that benefits mankind.

And one final thought to cheer you up: my parents' generation were genuinely terrified of nuclear war, terrified that they would get a 4-minute warning to hide under their desks before they were turned into a ball of fire. So firstly, be grateful that climate change being our biggest threat at least doesn't mean you're going to be turned into a ball of fire in your own home, but also see recent nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation treaties as evidence that mankind, however much we may disagree, is eventually able to recognise such threats and work together to step back from the brink.",A,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply B acknowledges the concerns and fears of the original poster but offers a more optimistic view by highlighting the potential for advances in science and engineering to solve many of the problems related to climate change. It also emphasizes the potential for societies to act once they start feeling the financial downsides of climate change and mentions the positive impact of global connectivity through the internet in bringing people together to address these issues. Additionally, it offers a historical example of how mankind has come together to address significant threats in the past, such as nuclear war. 

Overall, Reply B provides a more hopeful and proactive perspective on addressing climate change, which may be more persuasive in changing the original poster's view compared to the more speculative and hypothetical scenario presented in Reply A."
predict-explain,"Reddit is a website, a business, it is the ""front page of the internet"".

This front page doesn't have to house hate speech or hostile ideologies. I think removing these will only make reddit a more positive and progressive place to be. 

I think free speech can flourish without hate speech. I think we can recognize accurately the INTENTION of certain subreddits. Some can be gross, negative or downright morbid but don't have ill intentions but I think its the intention that matters and I feel from the [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/) that those subreddits with vile intetions will be removed while other ""alternative"" subreddits will be just fine.

I think certain viruses have an intention to spread through the body and I think some subreddits here can be likened to viruses so I can only see a positive outcome when extracting these viruses out of the community.

predict-explain,"I've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form.

The facts are:

* McDonalds brewed (and continues to brew) coffee at standard brewing temperatures of 200F 
* McDonalds holds and serves its coffee after brewing between 170-180F (which is no different than most other restaurants)
* McDonalds has *NOT* lowered the temperature of their coffee, nor have the changed the temps at which they hold and serve coffee

To me, the purchaser of coffee acknowledges the fact that they're buying near-boiling water when they decided ""hey, I want coffee"". Change my view, please.

[sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants)


EDIT:

Looks like I screwed up by questioning the frivolousness of the case. Even if the blame doesn't lie on McDonalds, the case does not seem to be frivolous in the slightest. This was an easy one. Thanks guys.","&gt; McDonalds brewed (and continues to brew) coffee at standard brewing temperatures of 200F 

Why does it matter? They can brew it at 1,000,000 degrees. What matter is how they serve it.

&gt; McDonalds holds and serves its coffee after brewing between 170-180F (which is no different than most other restaurants)

&gt; McDonalds has NOT lowered the temperature of their coffee, nor have the changed the temps at which they hold and serve coffee


This is false. Most fast food restaurants serve their coffee at substantially lower temperatures.

""The company has refused to disclose today’s standard temperature, but Retro Report shows a handbook for franchisees calling for temperatures 10 degrees lower."" 

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/21/booming/not-just-a-hot-cup-anymore.html?_r=0

Also, from the wiki you cited  ""McDonald's claimed that the reason for serving such hot coffee in its drive-through windows was that those who purchased the coffee typically were commuters who wanted to drive a distance with the coffee; the high initial temperature would keep the coffee hot during the trip.[2] However, the company's own research showed that some customers intend to consume the coffee immediately while driving.[3]""

&gt;To me, the purchaser of coffee acknowledges the fact that they're buying near-boiling water when they decided ""hey, I want coffee"". 

No, most fast food consumers want coffee to drink immediately, not coffee they need to spend time waiting to consume.

"" The plaintiffs argued that Appleton conceded that McDonald's coffee would burn the mouth and throat if consumed when served.[17]""","&gt;McDonalds holds and serves its coffee after brewing between 170-180F **(which is no different than most other restaurants)**

This is factually incorrect.  [During research for the trial, Danny Jarrett ""found that none came closer than about
20 degrees to the temperature at which McDonald's coffee is poured""](http://www.business.txstate.edu/users/ds26/Business%20Law%202361/Misc/McDonalds%20coffee.pdf).  Research also indicated that such a temperature difference makes a massive difference in the amount of time needed for said coffee to cause burns and therefore the dangers associated with the drink.

Such a difference between McDonald's coffee and other coffee in the city means that a customer has a reasonable expectation for coffee at any given restaurant to be in a similar range of temperature.  By exceeding that range, McDonald's was giving the customer that had a significantly increased risk of injury associated with it without any warning that theirs was different from similar products in other places.",B,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides specific evidence and research that contradicts the original poster's claims about the temperature of McDonald's coffee compared to other restaurants. It also explains the significance of the temperature difference in terms of the risk of injury to customers. This factual information is likely to be more persuasive in changing the original poster's view compared to Reply A, which mainly focuses on refuting the original poster's points without providing as much concrete evidence."
predict-explain,"There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives  and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, others claim that increased government spending (while keeping taxation the same) simulates the economy, but there is no consensus on this point, among economists or politicians. Deficit spending stimulates the economy, but we are already deficit spending, and the national debt is already rather large, so we can't do that forever. Low interest rates stimulate the economy, but elected officials have no direct influence over interest rates -- the Federal Reserve Board does that, and interest rates are already very, very low. New export markets also help, but the U.S. is already committed to several ambitious international trade agreements. Investor confidence helps, a little, maybe, sometimes, but the U.S. stock market is already overpriced. Beyond that, most economic growth comes from increases in productivity, and consumer confidence. Elected officials have no control over these.

If you vote for a candidate who promises to ""create jobs"" or ""grow the economy,"" you're either voting for a liar or a fool. Change my view!

Edit: I'm speaking of the U.S. economy, not the global economy, and I'm speaking of political candidates who might run for office in the near future, not the distant future or the past.

Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*","I think that at least in certain contexts, correct govenrment action can absolutely ""grow the economy"".  At the very least, it can end a recession more quickly.   

We've basically just done the experiment; when the 2007-2009 recession hit, the US did stimulus spending, while the EU mostly did austerity.   Most economists (although not all) would have predicted that stimulus spending in a recession would cause the economy to grow while austerity would actually make it shrink more.  And having done the experiment, I think we can say with a fair degree of confidence that they were correct.   

A lot does depend on the exact details, but I think that govenrment policy can have a very significant effect on the economy; and, if handled properly, a very positive one.    

By the way:

&gt;elected officials have no direct influence over interest rates the Federal Reserve Board does that

The President does appointe the next head of the Fed, and to say he has ""no influence"" is often incorrect.  Some presidents have made sure they had a great deal of influence over the Fed.  Nixon, for example, brought the head of the Fed at the time Arthur F. Burns to Camp David as part of his economic summit, and basically browbeat him into going along with his economic policy (with IMHO disastrous results).","You are in that sense correct that in an economy at capacity, government can usually not produce magic growth (unlike an economy in recession, where government can produce growth).

It can however influence the long term trajectory of growth by strengethening long term market confidence, improving public health, education, produdcing a regulatory enviorment which is friendly to innovation, protecting the economy from large volatility (volatility is generally very costly, for various reasons) or by increasing market effiency (externalities, monopolies etc.).
There are situations were government can easily produce massive frowth (in recessions) and even if not in a recession government regulation can influence long term growth (usually only quite slightly and in a long term). There are even more ways for a government to absolutly wreck an economy.
Ofc in a Pluralistic society it is rather hard for an individual to make a huge difference but I'd argue that you are not correct.

Let's take FDR and the New Deal as an example where the Presidency was the main driver behind the Programm, so it is possible for an individual politician to make a signifcant difference in economic performance (especially in time of crisis).",B,A,"I would say reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because reply A provides a specific example of government action during the 2007-2009 recession and compares the outcomes of stimulus spending in the US versus austerity in the EU. This concrete example demonstrates how government policy can have a significant impact on the economy and potentially change the trajectory of growth. Additionally, reply A also brings up the point that the President can have influence over the Federal Reserve Board, which adds another layer to the argument about government's role in economic growth. Overall, reply A provides more detailed and specific examples to support the argument that government action can influence the economy, making it more persuasive."
predict-explain,"Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. I can't believe rappers are allowed to win grammies and different music awards. Poets should be allowed to win grammies too then. Rap to me is like in the same category as a terrible singer sometimes. 

     Every person on this earth that can speak is capable of rapping. You can't say the same for singers, that can sing on key. You might say, it takes skill to rap well. No it doesn't. It takes time, and a pen and paper. It can be mastered relatively easy. Please show me why they deserve to be respected as musicians.

Edit 1: Okay u/scottevil110 pointed out to me, performing, or the entertainment value is a big part of a rappers act. It takes tremendous confidence and talent to get on stage and move a crowd with your lyrics. Some rappers are capable of this so, i changed my view that some have talent in that regard, but as far as the actual rapping i still believe that i could truthfully be the next Meek, or Young Thug.

Edit 2: Let me clarify what talent is to me. I already know what the webster definition is, the natural ability or aptitude to do something. Let's take young thug as an example and Lamarr. They're both rappers and make good music i like. Everyone who can talk has the ability to come up with the words young thug says, and say it like him in a drunken stupor. So everyone is talented then in some way. Lamar it would take longer, and he has a nice flow, but still it could be easily copied. Now, REAL talent to me, is a perormance like Keyshia Cole singing [Love](  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KTkW636B8xg) one of the greatest songs of all time. Or Peter Green ripping the shit out of a guitar, in songs like, need your love so bad, or [the supernatural](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YoasUjXBkm8_____). That's REAL talent, compared to something like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RAzzv6Ks9nc). REAL talent is something that not your average jor could do. Some are born with it. For some it takes years to become good at it, but it has to have a level of difficulty, in my view, that the average person can't easily attain.

Edit 3: u/glory2hypnotoad showed me writing a full length album on Eminems level does take i guess some real skill. So there are a few rappers who have some real talent. But generally they are untalented. However every singer that can sing on key is talented to me. It's just in a whole 'nother caliber of music to me, for the simple reason it's next to impossible to attain. Comparing Eminem to any singer that can sing on key, is like comparing Iman Shumpert to Lebron James.

Not to mention it takes experience to develop a flow that sounds natural and doesn't have you tripping over yourself trying to rap verses that are lyrically dense and full of tongue-twisters.

predict-explain,"You often hear complaints that a person is a bastard/bitch for breaking up with his/her girlfriend/boyfriend just before/after X event (be it a graduation, Christmas, death in the family etc.). I think that this is entirely unreasonable. If one has made up his/her mind to break it off with a romantic partner, there is no need to delay the inevitable. There will invariably be some reason why ""now is not the best time."" Further, it is dishonest to stay with a person for any length of time after deciding conclusively that ""this person is not right for me and never will be."" Staying in the face of certain relationship termination just to get past X event is unfair to both individuals involved. 

Obviously this train of thought only applies to long-term committed relationships rather than casual or non-exclusive ones.

predict-explain,"I don't particularly hold this view dearly, I just expect there might be some budding historians on Reddit with more information! It was influenced mostly by [this article](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/we-better-off-napoleon-never-lost-waterloo-180955298/?no-ist), which is fascinating if you just fancy some historical reading. Basically, if Napoleon has won at Waterloo, and completed his conquest of Europe (bar Russia, of course, and maybe England), the continent would have flourished economically, socially and politically, more so than now. I will highlight the main points below. 


**1. Revolutionary domestic reforms which all of Europe would have continued to benefit from.**

*""Yet he said he would be remembered not for his military victories, but for his domestic reforms, especially the Code Napoleon, that brilliant distillation of 42 competing and often contradictory legal codes into a single, easily comprehensible body of French law. In fact, Napoleon’s years as first consul, from 1799 to 1804, were extraordinarily peaceful and productive. He also created the educational system based on lycées and grandes écoles and the Sorbonne, which put France at the forefront of European educational achievement. He consolidated the administrative system based on departments and prefects. He initiated the Council of State, which still vets the laws of France, and the Court of Audit, which oversees its public accounts. He organized the Banque de France and the Légion d’Honneur, which thrive today. He also built or renovated much of the Parisian architecture that we still enjoy, both the useful—the quays along the Seine and four bridges over it, the sewers and reservoirs—and the beautiful, such as the Arc de Triomphe, the Rue de Rivoli and the Vendôme column.""*

Napoleon was an extraordinary governor. Many of his reforms are what the rest of Europe based their institutions on, only much later.


**2. Napoleon was a lover, not a fighter.**

*In September 1805, Austria invaded Napoleon’s ally Bavaria, and Russia declared war on France as well. Napoleon swiftly won the ensuing War of the Third Coalition with his finest victory, at Austerlitz in 1805. The next year the Prussians also declared war on him, but they were soundly defeated at Jena; Napoleon’s peace treaty of Tilsit with Russia and Prussia followed. The Austrians declared war on France once more in 1809, but were dispatched at the Battle of Wagram and signed yet another peace treaty.

Napoleon started none of those wars, but he won all of them. After 1809 there was an uneasy peace with the three other Continental powers, but in 1812 he responded to France’s being cut out of Russian markets—in violation of the Tilsit terms—by invading Russia. That ended in the catastrophic retreat from Moscow, which cost him more than half a million casualties and left his Grande Armée too vitiated to deter Austria and Prussia from joining his enemies Russia and Britain in 1813.*

Bar the Russian Invasion mistake (and I will concede that it was a hell of a mistake), Napoleon did not display the characteristics of a warmonger. Upon his return from exile, his charisma as a leader ensured he reclaimed the throne without shedding a drop of blood, as each army sent to fight him joined him immediately. 

When he was condemned by the allies in the Vienna Declaration, he wrote to them - “After presenting the spectacle of great campaigns to the world, from now on it will be more pleasant to know no other rivalry than that of the benefits of peace, of no other struggle than the holy conflict of the happiness of peoples.”

You can argue that it was just posturing, but there is no precedent to suggest it was not genuine.

*He told his council that he had renounced any dream of reconstituting the empire and that “henceforth the happiness and the consolidation” of France “shall be the object of all my thoughts.” He refrained from taking measures against anyone who had betrayed him the previous year. “Of all that individuals have done, written or said since the taking of Paris,” he proclaimed, “I shall forever remain ignorant.” He immediately set about instituting a new liberal constitution incorporating trial by jury, freedom of speech and a bicameral legislature that curtailed some of his own powers; it was written by the former opposition politician Benjamin Constant, whom he had once sent into internal exile.*

He immediately set about refunding the art galleries and public buildings of Paris, in the 12 weeks before the war would begin.

**3. Liberalism in the rest of Europe would have thrived.**

*If Napoleon had remained emperor of France for the six years remaining in his natural life, European civilization would have benefited inestimably. The reactionary Holy Alliance of Russia, Prussia and Austria would not have been able to crush liberal constitutionalist movements in Spain, Greece, Eastern Europe and elsewhere; pressure to join France in abolishing slavery in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean would have grown; the benefits of meritocracy over feudalism would have had time to become more widely appreciated; Jews would not have been forced back into their ghettos in the Papal States and made to wear the yellow star again; encouragement of the arts and sciences would have been better understood and copied; and the plans to rebuild Paris would have been implemented, making it the most gorgeous city in the world.*




TL;DR - Napoleon was an all round great dude, and great leader who accomplished so much in such little time. If he had stayed in power for the 6 more years until his death, France and Europe would have benefitted greatly from it.

There was another massive Russian/Austrian army on the way to join the British and the Prussians. Almost all of Europe was fairly united in their opposition to Napoleon and you cannot wage war against an entire continent, no matter how good of a general you are. Add the fact that many of the reasons that were behind Napoleon's earlier successes were no longer present - the allies had reformed their armies, were coordinating their operations better, and learned from their previous mistakes. France, on the other hand, was drained of its manpower and was economically exhausted. In short, Napoleon's chances of rebuilding his empire were very slim. At best, he would be embroiled in continuous game of wack-a-mole where one part or another rebelled. It would be an unending war with hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of casualties. 

That aside, the article is extremely generous to Napoleon, more than he deserves. Napoleon crowned himself Emperor - hardly a republican thing to do. He invaded countries or threatened them  with invasion to make them comply with his demands. He installed his family members and close associates as kings and dukes of conquered territories. He forced conquered peoples to pay him taxes to fund his next campaigns and enforced the continental blockade against their will. 

You can't really frame the Napoleonic wars as ones of republicanism  vs monarchism. Britain was a constitutional monarchy and was staunchly against Napoleon. In Spain, Napoleon faced a national uprising against his rule (or rather Napoleon's brother whom he tried to install as king).  

Saying that Napoleon wanted peace in 1805 or 1809 is a bit disingenuous. Saddam Hussein also wanted peace after conquering Kuwait. Does that make the United States and the UN forced that launched Operation Desert Storm in 1991 the aggressors? Hitler didn't want war with Great Britain and France after he invaded Poland in 1939. They declared war on Germany - are they the aggressors? Why should we take 1805 or 1809 as the baseline? You have to consider the context.","Not disagreeing but wanting to add a few things. 

1) Napoleon's heirs shared none of his genius if anything they weren't that bright (the final Napoleon ended up being killed by the Zulu)

2) Russia was not necessarily a mistake in of itself. Napoleon's mistake at Russia (besides his lack of tactics in a big battle that led to many french men dying needlessly) was not turning around from Moscow as soon as he burned it. He ended up staying for another month in Moscow

3) even if he won Waterloo he would have still faced opposition from the British who would have pounced after he died and stirred dissent",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more persuasive and likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides a more detailed and critical analysis of Napoleon's actions and the geopolitical situation during his reign.

Additionally, Reply A addresses the flaws in the original post's argument, such as Napoleon's self-crowning as Emperor and his aggressive tactics in conquering other territories.

On the other hand, while Reply B adds some valuable points about Napoleon's heirs and his mistakes in the Russian campaign, it does not provide as strong of a counterargument to the original post's claims.

Therefore, Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view due to its comprehensive analysis and critical examination of Napoleon's reign."
predict-explain,"* As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.  
* Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic.
* Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. 
* I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the ""warm glow"" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. 
* Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture. Because of climate change, and the overuse of farmlands we may reach that point in the near future.

So, ruling out the unlikely extremes, we can imagine that the vast majority of them would grow up to be ""regular"" or ""average"" people, correct? 

Average people grow, explore, discover, make friends, they create, they produce, they share, they connect, they bond, they feel and illicit feeling. They have families, they make families, they love and they are loved. Assuming you don't come from a family of exclusively ""geniuses, and great innovators"" or ""Unabombers and sociopaths"", presumably you are, and are surrounded by fairly average people.

You have to understand that when discussing matters of life and death, money is not the correct language. The value of human life cannot be measured in dollars. It is measured in emotion, love, connections, influence...

Have you never been impacted by another human being? How can you measure the impact and importance of a kind, positive person. That individual will walk through their life leaving positive impressions and effects all around them - like a wake behind a boat, rippling out and out, influencing the next person and the next, who then turns around and continues that outward spread. Have you never been effected by a warm smile, or a bit of small-talk?

Clearly, I disagree with the entire premise of your argument. I think it shows a profound lack of empathy, or better yet, any actual understanding of life and humanity. However, let's go on and debate this on your own terms. 

You say that the cost of caring for these sick kids isn't justified by the potential of their being great successes, simply because the odds of that happening are too slim. 

&gt;&gt;"" I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump.""

You are right that the odds are slim, however you are wrong to say that therefore ""the argument falls apart when we look at expected returns."" Let's use your Einstein example. How does one quantify the monetary worth of a great scientist? Let's imagine that we had never had the contributions of Watson &amp; Crick. Without the discovery and understanding of DNA, where would modern medicine stand today? Is caring for 100 thousand ""average"" sick kids worth the preservation of 1 Watson &amp; Crick equivalent? I would certainly say so. 

Let's look at a businessman like Steve Jobs. How much wealth did he create in his lifetime? How many billions and billions of dollars were generated in the development, production, distribution and sales of his products? You say, ""he's 1 in a million,"" right? Well, let's imagine he's generated 10 billion dollars of wealth in his lifetime (rather conservative). Him being 1 in a million means that we could spend 1,000 dollars on each and every one of the other 999,000 individuals and we'd only just then reach his worth. Moreover, that's assuming that the other 999,000 people contributed *absolutely zero value over their entire lives*. 

The other problem with your argument is that you seem to believe that great people exist in vacuums. Perhaps the sick kid you save is our next great scientist's little cousin. Perhaps his or her little cousin's perseverance, strength, or tragic death, has motivated and inspired our future scientist to do great things. Perhaps this sick child lives long enough to make friends in school. Perhaps he or she loves science fiction books and movies, and that interest rubs off on one of his/her friends who otherwise wouldn't have picked up this interest at such a young age. Perhaps that nascent interest in the wonders of science and its possibilities was *invaluable* in the formation of our next great scientist. 

The bottom line is, trying to place a dollar amount on the value of a human life is hopeless. We exist in infinitely complex social environments, and even ""average"" people can be instrumental in the generation of massive, valuable changes in the world. 

All that aside, we preserve the lives of ill children (or of any age), because someone loves them. They don't want to lose them. There is no dollar amount one can place on that.","All of your points are rooted in a broadly utilitarian philosophy, which holds that whichever action increases utility is the morally correct one to make - in the case of your argument, it is mainly economic utility. It fails to take into account a number of things. Firstly, there is another definition of 'utility' - the maximisation of pleasure. Letting sick children die is an exercise in cold pragmatism, and not an action (or consequence of deliberate inaction, more specifically) that anyone would relish or enjoy. There is undeniable value in allowing and encouraging a society to feel good about itself, and failure to take that into account would result in a society that has less esteem in itself, and therefore a society that functions less efficiently, and is more likely to descend into dysfunction. Indeed, Jeremy Bentham, considered the founder of modern utilitarianism, said that, ""it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong"". And while your suggestions would probably provide a small economic boost, this does not make up for the inevitable loss of happiness that such actions would cause.

To look outside of utilitarian philosophy, I would also hold that your suggestion runs contrary to the entire point of government, which is look after its citizens, to safeguard their lives and livelihoods. A government should - and most, thankfully, do, to at least some extent - look after the needs of its most vulnerable citizens, *regardless of whether or not this is of any economic benefit*. Taking a ruthlessly pragmatic approach to the lives and well-being of the citizens in their care is not the mark of a functional government trying to foster a stable society, but of a government trying to trim society down to its bare, self-sustainable bones - in other words, not a government trying to its best for the people, but a government trying to make itself obsolete in one of the most brutal ways possible. 

As for your Malthusian argument, I think the number of sick children being kept alive in the ways you describe is low enough to have a negligible effect on the total human population.",A,A,"I would say that reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A effectively challenges the original poster's utilitarian argument by emphasizing the intrinsic value of human life beyond economic considerations. It highlights the impact that even ""average"" individuals can have on the world and the interconnectedness of society. It also brings up the emotional aspect of caring for sick children and the importance of empathy and compassion in decision-making.

On the other hand, reply B also makes valid points about the importance of societal happiness and the role of government in safeguarding its citizens. However, it does not address the original poster's arguments as directly or comprehensively as reply A does. It focuses more on the broader philosophical implications of the original poster's stance rather than directly challenging the specific points made.

Overall, reply A provides a more thorough and emotionally compelling argument that is likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially lead to a change in their viewpoint."
predict-explain,"I'm no professional when it comes to logic or argumentation but I have been pondering this thought lately.  I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural.  If after death we experience what we experienced before birth which is nothingness, then isnt life meaningless?  Why should we continue to suffer when life is literally a constant suffering?  I personally believe life is meaningless.  When you are under the assumption that you experience nothingness when you are dead, what is the point of living?  
The only reason I can personally see for living is to not inflict additional emotional suffering on those that you know and care about you.  But if you do experience nothingness after life then why should it matter when you wont be able to conceive of this suffering.
Its been something I've been thinking a lot about lately... Change my view, please.
Also, this is not a cry for help and I will not be jumping off the golden gate bridge any time soon.","I would dispute the notion that life is a constant suffering. Surely you don't live every single moment of your day in suffering. The human mind is not that powerful. If we didn't occasionally become distracted from any suffering that we do face in our lives, then we wouldn't be able to function properly. The vast majority of all people experience fleeting moments of happiness.


Additionally, the nature of suffering is something which many philosophers have attempted to understand. I'm partial to the Buddhist interpretation, which is that suffering is caused by unfulfilled desires and distractions from the reality of our lives. A seemingly well-off person who revels in fantasy all day long may be considerably more unhappy than a poor person who spends time trying to enjoy the life they actually live. To want something and not have it is often a cause of suffering. A common counter-point to this may be that perhaps someone is in poor health and experiences physical pain as a result. Excluding only the most extreme examples where pain simply cannot be managed, what is the suffering truly caused by? Most likely the bitterness at lacking in physical comfort or ability. However, one who embraces the reality of their health and works to maximize happiness within their limitations can still be a very happy person who does not always suffer. I think Stephen Hawking is a great example of a person with extreme physical disability, and yet he has lived a life that by many objective measures is considerably more fulfilling than the average person's.


Now we must consider suicide as a mechanism for rectifying the problem of meaning. Suicide is just about the only way that you can completely remove all possibility of meaning and happiness from your life. Therefore, I would consider the premise that suicide is a solution to this problem a complete contradiction. The fact that you haven't killed yourself seems to suggest that you may recognize this on some level.","The presence of present suffering does not equal future suffering.

**Be happy.** The complicated part is how to achieve this.
The first thing one must do, is to figure out why they are here. In the grand scheme of things, what does their life mean? One needs to find some type of spirituality. For those who believe in a deity it may not be as difficult, but for those who do not, a void is often left. The first place to start for an atheist is to recognize the sheer improbability of one’s own consciousness. The fact that billions of years ago energy condensed into matter, this matter consolidated to form giant space rocks, these rocks flew past each other altering each other’s trajectory through space, one just happened to settle next to an appropriate size star and at the appropriate distance, amino acids on this rock came together in the perfect conditions, created life, life evolved, and you became you.

Not only is it amazing that you are here. The fact that you know you are here is amazing. I think therefore I am. (I refine Descartes’ statement as, “I am aware, therefore I am.”) Knowing how all this happened, and realizing the time scale, one can start to appreciate the gift of the short time of consciousness we are all given by the cosmos. We only have a short time in existence so it is important to attain this happiness while we are here, this appreciation of our consciousness is the first step.
Many people subconsciously know they want happiness, but are confused as to how to get there. I find it unsettling when I hear people worry about growing up to be a janitor or some other career that is unjustly looked down upon by society. Don’t get me wrong, a person needs money to be happy, but the only reason they need it is to fulfill Maslow’s basic needs. All other acquirements are superfluous. What people don’t study enough is what creates happiness, they only study what creates money.

What we must realize is that we are the human animal. When is a dog at its happiest? Is it happy when it is in a cage, cooped up, with no stimulation? Or is it happiest when it is running around, playing fetch? A dog is happiest when it is being a dog and doing dog things. The same goes for humans. Humans are happiest when they are actualizing their human nature. When we notice the presence of mirror neurons, and the negative feelings that arise in ourselves when we hurt someone, and notice the positive feelings that arise when we help someone, we can start to understand our true nature. Often when people come home from war, after having killed, after destroying other consciousness’s, they become suicidal or depressed. Conversely, new mothers and fathers often describe the day their child was born, the day they created consciousness, as “the happiest day of my life.” These are actions humans take that are at two ends of a spectrum, with many other actions that affect other people in between. Insulting someone and complimenting someone are also two opposite actions on this spectrum. When I ask myself why I want to have children I cannot come up with an obvious rational answer, but when I notice that procreating is ingrained in the human species and life itself, the answer becomes clear. I want to have children because I am human, and that’s what humans do. Humans become happy when they are moral beings because it is especially in our nature. We are more conscious than most species because of our social nature. Our higher level thinking has arisen, through evolution, specifically as a result of our need to navigate social intricacies. We are fundamentally connected with each other and when we act like it we reap personal internal rewards.",B,A,"I would say that Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides a more detailed and nuanced exploration of the concept of suffering and meaning in life, drawing on philosophical perspectives and real-life examples to illustrate the potential for happiness and fulfillment even in the face of challenges. The user also challenges the idea that life is inherently meaningless and presents a compelling argument against suicide as a solution to the perceived lack of meaning. On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the importance of finding happiness and purpose in life, but does not delve as deeply into the philosophical aspects of suffering and meaning. Overall, Reply A offers a more comprehensive and thought-provoking response that may prompt the original poster to reconsider their perspective."
predict-explain,"It's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. However, to make a group, each member has to have something in common, other than just being human. It could be gender, race, a common vision or belief. You get the idea.

So by uniting based on common characteristics, we automatically exclude those who don't fit the mould. Thus creating every kind of discrimination you can think of.

The worst part is, if you look at groups of people looking to reduce discrimination, they're as much as part of the problem as the original perpetrators. One example of this in action is the reporter who was kicked out of a Black Lives event in CSU. African Americans have a long history of mistreatment in the US and many have the right to be furious. But the problem is that they see all ""whites"" as being the perpetrators of this mistreatment and exacerbate the ""white vs black"" dichotomy. 

My opinion on how to solve these issues is this: I've been told that to solve problems as a couple, you mustn't make it ""you"" vs ""partner"", you have to make it ""both of you as a couple"" vs ""the problem"". So I think we should apply the same logic to racism and sexism. Women vs men and whites vs blacks (only two of the uncountable amount of dichotomies that exist) can't be solved by separating and pointing fingers at the other group, it can only be solved by uniting. There is no Us vs Them, only Us.

Perhaps you've suffered discrimination first hand (as I have) and disagree with my opinion because you want justice above all. In which case, please explain your opinion.

Edit: Sorry if I reply late, having a bit of a family emergency.","&gt; Women vs men and whites vs blacks (only two of the uncountable amount of dichotomies that exist) can't be solved by separating and pointing fingers at the other group, it can only be solved by uniting.

This sounds great on the surface, but fails horribly in practice. Most racism and sexism happens subconsciously. A white man is going to want to hire other white men. It's not that he's racist; it's just that we like people that are like us. Unless you point out this behavior and make him conscious of it, it will continue on forever.

Likewise, a police department may arrest black people at a higher proportion than white people. It's not that they are racist, but the arrest records show that black people are more likely to be criminals; a connection is made in your mind. Making it a visible topic, you get the chance to consider whether black people really *are* more likely to be criminals, or if it is a self-perpetuating bias.","I think you're overlooking the fact that most of the progress that we've made so far (racism, sexism, etc.) has been because members of both groups have united against the problem. For example, when women finally achieved the right to vote it wasn't simply because all women wanted to vote, while all men didn't want this; members of both groups united and tackled the problem.

But there's always blowback because not everyone wants to join, not everyone is as progressive as you think they are. Your view is (slightly) naive because it doesn't take into account that there are those people who accept (an out of balance) status quo and are willing to defend it. A simple example on Reddit is TRP. Feminists welcome men and women to work for the equality of women, but this doesn't go down too well with everyone so there are counter-movements. TRP is an example of a lot of stupid people who aren't comfortable with change because they don't understand it or because they feel that it's going too far.",B,B,"I believe reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides specific examples and explanations of how subconscious biases contribute to discrimination, and emphasizes the importance of making individuals conscious of their behavior in order to address and challenge these biases.

In contrast, reply B focuses more on the progress that has been made through unity but does not delve as deeply into the underlying factors contributing to discrimination."
predict-explain,"One of the major policy appeals behind affirmative action is the creation of a diverse environment. A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse one. Universities have done an excellent job in creating an environment that has tons of racial, sexual, ethnic and religious diversity. However, it still lacks intellectual and political diversity. People with conservative or right-wing views are [woefully unrepresented](http://www.criticalreview.com/crf/pdfs/klein_stern.pdf) in academia, particularly in the social sciences.

Low numbers of right-leaning students and faculty at universities is but a symptom of a far larger problem; Politicism or political discrimination. This is a problem that won't be solved by affirmative action because there are other disincentives for right-leaning people to express their views anywhere.

**Part 1: Politicism outside university**

Our recent general election, and the surprise Conservative victory, lead to an outpouring of hatred and discrimination directed at the Prime Minister, MPs and voters who 'voted wrong'. Not even one day had passed before it descended into violence in the streets of the capital.

[Example 7](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GF87c9Ui_UM/VU5HL7BienI/AAAAAAAAAB8/5EXMiIh5m5Q/s400/Angry%2B6.PNG)

There is a certain level of ""anti-right"" culture emerging in the West whereby the left believes that, because the right are so vile and evil, any level of silencing or hatred directed at the right is justified. Needless to say, the only place I really speak my mind on the subject of politics is anonymously online or with close family. A lot of other people have the same attitude. While I was initially hesitant to call this ""censorship"", based upon the left-wing concept of ""No Platform"" I do now genuinely believe this is censorship, in many cases deliberately done.

**Part 2: The Student Union**

In the UK, students are theortetically represented by the Student Union. At the national level, it is called the NUS (although not all student unions are affiliated with the NUS). This organization is so left-wing that even Maoists would call them loons. 

The NUS, not Universities themselves, [is the primary source of on-campus censorship in the UK.](http://www.spiked-online.com/free-speech-university-rankings/analysis#.VYd03PlVhBc) Pro-life groups are banned at 4 universities. Right-leaning newspaper ""The Sun"" is banned at 26 theoretically for having nude models on Page 3, yet effectively identical content is still available in other publications making the actual motive of censoring right-wing content completely transparent. 

The NUS even supports Boycott, Diverstment and Sanctions for Israel. The level of intimidation this can cause for Israeli students attending university in the UK is obvious.

At the NUS Women's conference 2015, proposals were put forward to replace clapping with jazz hands because of concerns that clapping would cause anxiety attacks. Additionally, gay men were accused of appropriating black female culture and a proposal was put forward to ban crossdressing.

Bahar Mustafa, a ""Welfare and Diversity officer"" that works for a student union, has even gotten away with [banning white people from an anti-racism event.](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/04/white-people-have-now-been-banned-from-an-anti-racism-event-at-a-british-university/)

The NUS uses it's power to censor it's political opponents, to intimidate right-leaning students and enforce it's narrative upon new students. It completely fails to represent students, yet at the national level there is no competitor to the NUS.

**Part 3: Lecturers and other university incidents**

[Read this blog post in its entirety.](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/05/if-youre-a-conservative-im-not-your-friend/)

If you were a conservative voter studying philosophy at Royal Holloway, there is massive incentive for you to hide your views because of the hateful political attitudes of one of the faculty. No doubt similar hateful attitudes are held silently by even more faculty. This isn't even a personal blog; it's an academic one.

It's so bad that I hide my political beliefs at my own university, and I would describe myself as a Centrist, not right-leaning.

There have been multiple incidents at British universities where Israeli students or speakers have faced intimidation. [Here's just one of them.](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/21/george-galloway-debate-israeli-oxford)

**Part 4: Why affirmative action is insufficient**

Affirmative action is supposed to be a last resort effort to increase inclusion after anti-discrimination measures have been tried. Unfortunately, there has been zero attempt to prevent political discrimination at university. If anything, it seems actively encouraged. Until that encouragement is ended and regular support avenues for non-left students are set up affirmative action will do nothing.

My personal recommendations for the UK:

* At a national level, set up a competitor to the NUS. There are a handful of student unions that have chosen to separate from the NUS due to it's radicalism that could work together to form this. It would be politically neutral.

* Prevent the NUS from enforcing censorship policies.

* Fire faculty and reprimand students who partake in or encourage discrimination towards anyone who is right-leaning.

* Crackdown on the currently legitimized and even supported Anti-Semetic and Anti-Israeli policies enacted at universities.

* Create a system by which students can report politicism, preferably at a level above universities instead of at the university itself because of the likelihood that such a system would be co-opted to deny right-leaning students access to it.

* Ensure that progenitors of Conservative ideology, such as Edmund Burke, are studied alongside the progenitors of Socialist ideology where relevant even prior to University level.

* Remove communist agitprop (such as ""An Inspector Calls"") from the English Literature GCSE.

If, after enacting all these policies and waiting 20 years, there is still a severe leftist slant in UK academia, then Affirmative Action would be worth considering as a last resort.","It's not just the Social Sciences that are dominated by the Left. The majority of *all* sciences skew towards the left rather than the right. 

I mean, the decision to be an academic has many qualities that appeal more to a Liberal than a Conservative.

1. For example, why would a highly educated and talented scientist rather work as a researcher post-doc with dismal pay, rather than find a high-paying industry job? Because he is less motivated by the size of the salary but more-so by the perceived value of the work he does. Certain kinds of people would rather do poorly paid University Research. Republicans are obsessed with minimizing taxes to maximize your personal income. Is it surprising that Republicans elect to take a higher paying industry job rather than stay in lower-paying academia? 


2. Moreover, graduate schools are dominated by foreign-born students coming to America as a pathway to citizenship. At my state university, the vast majority of grad-students were foreigners, and the faculty was too. Is it particularly surprising that a multicultural faculty is hostile towards US White Conservatism? Perhaps then the very reason why Academia is Left-dominated is precisely because of *diversity*. Of course professors will be angry at pro-white, anti-multiculturalist rants, when their demographics are much more multicultural than the larger US population!

As far as you know, most faculties may already have ideologically-based affirmative action programs in place. American universities are obviously not structurally homogeneous. Unfortunately, the talent pool of willing applicants may be so small that finding a qualified Conservative is nearly impossible. Just look at the stereotype of a Liberal arts graduate student! Do you really suppose a mainstream Conservative man will spend 5 years of his life on a PhD history thesis without salary? Will the typical Conservative stereotype elect to study the social sciences?


Finally, let's not forget the irony that affirmative-action-for-Republicans would fly against the face of Republican politics and ideology. Universities hire academics that can produce lots and lots of viable papers. Publish or perish. Moreover, Universities such as Harvard are private institutions that ""ought to"" do whatever the fuck they want. According to Republican political positions, ideologically-based affirmative action ought not be allowed. Positions should be given solely on merit - or in the Academic's case - their ability to generate vast amounts of research papers and bring prestige to the University. Conservatives should not be allowed into academia for the exact reason why Blacks or Latinos or other affirmative action'ed classes should not be allowed in - because they simply could not compete and do not have the necessary merit to be chosen.

Conservative professors should not be coddled by affirmative action, or they shall grow lazy and incompetent!",A,A,"Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view.

predict-explain,"I agree with most of Bernie's domestic politics, but foreign policy is a critical aspect of the presidency and I don't think he has what it takes. To convince me otherwise (and thus support Bernie), you'll need to show me I'm wrong about the following points, or that they don't matter:

1) I've never seen him not looking generally flustered and awkward. Working on international issues requires developing personal relationships, thus being good at making friends. I don't think he is like that.

2) It requires building alliance and persuading people. Bernie is an independent, does not have serious alliances or close friends in Congress despite being there for over two decades. He has not gotten any notable legislation passed. Would he really negotiate the best possible international treaties for the US?

3) A President needs to be able to understand and navigate everyone's goals. Bernie doesn't seem to try to understand everyone's motivations but rather just gets angry at people who think differently from him. e.g. he says things like ""I'll never understand why some poor people vote republican""

4) Being a leader involves standing up to or effectively dealing with bullies and thinking quickly. He has very little track record of doing this. And when the BLM protesters took his mic at his own rally, he just passively let it happen, seemed a bit bewildered. It may have been a reasonable decision to let them speak, but he clearly wasn't in control of the situation. How could he stand up to Putin, Khamenei, etc.?


Edit: Thanks for all of the info, I haven't 100% changed my mind but I was clearly wrong about a number of things as the links you provided show:

He does have bipartisan congressional achievements:

He does make friends with people who disagree with him:

which includes this statement from Chuck Schumer: ""He knew when to hold and knew when to fold and, I think, maximized what we could get for veterans,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, who also participated in the VA talks.

He can be quite assertive in a non-blustery way:

And, though it wasn't exactly contradicting my previous view, he does have a better knowledge of foreign policy nuance than I thought:

Working on international issues requires developing personal relationships, thus being good at making friends. I don't think he is like that.

Did you know that Jim Inhofe, the ultraconservative man who thinks that climate change is a hoax(also wrote a ton of books on this) regards Bernie, the man who was the #1 ranked Senator for fighting climate change by various organizations as his best friend in the Senate?

&gt;2) It requires building alliance and persuading people. Bernie is an independent, does not have serious alliances or close friends in Congress despite being there for over two decades. He has not gotten any notable legislation passed. Would he really negotiate the best possible international treaties for the US?

This is dead wrong. As a House member, he got the most amendments passed as anyone in the Congress. In the Senate he worked with Congressman Ron Paul to audit the Fed. He got a 10 billion dollar provision to increase the number of people community health centers served by 10 million. He worked with John McCain recently to craft the new Veterans Affairs Budget which was one of the most significant pieces of bipartisan legislation negotiated in a dysfunctional Congress. If you look into his history, it's pretty obvious that he did way more than Hillary Clinton(or any other candidate) ever did. 

&gt;3) A President needs to be able to understand and navigate everyone's goals. Bernie doesn't seem to try to understand everyone's motivations but rather just gets angry at people who think differently from him. e.g. he says things like ""I'll never understand why some poor people vote republican""

Of course it doesn't make sense why poor people vote Republican. Every survey shows that people tend to lean towards more liberal positions. Can you tell me why poor people vote against their interests?

&gt;4) Being a leader involves standing up to or effectively dealing with bullies and thinking quickly. He has very little track record of doing this. And when the BLM protesters took his mic at his own rally, he just passively let it happen, seemed a bit bewildered. It may have been a reasonable decision to let them speak, but he clearly wasn't in control of the situation. How could he stand up to Putin, Khamenei, etc.?

I already pointed out how he dealt with John McCain and Ron Paul among others. I thought that his reaction to BLM was the best choice he could do at that time. If he took back the mic, he would've gotten tons of bad press for not allowing black people to speak. How does this have anything to do with Putin? When hypothetical President Sanders deals with Putin, he isn't going to do so on a stage with thousands of people in front of him.","Hey buddy. This is something i asked myself too and Mr. Sanders has passed my test. Here Ill try and explain why.

&gt;1) I've never seen him not looking generally flustered and awkward. Working on international issues requires developing personal relationships, thus being good at making friends. I don't think he is like that.

This is pretty subjective. How do you mean flustered? He speaks with his hands (he's from Brooklyn), his hair is messy, but please elaborate on why you feel this way because i disagree that he looks flustered or awkward. Hes actual a pretty good orator IMO.

&gt;2) It requires building alliance and persuading people. Bernie is an independent, does not have serious alliances or close friends in Congress despite being there for over two decades. He has not gotten any notable legislation passed. Would he really negotiate the best possible international treaties for the US?

As a (I) senator, he doesn't have the ""party"" alliances a straightforward Dem or Rep would have because hes the *only* Ind in our federal legislative body. As Dem president, this would change as he'd have the entire Dem aisle. That, in conjunction with hes been in Senate and USHOR for 20+ years so he has friends and has worked on bills with other representatives. That, and as president, his negotiations would take on a whole new level of seriousness when dealing internationally. This is a sticky issue for any pres candidate as there's really no ""well ive done this so i can deal internationally"" for them to say (unless they're an former/incumbent POTUS). 

&gt;3) A President needs to be able to understand and navigate everyone's goals. Bernie doesn't seem to try to understand everyone's motivations but rather just gets angry at people who think differently from him. e.g. he says things like ""I'll never understand why some poor people vote republican""

How is that any different then other reps? John Beohner swore to block anything and everything that Obama would try and pass. Strictly from a ""I dont like you"" POV. This is bullshit and he needs to be removed for this  (and other things). Were working on that (I live in Ohio). But regardless, to him, seeing the bush tax cuts and how the republicans love the system that is keeping poor people poor (Trickle Down, cutting social security/ social services, NAFTA/ various other trade deals) its a alright question. 

&gt;4) Being a leader involves standing up to or effectively dealing with bullies and thinking quickly. He has very little track record of doing this. And when the BLM protesters took his mic at his own rally, he just passively let it happen, seemed a bit bewildered. It may have been a reasonable decision to let them speak, but he clearly wasn't in control of the situation. How could he stand up to Putin, Khamenei, etc.? 

This wasn't **his** event. It was a rally on Social Security, medicare that he was invited to speak at. If you watch the video, you'll see a guy (not Bernie) at the podium talking to the BLM girls. *That* guy was the organizer and Bernie said to him to let them speak. Its not about being a pushover, Its about, if i stop them, i look bad, i if i let them speak, ill look better and considering how he himself was arrested for nonviolent civil disobedience, it would be a little hypocritical for him to stop them. A 20 year old B.S. would probably sympathize with these girls and a 73 year old B.S. is still a civil rights sympathizer. 


**edit Spelling, grammar

Edit#2 Here he is on ""State of the Union"" speaking about [ISIS](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/video-audio/sanders-on-cnns-state-of-the-union)",A,B,"I believe Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply A provides specific examples and evidence to counter each of the original poster's points, demonstrating Bernie Sanders' ability to build alliances, negotiate bipartisan legislation, and handle difficult situations. The user also addresses the concerns raised by the original poster in a clear and logical manner, providing a more convincing argument overall."
predict-explain,"I often see any talk about rape go hand in hand with two sides: people advocating increased safety of all people, and people defending victims of rape by saying that information triggers victims, and therefore the information ends up at ends. This includes language such as ""Pepper spray can deter attackers of any kind, and therefore it is strongly recommended that ANYBODY carries it with them at all times."" or ""Hot zones for crime include times after dusk and before dawn, so it is advised to travel in groups at this time to deter attackers.""

People rage at this information saying that I should not ask anything of the victim, and that this information is useless. People often use the argument ""We should teach people NOT TO RAPE""

My issue here is that the suppression of this information in lieu of pursuing an idealistic rape-free culture neglects the current standing of our surroundings, and that dangerous people still exist, and will exist for the foreseeable future. I see no harm in telling anyone that safety is important, and that there are very cogent steps to significantly lower your risk of being attacked and/or raped.

The only instance I would excuse my previous statement would be people telling actual victims of rape what they COULD have done. This does nothing to change what happened, and is a slimey thing to do.

Maybe this is just an Anti-SJW rant that I didn't even know I was making, or maybe I have an actual argument here. If I am not clear on this classic argument, I would appreciate some clarity, and am always open to thoughtful and courteous discussion.

Please no flaming, arguing, or fighting. Thank you!

What i see is that while for men sex is a *need*, like hunger and all (a need that doesn't kill us but instead makes us suffer if unsatisfied), for women it's more of a take-it-or-leave-it thing, something they can enjoy but that they don't really need, a nice thing to have but that doesn't really matter much if they don't have it, like, say, chocolate (although women would be far less willing to give up chocolate in my experience).

There's a ridiculous amount of generalization in your post and none of it is particularly true. 

First of all, no one NEEDS sex. Sex is a desire. It is part of a biological system designed to  propagate the species, of course, but it's a desire based system. You will not die without it. You NEED oxygen. You NEED water. You do not NEED sex. You want it. You'd survive just fine without it. 

Sexual drive, libido, it's a very individual thing that varies from person to person even without the myriad varying factors, like hormones and medications and traumatic experiences, etc. You've apparently taken women's reaction to you, personally, to extend to all women and decided it's because we don't need/want sex as much as men. Which is nonsense. Most women, like most men, enjoy sex and desire it. If they don't particularly seem to want sex with you (and I'm saying IF, not assuming...just guessing based on this post and your responses), that doesn't mean they don't want or enjoy sex at all.","This is a huge generalization of both men and women. For some people, sex is a take it or leave it type of thing. For others, it is something more akin to a need.

I know plenty of women who are sex-positive and need to have sex in order to feel fulfilled and satisfied in their relationships. I know men who don't need to have sex on some kind of regular basis.

I think this perception of yours stems mostly from societal expectations of both men and women. Men are raised to feel like they should see sex as some kind of insatiable hunger (boys being boys). Where as women are raised to view sex as something damaging to them and that they should strive to save for their one true love (see: the idea that vaginas can be stretched out by too much sex to uselessness).",B,A,"I would say reply B is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. Reply B provides a more nuanced and balanced perspective on the topic, acknowledging that both men and women can have varying attitudes towards sex. It also brings up the influence of societal expectations and norms on how men and women perceive and approach sex, which adds depth to the discussion.

In contrast, reply A comes off as more confrontational and dismissive of the original poster's beliefs. While it does provide some valid points about the nature of sex as a desire rather than a need, it lacks the empathy and understanding that reply B demonstrates. Reply B's acknowledgment of individual differences and societal influences is more likely to encourage the original poster to reconsider their views on the topic."
predict-explain,"The reasoning behind this view is that everyone is entitled to human companionship, and that these guys are frustrated/critical of flaws they see in our current cultural mating patterns. Single guys suffering deserve as much respect and empathy as women who may face different challenges. Also, these guys are often being vulnerable to their crushes and trying to start a romantic relationship. Even if the other party isn't interested, it's brave of them and they shouldn't be mocked for their courage.

predict-explain,"Let me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with *most* SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions, but I actually think it does more to silence non-privileged voices than it does to encourage education, empowerment, progress, or harmony.

A college education (or at the very least, the Internet and plenty of time on one's hands) seems to be a standard cost of entry for dialogue with a typical SJW. Dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as: patriarchy, heteronormativity, trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF), cisgendered, gender spectrum, gentrification, respectability politics, privilege, oppression, identity, assimilation, queer, otherkin, institutionalization, marginalization, etc....I could keep going.

These are all terms that I've just pulled directly from SJW Tumblr pages/comments. Some are more easily defined than others, but there are still layers to each concept (such as privilege or oppression) that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time they've been exposed to these ideas.

Honestly, I have a master's, and the first time this language was thrown my way, I felt dumb for not understanding some of it. How might someone who could only afford a high school education feel? I get that they want to use intelligent, specific language to explain some concepts that are difficult to put into words, but how is someone who doesn't have the privilege of a college education, or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts, expected to engage in dialogue that sounds like it's spoken by a women's studies textbook? It can be intimidating, and no one likes to have a conversation that makes them feel stupid. How is this use of privileged language encouraging those who are economically and educationally marginalized to participate?

I don't want to generalize, but from my own experience, a majority of SJWs enjoy doing what they do because they like winning arguments. It's not about empowering and educating. In the face of ignorance, SJWs tend to belittle and insult, rather than educate or allow for a balance dialogue. The attitude is, ""Oh, you're ignorant? Let me make you feel *more* ignorant by insulting you and using words you don't understand.""

Again, I'm in favor of most ideas SJWs tend to champion...transgender rights, #BlackLivesMatter, feminism, etc. I just think they're going about it in a way that turns people off, because they're so concerned with being able to flex their knowledge and with shutting down those who might disagree with their ideas the tiniest bit.

There is no ""SJW movement."" It's just a pejorative label. There is no group that self-identifies as SJWs. There is no ""SJW"" organization. No SJW leaders. No SJW conferences.  

What you view as a movement is just a bunch of independent people with similar conceptions of social justice, and they may have different views on politics, economics, etc.  

&gt;A college education (or at the very least, the Internet and plenty of time on one's hands) seems to be a standard cost of entry for dialogue with a typical SJW. Dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as: patriarchy, heteronormativity, trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF), cisgendered, gender spectrum, gentrification, respectability politics, privilege, oppression, identity, assimilation, queer, otherkin, institutionalization, marginalization, etc....I could keep going.  

So...what, they shouldn't use any terms to describe certain societal phenomenons?  

Cis and trans are not hard concepts to learn, in fact they're being talked about all the time on the news thanks to people like Caitlyn Jenner. Gender spectrum isn't hard to figure out either. Spectrum is a pretty easy word. Combine that with gender, and it means exactly what it says on the tin!  

Gentrification isn't a ""SJW"" term, it's a term coined by sociologists to describe a very specific phenomenon. People who are affected by it know exactly what it is, even if they don't have a specific term to describe it. Giving it a name just makes it easier to communicate.  

Privilege is pretty easy to define. So is oppression. And identity. And assimilation. These four mean the same as their colloquial definition. Queer is something new, but it's strongly associated with gay rights so its not hard to introduce people to that term.  

Otherkin isn't something people are actually pushing for, where are you getting that from? What movement and mainstream figures are pushing for otherkin rights? None, but mentioning this term is how I can tell your view is colored too heavily by what you see and hear about ""SJWs"" on this site (I'm assuming from subreddits like /r/tumblrinaction and /r/adviceanimals).  

Institutional isn't hard either, it means exactly what it sounds like. Marginalized isn't an uncommon term either.  

**Note:** even if you don't agree that these terms accurately describe power dynamics in society, that doesn't mean the terms are bad

&gt;These are all terms that I've just pulled directly from SJW Tumblr pages/comments.  

Tumblr is just a blogging site with *more users* than reddit. A bunch of users on a social media site is not indicative of a social movement, especially if they don't even identify as such. Your view is skewed by what you see on reddit. They're a tiny, tiny, *tiny* fraction of users. They get attention because people like to go out and find stuff that offends them (ironically, just like the SJWs that are criticized!) and post it for cheap karma. Slap an outrageous quote on an image macro and you've got the attention of tens of thousands of users.

&gt;but there are still layers to each concept (such as privilege or oppression) that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time they've been exposed to these ideas  

Problem is, most people's first exposure to the idea is usually through pages dismissive of the concepts. I think that is a much bigger issue than the terms themselves. 

&gt;How might someone who could only afford a high school education feel?  

Tumblr's demographics skew pretty young, just like reddit. There's a lot of high schoolers on the site who do just fine.

&gt;or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts  

These aren't advanced-level sociological concepts. These are basic 101 terms, most of which, as I've described above, match pretty closely with their colloquial definitions. I think you're exaggerating how difficult these terms are.  

I'm not a sociologist nor have I taken any gender studies classes. Nowhere in college have I learned about these terms. If you were able to read about it on a blog, how high do you really think the barrier of entry is? Social media use is absolutely *huge* among youths today.

&gt;How is this use of privileged language encouraging those who are economically and educationally marginalized to participate?  

Because it gives them a name to what they're experiencing. Take for example, gentrification. A poor black family is forced out of their home due to rising rent costs because of yuppies moving in. What exactly is he supposed to call that? Do you have a better term in mind?   

&gt;I don't want to generalize, but from my own experience, a majority of SJWs enjoy doing what they do because they like winning arguments. It's not about empowering and educating. In the face of ignorance, SJWs tend to belittle and insult, rather than educate or allow for a balance dialogue.  

Your view of social activists seems entirely limited to what you've seen on places like reddit. Stop and realize that what you're viewing is intentionally cherry-picked to enrage its audience.","Before I get started, I want to point out the problem with using the term ""SJW"" (because this *will* bite you when it comes to the other comments) - it's a pejorative with a definition that's ambiguous at best, and almost no person to whom the term is applied identifies themselves by that term.  If there's going to be a meaningful discussion in further threads, you're going to need to clarify exactly what kind of ideology you're referring to, especially considering the recent trend of infighting within progressive factions (especially feminism) leading to many points of disagreement between individuals in these movements.

In regards to the terminology, the only thing about the ""SJW"" language that makes it difficult is that it's foreign to most people.  Many of these new or newly popularized terms can be defined for easy comprehension in a single sentence, or even less.  What is ""cisgendered""?  People that aren't transgender - done.  What is ""gentrification""?  Rich neighborhoods expanding into poor ones - done.  What is ""privilege""?  The idea that you can be better off by being born into money or being white - done.  Admittedly, many progressive folks make the mistake of using these terms without taking into account their audience, but it's a problem that is very easily remedied.  And clearly it doesn't take a college education to understand these things, because many of the people advocating for this stuff are still in secondary school.",A,B,"Reply B is more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply B addresses the issue of using the term ""SJW"" as a pejorative and emphasizes the importance of clarifying the ideology being referred to. Additionally, Reply B provides clear and concise explanations for some of the terminology used by those advocating for social justice causes, showing that these concepts are not as complex or inaccessible as the original poster may have perceived. By offering simple definitions for terms like ""cisgendered"" and ""privilege,"" Reply B effectively counters the argument that these concepts are too difficult for those with a high school education to understand. Overall, Reply B presents a more rational and logical argument that is likely to challenge the original poster's perspective."
predict-explain,"I've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small town/village, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too many to list, but the big ones are:

#Cities have significantly better municipal services.

The difference is night and day. Cities have bigger and better libraries, schools, police/fire departments, hospitals, gas, internet, and so on and so forth. As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first. Everything about this makes city life so much safer and more comfortable.

#Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.

A really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops. Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties. There are theatres and large public events and strip clubs and meetings of like-minded people and clubs and just about anything to do if you ever get bored. There's a convenience store on just about every corner.

#Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity.

If you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a **new neighbor** that they wanna get to know and everything. Even if you abstain from social interaction, you become ""that weird neighbor that abstains from social interaction."" This  tends to temper individualism, and it's not like you can ""just spend time with the people you like,"" because rumors and all travel fast with a community that small.

#bugs

holy fucking shit the bugs aaaaaaaaa

#In the country, everything is high maintenance.

Since just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.","&gt; If you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a new neighbor that they wanna get to know and everything. Even if you abstain from social interaction, you become ""that weird neighbor that abstains from social interaction."" 

This isn't necessarily something everyone finds nice about the city. Some people really enjoy moving into a small community and getting to know their neighbors, and some people feel isolated, small, and alone with the ""pseudo-anonymity"" that comes with living in an apartment complex in the middle of the city.  It really depends who's talking. For some, city life is better in this respect, but for others, it's not.

&gt; Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.

Depends what you're looking for. If all you want to do is go hiking on the weekends and tend your garden at home, the city won't be what you're looking for. The mountains would be a lot closer to the country, since they're *in* the country, and you'd be able to use your home space a lot better than if you had to walk ten blocks to a small patch of land cordoned off for a community garden (plus you'd have more space to grow).

&gt; bugs

&gt; holy fucking shit the bugs aaaaaaaaa

I trust you've never rented a cheap apartment in NYC? Cockroaches *everywhere*. No escape from the bugs in the city.

&gt; Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.

Source? Genuinely curious as to where you're getting this statistic, as I've never seen it before.

I guess in the end it really depends what you're looking for. For some, including you, city life is hugely preferable to country life. To others, there's nothing better than being able to live in central Massachusetts/middle-of-nowhere Wyoming/Appalachia. Really depends on the perspective you're coming from - what might be good for you isn't necessarily good for others.","I think there's a trade off for everything. You're accustomed to having everything as fast as you want it. Country people aren't. They know and accept some things are going to be a hike.

It's also possible you don't really ""hear"" the noise around you all the time like someone who hasn't grown up with it or lived in it for many years, would. Silence is golden, and if you live in an area where you can never have that, it can drive some people mad. 

It's difficult to say one is ""better"" than the other. I'd vouch both have their bonuses. 

The quiet, the privacy the country affords, the beauty of it. Enjoying nature, having a big garden, maybe even some farm animals. You can't do those things in the city and those things sure can keep people, very busy. 

The bugs one though, come on.

I do not buy into the whole argument of 'just because our parents brought us into the world, we owe them our lives.' Whether a child was brought into the world by choice or not, I don't think that being born should impose a debt of respect on the child. 

Furthermore, I think that this respect needs to be earned. I define respect in this context as 'regard for another person's rational ability, trusting that they can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out.'

This is why I think that giving the reason 'because I said so' is a total cop out. If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect. 

Don't get me wrong, I think it is crucial for a child to be told when they are wrong so that they don't grow up into narcissistic asshats. However, I think that they deserve a logical conversation with a parent until one side admits, of his own accord, that he is in the wrong.

Child children require a different form of respect, than adult children, in order to be respectful themselves. 
I respect my father for being a provider. He didn't leave my mom, though he was a teenager when he knocked her up. 
However, as an adult, and a parent; his ambivalence about me as a child, and his unreciprocated demands for respect in my adulthood, have the exact opposite effect. 
So, it is possible to respect someone as your parent, yet not respect them as a fellow adult.
Edited for clarity","When you are a child, you literally have no understanding of how the world works. You probably don't begin to understand life until your mid 20s. As a parent you are here to guide that child into becoming a successful and independent adult. Part of that process is learning who is superior in the parent-child relationship...

The parent is providing everything for the child. Clothes, shelter, food, knowledge, protection, time, and much more. You are completely dependent on this person. This absolutely commands respect. I would be damned if the child I sacrifice everything for does not respect me. 

Now I know each situation is unique and there are shit parents and great parents, but regardless your parent/guardian  is usually your go-to for anything in life. Whether it be ride to baseball practice  or some side cash or whatever. As long as you are dependent on them then you should at least respect them.",A,A,"I would say that Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view. 

Reply A provides a personal anecdote and acknowledges that respect can be given in different ways depending on the relationship dynamics. The user explains how they can respect their father for certain aspects, but not as a fellow adult due to their experiences. This nuanced perspective may help the original poster see that respect can be multifaceted and earned in different ways.

On the other hand, Reply B takes a more authoritarian stance on respect, emphasizing the parent's role as a provider and the child's dependency. While this argument may resonate with some, it does not address the original poster's points about the need for logical conversations and earning respect through rationality.

Overall, Reply A's personal experience and acknowledgment of different forms of respect make it more likely to resonate with the original poster and potentially change their view."
predict-explain,"Increasingly, many argue that elementary statistics should be a mandatory subject in the high school curriculum.  I agree with this wholeheartedly, as the discipline has become central to civic and economic literacy in the 21st century.  But to argue, as some have, that this should *replace* the traditional ""algebra to calculus"" high school math sequence makes about as much sense to me as arguing that history should replace English.  While the two undoubtedly share some skills and mechanics, they are fundamentally different disciplines with fundamentally different roles in the curriculum, and both are necessary for a complete education.


Although the underlying mechanics of statistics are undoubtedly mathematical, increasingly it is becoming recognized as a discipline in its own right, with its own methodology and best practices distinct from those of pure mathematics, and the structure of high school should reflect this divergence.  At the high school level, the focus of statistics pedagogy should be on core concepts, the appropriate use of technology, and interpretation-- you are teaching a student to turn data into an accurate, precise probablistic statement, and to have an intuitive understanding of the probability concepts underlying the meaning of that statement.  These are important skills, but they aren't really *mathematical* skills in the traditional sense; you are reasoning in a different mode.  


In a well-taught algebra, geometry, or calculus class, by contrast, students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively, learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence, solve non-routine problems, and use mathematics of all types to analyze real-world phenomena.  None of these skills except arguably the last play any role in an elementary statistics curriculum.  


You can argue that a deep facility with ""abstract"" math has little importance in the ""real world,"" but increasingly the 21st century economy *does* reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem-solving, even if you are never directly using specific skills (the classic ""when will I ever need the quadratic formula in real life"" bugbear).  Finally, learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields, which statistics training will not replace.  Thus, BOTH statistics and math, as separate disciplines, should have a role in the high school curriculum.


As a final note, I should mention that I am here presupposing that both statistics and pure math can are taught *well.*  Obviously, a well-taught statistics class is much more useful than a poorly-taught math class, and vice-versa.  I'm well aware that bad mathematics teaching (and bad statistics teaching, for that matter) is rampant in the U.S., so I'd prefer to keep the horror stories along those lines out of this particular discussion and stay focused on the best-case possibilities of both subjects.


**EDIT:** Thank you to those of you who have been willing to engage me on the substantive pedagogical questions.  I have re-thought my initial claim and now concede that there are alternatives to the traditional algebra sequence when it comes to teaching abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills.  I still stand by my argument that statistics fundamentally stands apart from math, and should probably be seen as a separate subject with some connections to math (akin to physics or computer science) rather than as an optional class within the math department.  But there are alternatives to the algebra-geometry-trig-calculus sequence that might better reinforce the connections between statistics and math while still accomplishing all the important educational goals.


**To those of you more interested in debating the logistical nuts and bolts (concerns about burdensome mandates on schools, etc.):** thank you also for your participation in the conversation.  Some have made arguments that all state mandates on school curriculum are unnecessarily burdensome or will cost too much; I believe this premise has empirically denied, so these arguments are not convincing to me.  Others have made the point that, in the event that states are unwilling to add new credit hours to their diploma requirements, we risk adding statistics at the expense of electives or core courses.  This is a more compelling argument, but ultimately a risk I am willing to take, since I believe that in most if not all states there is room in the existing credit structure to responsibly add statistics in place of at least one course.  As a separate issue, I think increasing credit hour minimums and extended school days are serious proposals that should be given consideration as possibilities, though it is not my intent to make a full argument in favor of them here.  Unless you have something substantially different to offer than the above two arguments, I doubt I will be convinced by further discussion along these lines.


Thank you again to all who responded.

I think [what I said then](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3eqdj5/cmv_a_statistics_course_should_be_required_as/cthkp5o) applies here: if we have to chose, discrete math is more valuable than statistics.

This is mostly going to be an argument that discrete math should replace something in the calculus-track curriculum. However, many introductory discrete math courses spend a fair amount of time covering statistics, and I think that's very valuable for many of the same reasons you've covered. I think that discrete math courses typically paint a very coherent story up to statistics -- much more so than jumping straight into statistics. You talk about deductive reasoning, set theory, combinatorics, and probability before getting to statistics. I think learning and understanding all of those things helps frame statistics in a more intuitive way. For example, Bayes' Theorem (which is, in my experience, a topic in most introductory statistics courses) is much better understood with a firm understanding of deductive reasoning, set theory, and probability.

You say this about calculus-track curricula: 

&gt; In a well-taught algebra, geometry, or calculus class, by contrast, students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively, learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence, solve non-routine problems, and use mathematics of all types to analyze real-world phenomena.

I fervently agree that learning to reason deductively is important. Wouldn't you say that a better way to learn deductive reasoning is to teach it directly? 

&gt; You can argue that a deep facility with ""abstract"" math has little importance in the ""real world,"" but increasingly the 21st century economy does reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem-solving, even if you are never directly using specific skills (the classic ""when will I ever need the quadratic formula in real life"" bugbear). Finally, learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields, which statistics training will not replace. Thus, BOTH statistics and math, as separate disciplines, should have a role in the high school curriculum.

Again -- totally agree abstract reasoning is important. I just don't think calculus or algebra are the best topics to teach this skill to the average student. Too often they devolve into rote application of formula or theorems that have no meaning to the student. Teaching deductive reasoning directly generally doesn't suffer from this problem, because the theorems that do exist are incredibly intuitive.

In closing, I'd propose that a better change to high school math curriculum would be:

1. For the general population, teach discrete math instead of (pre-)calculus. Topics should include deductive reasoning, set theory, probability, and statistics.
2. For more advanced students, offer followup courses in both statistics and calculus.  (I guess this is probably already the case at most good schools).","I haven't really seen this point brought up here, so I may as well: you seem to be assuming the typical algebra/trig/precalc/calc track is representative of pure math. Many would disagree with that. Calculus and the classes leading up to it are a notoriously horrible representation of pure mathematics and, while I don't really have a great argument against putting statistics into standard high school educations (apart from the lack-of-resources argument others have mentioned), I can at least argue that, whether or not statistics is thrown in, calculus should probably be thrown out.

I'm just going to preemptively say, though - Lockhart did a much better job articulating it than I can in his short paper [A Mathematician's Lament](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf). I don't mean to pass the debating on to someone else, but if you've got time I'd really recommend reading it.

The main point is that calculus and the courses leading up to it are far too rooted in applications - they're treated as though they're going to be useful to students later in life, because in the minds of administrators, that's how putting them in the curriculum is justified. Because of that, teachers and students alike end up perpetuating the myth that math is, at its core, supposed to be useful and applicable. That's entirely the wrong idea, though. There is math that's useful, but applications aren't the reason we practice math, nor the reason we're interested in it. The real value of math is that it's beautiful, interesting, and most of all personally enriching. It helps develop important parts of our minds, from articulating ideas to critical thinking to problem solving. Calculus is the centerpiece of the high school math education not because it's beautiful or enriching but because it's perceived to be useful, and that's harmful to students (who, generally speaking, waste time learning it without ever using it) and to the general population (who, generally speaking, regard math as a tedious object to be wielded only for the purposes of science).

So, if the people creating high school curricula wanted to put in a ""math"" class that's actually useful, statistics would be a much better choice, I'm sure. I believe many more people would find themselves being able to apply it to their daily lives. I would hope the world doesn't forget what math actually is, though, and I would hope that, whether statistics is added or not, calculus is either replaced (by something that's actually done for its own value) or dropped entirely.",A,B,"I believe that Reply A is more persuasive and more likely to change the original poster's view. This is because Reply A provides a structured argument for why discrete math should be taught instead of calculus, highlighting the importance of deductive reasoning, set theory, probability, and statistics. The argument is well-supported and offers a clear alternative to the traditional math curriculum. Additionally, Reply A acknowledges the importance of abstract reasoning, but suggests that it can be better taught through discrete math rather than calculus. On the other hand, Reply B focuses more on the shortcomings of the traditional math curriculum, particularly calculus, without providing a clear alternative or a structured argument for why statistics should replace calculus. Therefore, Reply A is more likely to change the original poster's view by offering a compelling alternative and supporting it with relevant points."
