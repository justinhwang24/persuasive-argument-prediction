The growing number of people with vegetarian/vegan friends and family members also means that more people are being exposed to delicious vegetarian/vegan food and even learning how to cook it, all of which chips away at the all-too-common notion that any meal without meat isn't worth eating.

Helping society at large reduce its meat consumption is really important because meat production has such an enormous environmental impact, especially with regard to climate change. The exact contribution of animal agriculture to climate change is disputed, but the most widely accepted statistics seem to put animal agriculture at about 15-25% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, with some estimates reaching as high as nearly 50%. While it certainly is possible to raise meat in a sustainable and environmentally healthy way, in practice 78% of beef, 95% of pork, and 99% of chicken is raised in factory farms, so getting people to eat less meat overall is very important. Even a 10% reduction in overall meat consumption could make a significant difference. According to the Earth Day Network, if everybody in the U.S. did not eat meat or cheese for just one day a week, it would be the equivalent of not driving 91 billion miles. (I'm not sure how that figure was calculated, but if it's even close to correct, it demonstrates the kind of difference skipping meat just three meals a week could make.)","In short, the reality is: It adds up.

It's about changing the discourse. A few decades ago, far fewer people were taking vegetarianism and veganism seriously. Now we have conversations about animal rights and welfare in public. There have been more animal cruelty related posts and comment threads on Reddit in the past year than I remember previously — and far less RAH RAH WHAT'S WRONG WITH EATING MEAT type replies. More and more restaurants are offering vegetarian and vegan options.

And at that point, change will be sweeping and sudden.","I think I see where you are coming from, especially concerning one of your other answers where you said that it is very rare to meet vegetarians in your country. I'd say you look at it the wrong way, though.

As you said elsewhere, meat consumtion is rising. The reason for this is that it is easy and normal to eat meat, and not normal and harder when you do not. The more people that primarily eat vegetarian and vegan food, the more plausible it is for restaurants to sell vegetarian food, and the easier it is for people to choose to be a vegetarian, and the more vegetarian and vegan food is offered in other circumstances. In my region of the world, and then I mean maybe the closest 5 to 15 million people, the availability and accessibility of vegetarian and vegan options has risen dramatically in the last few decades, even though meat consumtion has risen as well due to changed habits of omnivores.. but this is turning, as of a few years ago. Omnivores are now lessening their amount of meat in their diet, and even more people are turning vegan and vegetarian or just ""I don't eat meat very often""-etarian, and it has gone to the point when arranging some events the crew don't even ask who is vegetarian, who is vegan anymore. They just simply offer vegan food for everyone instead, unless someone explicitly specify that they need meat, or whatever.

Since meat need approximately ten times as much land to produce the same amount of food as veggies, and meat production is said to stand for close to 20% of the amount of climate change gases, this may have an enormous effect. Not very much for each veg*n by themselves, but due to the effect they have in motivating each other, motivating others, making selling veggies plausible for restaurants, and in the end have a so much larger effect on the world than they ever would by themselves.

Additionally, it's probably substantially easier to move there (if you get a bachelors you can probably move temporarily under a TN visa to try it out), and there are some other perks as well such as your Canada Pension Plan payments counting towards Social Security and vice versa.

So, I know second hand from them what it's like coming here from different places in the world. Basically, the more Danish you look and act, the easier a time you will have. 

You will face stigmatization if you are from Eastern Europe, since they have a bad rep among a lot of Danes, due to a lot of home robberies and burglaries committed by Eastern Europeans.

If you are black you stand out a lot, and will face a lot of fear from people, and in return sometimes being treated ""with caution"". The same probably goes, albeit to a lesser degree, if you look like you are from the middle east.

If you are American you will face some prejudices that you might be arrogant and stupid. Generally, those prejudices only come from stupid people.

Not speaking Danish is not a problem if you decide to live in one of the larger cities. Danes generally do not mind speaking English, but older people in the smaller cities often have a view that if you move here, it's disrespectful not to learn the language.

"By ""practical reason,"" I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election.  I admit there can be other reasons to vote--social pressure, solidarity, civic pride, etc.  But on a practical level, I can reasonably expect no difference between the world in which I vote and the world in which I stay home, except that in the former I'd have to go out of my way to perform additional actions.  If I'm trying to decide whether to perform those actions, based on pure self-interest, there is no reason for me to vote.  I'm setting this at the level of national elections (specifically thinking of U.S. elections) because it's true that, given a small enough ""nation,"" your individual vote would carry a significant probability of making a difference.  

This is a classic example of a [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action), and after considering this class of problems thoroughly, I've come to the conclusion that there is no self-interested practical reason to participate in these cases, barring external motivators (such as added incentives).

Suppose a state like Wyoming (voter turnout of 249,000 last general election) was polling 50/50 (or 47/47, or 43/43, etc.) going into the election. A Wyomingite could guess there's a thousand or so votes separating the candidates at most, and determine that these odds are worth the minimal investment required to make the trip to the voting booths.

And it's not like this is purely theoretical either - there have been a few examples of state elections being decided by only a couple hundreds of votes.

Alright, so, i was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while i am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, i will only do so if you can actually change my mind. I will not give up easily.
I believe I can change this country, better yet, this world for the better. The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution. Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly. We save the weak. I personally believe that we should execute the weak. yes, this sounds harsh but let me explain why. We are not advancing as a race. For now though, we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on. Another massive problem we are facing is over population, we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates.
You look at animals and if an animal doesn't want to eat, it dies, if a human doesn't want to eat, it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder. More importantly that human is allowed to procreate. We allow shitty genetics to be passed on. We SAVE the WEAK. We also allow these morbidly obese, incredibly stupid people live and breed. If an animal in the wild isn't fit, or cannot attract a mate, it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics. Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children, which fucks with the gene pool. I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary i'll continue on later.
Now to determine who is to be executed. The type of people i want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society. If you weigh 500 pounds but you're incredibly smart, you can still make a contribution to society. The opposite is also true, if you're borderline retarded but you're very physically fit, you can also contribute to society. People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn't want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating.
What will determine who is executed: At the age of 14 years old, annual testing will begin based on birthday. There will be three tests, a mental test, a physical test, and a psychological test. Your Mental test exactly 3 months after your birthday and your physical test 9 months after your birthday. Tests will vary depending on your age, the older you get the harder they become, until the age of 20 where they will remain the same until 35 and gradually work their way down until the age of 65 where no further testing will be required. At the age of 20 we will also introduce psychological testing which will continue until the age of 65.
What the tests will consist of: The mental test will be a basic evaluation of your ability to do math, your ability to read and write, and your basic understanding of the sciences. This test should not be difficult, anyone who has at least a D average in school should be just fine. For the physical test, every age group will be required to complete a mile in 16 minutes. This is a very easy time to make, you can walk that pace. Physical tests will include varying push up or sit up tests depending on age group. There may be a few other exercises required in certain age groups, and the amount of repetitions will also vary depending on age. this should be easy for anyone who isn't morbidly obese. Next is the psychological test. These will be administered every 5 years to insure mental stability and health of everyone. We want the mental health of our gene pool to be good as well. Lastly, there will be certain ways to be omitted to testing, ALL WILL BE FROM SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY, the main one being in the military. If you served in the military without being dishonorably discharged, you will be exempt from any further testing in your lifetime. Another example of a way to be omitted from testing is by paying for it. The cost will be $25,000 per year, per person. Many will be angry that it's giving more power to the rich, but i see it as a valid way of determining someones potential for making a contribution to society. If you are rich, I will almost guarantee you are either physically fit enough or mentally fit enough to pass the tests and you would have been fine anyway. AN IMPORTANT NOTE: You will only have to pass 2 out of 3 tests.
How we will execute people: We will set up an organization in charge of carrying out testing and executing people. My idea is to possibly have the military be in charge of this, though I haven't had the time to think too much into that, this I am very open to other ideas on. The method of execution i think will be best is the firing squad. 8 men, 2 with real bullets to ensure death, 6 with blanks for the obvious reason. For those who are unaware, my understanding is that firing squads use primarily blanks so the gunmen aren't aware of who actually killed the person so they don't have trouble with living life after killing someone.
Now another thing i would like to do that isn't executing people, but will improve our gene pool is preventing certain people from having children. People with MORE THAN two generations of diagnosed cancer or potentially terminal illnesses that tend to be passed on genetically will be sterilized. These people will not be allowed to produce offspring, however we will make it easy for them to adopt if they would like to have children.
I would also like to place a limit on the amount of children a person may have. The maximum number of children a person may have is 3, which is a very reasonable amount. It should slow the rate of population increase or possibly make the population decrease due to some couples not having children or only having 1 child. There is no reason to have more than 3 children because at that point you're just putting a burden on society. If say you already have 2 children and you would like to have a third but you end up with twins, triplets, or even more, you will be allowed to keep them as it wasn't your intent to have that many. When you hit the limit for children you will be sterilized.
This is all i can think of for now, if i remember more of my plan i will post. So reddit users, change my view.","You are complaining about humans not letting evolution take place (I'll come to that too), but at the same time you want to counteract what humans evolved to become - supportive of the weak.

The fact that humans help each other out and save the weak (first in tribes, now in nation states) allowed humans to take over the world. You help me now that I'm weak, I help you another time when you're weak. We both survive, instead of neither of us surviving. Remember, it's survival of the fittest, and fittest doesn't necessarily mean strongest.

Now, I don't see how we're not letting evolution take place. Evolution doesn't mean that in every generation only the strongest are allowed to survive. Evolution means that the genes which are most likely to survive through multiple generations in bodies that are likely to reproduce are likely to be spread the most. So if being determined enough to acquire sufficient wealth to be able to reproduce even if you are fat means that you are more likely to reproduce, then that means that that's a gene that's likely to spread, and that's evolution.

And if you really want to solve overpopulation problems, there's far less radical ways to solve that (development help for third world countries etc.). Or just kill everyone who is too old to reproduce.","I could write two dozen things in opposition to this, but just to gather a few basic points.

-You should understand, if you don't(seems like you don't), that what you're referring is [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics), a field of thought that has existed for about as long as Darwin's theory of evolution has has a long, *very* sordid history.  Most notably, it was one of the primary justifications for Nazi Germany's genocidal practices.

-Despite it's attractiveness to certain political persuasions, [overpopulation is simply not a concern with legitimate scientific backing](https://www.pop.org/content/debunking-myth-overpopulation).  In fact, if the world continues to increase on its path of modernization, democratization and secularism, *under*population is the issue we will have to be concerned.  In highly educated, relatively prosperous societies, birth rates become lower and lower, to the point where they are now beginning to become lower than death rates in some places.  In America, if you excluded immigration, the population would not be growing.  In Japan, it's shrinking and aging outright.  It's only because of the poorer places in the world that population continues to grow substantially, and even then, the worldwide birth rate is shrinking slowly every year.

Simply replace ""they"" with ""whateverthefuckyouwant"" and all those problems are avoided.

Personally, I think gender-neutral singular ""they"" is perfectly fine, and trying to forcibly shoe-horn in another pronoun is pretty doomed to failure, because language isn't really a top-down process like that, but much more organic.

HOWEVER...

It would be nice to have a _singular_ gender-neutral pronoun instead of ""they.""  They is linguistically awkward because it's plural.  When I first came out, I decided to ask people to just use _she_, and one of the reasons for this is because there is no singular gender-neutral pronoun.  I agree that the proliferation of them is a problem, for me because it makes the adoption of one that's actually useful from a language perspective less likely.

I agree it's quite unlikely in the short term because we haven't settled on ___ONE___ of xe/ze/hir/etc... to describe non-binary gender identities.  But it certainly would be nice if it were possible in the long term (i.e., 30-50 yrs).",0.35,0.35,B,A,False,"Before: 80

"A friend and I were talking about the current candidates and she couldn't understand why Trump was doing so well in the polls.  The best I could articulate it is that he is the most populist candidate out, his politics are moderate but heavily nationalist, his demeanor is one of our idealized archetypes, and he is wealthy but appears genuine, achieving a halo effect (unlike Romney.)  

After realizing this, I asked several other people, and realized that basically my friends, like Clinton, don't like how he communicates, but then have no major disagreement with the content.

Am I missing something?  Is there a good reason to dismiss him as a candidate?  More importantly, who is real competition for him?

***EDIT****
From todays conversations:
I see an argument for why he may not have a good chance in an election (delta awarded), mainly in that whatever percentage of his 25% popularity is republican is all he may get from the republicans, and as a more mainstream candidate arises, the split votes wont go to him (that is, the people who polled for him may be all that would poll for him in the primary, given any other more mainstream republican candidate.

However, I have seen no compelling argument for why he is not a populist candidate.  Some have tried to narrow the definition of a populist to being representative of a position or policies that in some fashion clearly serve the underserve or/and the majority, but this is difficult to define, and ignores the perception.  One person argued at length that the self perception of the constituency as victim and the candidate's policy being to address that sense of victimization is what makes them populist, and while I can agree that it is a fine definition, the person then asserts that this is not trump, and I disagree, as Trump clearly paints the American people as victimized by poor, self interested leadership, a corrupt political culture, and compromised ideas and strategies, and his entire platform is about going in as a normal private citizen and fixing it.

Many (most?) have simply tried to argue that he is too insulting to win, but I remain unconvinced that that would stop a sizable percentage of Americans from voting for him.  This is because Americans don't actually value formality and decorum as much as power and conviction.  For the same reason that this is the America we have, I can't see how a candidate, fundamentally in favor of current nationalist policies, but simultaneously harping on being free from big money interests and the many leadership deficits that are frustrating Americans, isn't hitting so many of the right cords with mainstream America.

If he sticks to a policy (rather than sentiment,) that is antithetical to a group, then another would be preferred by that group.  But a career politician vs Trump, both speaking in vagaries, I see Trump coming out on top rather consistently.  (Saw a headline today, Trump took a hit in polls for being in favor of higher taxes, this looks like an example of the very thing.)

Democrats have branded him racist, sexist, etc. but is there a Republican they're not *also* branding as those things?  

Trump gets an extra heap of dismissal because he's also not exactly a Republican either.  There are a lot of people in the party who have a strong interest in making sure an outsider doesn't take the reigns. 

I think Jeb Bush is still his biggest competition overall.  Trump is the front runner because ridiculously early polling has him ahead but polling this early is notoriously unreliable and campaigning hasn't really started yet.  He's going to have to come up with a platform at some point to run on.

I wouldn't exactly call him a populist.  He certainly says some things some people want to hear but I think it's probably more accurate to call him the candidate for those fed up with career politicians.

At the end of the day, he might draw enough to be a spoiler in some early races (and maybe win a plurality), but once the other vote splitters drop out, a Jeb Bush or Scott Walker will appeal a lot more to primary voters.

"so random battles that just happen with no warning, while you're walking, just like, warpy screen, you're in a battle now stuff. this really only applies to turn based games, in fact, i don't know of any real time games that have this system of enemy encounters. i don't think they have the need. 

it's annoying as hell. you take 4 steps after getting out of a battle, and arrive in another one that the run functino won't work for and you start taking damage, and then you can't escape again so you take more damage, and that just starts a whole snowball of ""oh my god fuck this shit."" meanwhile, the battles themselves are just often an unnecessary, repetitive, near useless way to grind. the millionth time we saw a zubat in pokemon, it. it wasn't really doing anything for us.

with an rpg game, the logic seems simple enough, i guess - there's a turn based system of combat, and there needs to be a way to trigger the combat screen from the overworld. and it shouldn't necessarily be purely predictable, should it? the player needs to progress and level up so they can meet their bigger challenges in the future. putting aside the discussion about other games mechanics and why in some cases it works much worse than others - there's just better, non annoying ways of doing that now. off the top of my head, paper mario on n64 had visible enemy mobs walking around. if you collided with them, you started a battle. that makes *much* more sense. it's not annoying. it doesn't happen every five steps. it doesn't come out of nowhere. it still accomplishes the same purpose that random encounters do. invisible enemies starting a 5 second battle transition, with a chance that you can't run, especially if you're in over your head and trying to get out of an area, with no ability to see it coming, no warning, no possibility of avoiding it, is just, bad. especially when even something like the paper mario system exists. at least that way, if you have no items, and are on your way back to somewhere because you're too injured, you have a chance of maybe avoiding the enemy mobs.

Also, games like Paper Mario and Final Fantasy Mystic Quest can use this sort of visible enemy system because they have no overworlds.  Monsters could be set up in bottlenecks in dungeons, but on the overworld there would be no way to force confrontations since you could walk around any enemy you see.

These are largely unrelated topics, yet at least 80% of the time people hold these 'suites' of ideas.

People seldom shift on these big issues, because views aren't evidence based, they're ideological. The few times people do change its because of one of two reasons.

An overall change in societal norms on the issue. Same sex marriage is a good example of this. This wasn't even on the agenda 20 years ago. There has been little 'data' to change peoples minds; we've just had a kind of cultural shift, and now its broadly accepted. It wasn't data or evidence that changed people's minds, it was a change in societies norms.

The other thing which I believe *can* change folks' minds is personal experience/change. I've known people to retire, or have  a health crisis, which shakes up their whole outlook, including views on ''the big issues. Or perhaps a personal brush with an issue-""My son came out, now I'm pro-same sex marriage""

So persuade me people are actually rational, and can be convinced by actual facts-CMV

[EDIT]:  To clarify I mean objective evidence(data, stats, facts), as opposed to emotive appeal(personal anecdotes/experience.  I'm sure there's some grey area, but that's the general idea)

[""evidence"" in this context means objective stats or data, and doesn't include personal experience, or one emotionally affecting news event(e.g ""Sandy Hook really got to me, now I'm anti-guns"") ]","Are your set of ""big issues"" specifically ""issues that are controversial/unresolved in 2015"", and your set of evidence specifically ""evidence that is available in 2015""?  Because if so, you might imagine that the reason the issue is unresolved is because the fact pattern can be interpreted at least two ways.

How about some previous large issues?  

*Evolution  (evidence resolved via science)

*Empiricism vs innate knowledge (evidence resolved via science)

*Heliocentric astronomy (evidence resolved via science)

*Prohibition (evidence resolved via a grand societal experiment)

I would disagree with your characterization of same sex marriage attitudes.  What happened was that the gay community made a conscious effort to encourage one another to ""come out"".  People suddenly had many more data points, and were thus able to generalize from something approximating [actual set of gay people] instead of from the very-skewed sample they'd previously known about.  They hadn't previously known that gay people were so normal because the normal gay people were mostly closeted.","This varies a lot based on what type of issue you are talking about.

I'm surprised you used climate change to support your view - to me climate change is a clear example of evidence *clearly* driving people's views.  The climate change ""debate"" is politicians arguing over science, but the issue itself is a matter of scientists, and among credible scientists there isn't really a ""debate"" because the evidence all points solidly in one direction.  The arguments against climate change come largely from corporate interests and the politicians and ""scientists"" bought by corporate interests.  In other words, the scientific community largely agrees (based on the evidence) that climate change is a major challenge, and some politicians (who are not experts in climate science) have accused the entire scientific community of pulling some sort of scheme.

"The expense of a higher education has been a hot button issue for a number of years but the fact that students take on huge loans and graduate with huge sums of debt is a function of their own suboptimal decisions.

Assuming the worst case and a student pays full sticker price, that's around 125k in debt. But with almost all private schools, there are plentiful scholarship and grant opportunities. Even for students who support themselves (meaning no financial help from their parents), these options make the 125k number far less. This forgets the fact that according to the same source, students can attend an in-state university for just shy of 10,000, for a far more affordable (and worst case) of 40k. And this is without considering alternatives to college.

"Let me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by rational means, rather than a mixture of reason, emotion, tradition, religion, evolutionary instinct etc. I will use one clear example, for the sake of focus, while knowing that there are other examples of this as well. I will talk about producing off-spring.

In my experience, people against procreating articulate 3-4 arguments against having children. Firstly, that having children will detrimentally affect the environment (1). New humans means more consumers of the Earth's resources and more producers of waste. The long term viability of the earth with exponentially more consumers and producers is uncertain.  Secondly, the cost of having children can be astronomical (2). Thirdly, you become isolated to your social circle and to your spouse due to the time need to take care of your child. 

I present these arguments not because they uniquely matter, but because they seem valid. They are, shall we say for the sake of argument, true.  However, in the pursuit of being rational, these arguments have contradicted one of the most basic and scientific principles of life, namely that animals produce off-spring to survive. It is basic evolutionary biology. We observe this in every known creature; we observe our own instincts to sexual activity and pleasure; we observe people's special fondness to babies (3). Yet, despite this obvious teology of humans, the rational arguments are given preference. This seems to play out on the societal level. Education levels and industrialization (a proxy for culture/rationality) correlate with lower birth rates (4). 

In conclusion, this is but one of many examples where hyper-rationality creates a social pressure that contradicts human instinct.

I also suggest r/childfree for a celebration of people who are following their instincts by NOT having children. They are bucking a strong societal pressure to live their lives like they actually want to. Is this due to an increasingly rational society? Possibly. But they are not fighting their animal nature.

There is still a strong social pressure to procreate even if your circumstances make it an irrational choice, and you'll find examples of that on the subreddit. To say that higher education and industrialization (your rationality proxy) results in a lower birthrate because people are making a rational decision to not have children despite their desire to doesn't make much sense in light of Sweden. They put a lot of effort as a country into supporting parents and children http://www.oecd.org/els/family/swedenssupportforparentswithchildreniscomprehensiveandeffectivebutexpensive.htm

Rationality doesn't seem to be causing people to completely dismiss their emotional desire to have children in most cases. All of the other factors of emotion, tradition, religion, etc are still very much at play.

I think both sides of this argument are missing the point here (and I do agree with points on both sides). While I do think that it is possible for automation to replace the lion's share of modern jobs (I just watched a lecture yesterday where it was claimed that only ~20% of factory jobs were lost overseas whereas they discovered in retrospect that almost ~80% were lost due to automation), I also think economists opposing this view have a good point when they say that we can create new jobs, ones that we can't even imagine today, to keep the majority of people employed to the same degree as today.


That said, I think there are two *very important* factors missing from this discussion: 


1) The inherent value of a newly created jobs compared to past jobs, and

2) Our economic system's ability to accommodate accelerating technological change in terms of employment


Regarding the first point, people tend to become disillusioned about work on a psychological level when they feel that their work isn't adding any value. That was one of Marx's core critiques about Capitalism when he argued how essential it was for the workers to control the means of production. The less valuable/necessary people percieve their jobs, regardless of how well compensated they are for it, the less satisfied they will be with their lives. I recently read an article about how the vast majority of people in cities like London, a place where many people (office drones) are employed in information industries doing jobs that didn't exist ten to fifteen years ago, feel that their jobs are utterly meaningless in the grand scheme of things (and they're not wrong) and many subsequently feel depressed.


London is an extreme example but rest assured, with increasing automation, most other places will start to catch up. Information and information-based services will be (already is) the most important product that we produce, not physical goods/labour. This means is that the work we do as humans is becoming more work for the sake of work. A century ago, the majority of work that we did were things that quite obviously needed to be done. We repaired things, we built things, we provided crucial services, and so on. Think about ten people around you today and ask yourself: do the jobs they do create a net benefit for their lives and the lives of people around them, or are their jobs essentially bullshit?


You'd be surprised at how many jobs today add little to no value. Even if they do add some value, it's often not (nearly) enough to rationalize it taking up 40+ hours of someone's life each week. This trend is only going to get worse, too, as more and more ""critical"" jobs are automated/rendered obsolete and more and more bullshit jobs get added to the pool. It's no wonder that people are miserable: we've seen a kind of spiritual decay where the vast majority of people have become miserable in their employment and that it's only going to get worse until we decide enough is enough and no longer require people to work in order to provide for themselves. This is all exacerbated by the fact that we're collectively more educated and aware than we've ever been, and that we all know the most surefire way to become wealthy is to game the system (like on Wall Street), not create value for others.


As per the second point, say you disagree with my first point and want to argue that the value of new jobs being added to the economy is worthwhile enough to continue to employ the majority of people in new jobs. Fair enough. The other problem with this is that a lot of the jobs being added don't fit into the employment model of the past century. It's becoming harder and harder for companies to justify hiring people full time, putting them all in an office and making them sit in cubicles for 40+ hours per week. Just look at the business models of Uber, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram and so on: these companies are indicative of a 21st century employment model. They are not traditional vertically integrated companies that need to hire tens of thousands of people in order to function, instead they get by on hiring a handful of people and providing a service to more than a billion people. Traditional vertically integrated companies are learning from this as well and reducing the number of employees they have (when they can get away with it). 


Thanks to the internet and accelerating technological change, these 21st century business models are scalable in a way that traditional business models weren't. A lot of the information-based services and distribution models around them that needed to exist last century are totally irrelevant now and are in the middle of a mass extinction. That's why we've been hearing the death rattle from the MPAA and many other large ""information brokers"": they're irrelevant and they're flailing wildly trying to find a way to prop up the old business model just so they can survive (while making everyone hate them in the process). We don't need a middle man anymore, the software is the middle man with algorithms replacing humans as gatekeepers to 1s and 0s. 


So regardless of what you think about automation and job creation, you can't dodge the fact that our current employment models no longer make sense. The world is full of offices that exist for the sake of tradition (and supposed information security) where the majority of people sit at their desks doing valueless busy work and surfing the internet every chance they get. That's why we're seeing a huge boom in freelancing. A (regulated) Uber-style employment is likely going to be the new employment model for the next few decades. Companies are going to want to hire freelancers (from anywhere in the world), have them sign NDAs, produce X amount of work for them and those freelancers might do work for 2-3 companies at the same time.


Blue collar work is no exception. Companies like McDonalds are slowly and carefully revealing to the world that they intend to phase out many of their workers in the coming years, something I expect will be accelerated by minimum wage increases. Retailers, large and small, are beginning to becoming nothing more than glorified show rooms and many are losing the battle against online shopping. Jobs in the transportation industry (taxis, trucking etc) see the writing on the wall. ""Sharing economy"" services like AirBnB and Uber will continue to have an impact. Services like Instagram and smartphone cameras killed vertically integrated behemoths like Kodak. The list goes on.


Anyway, even if you think that automation is going to displace rather than replace people, I think you still need to concede that replacement is possible if we allow it, and that there are good arguments for replacement over creating jobs for the sake of creating jobs. First and foremost, unless we do something radical (like basic income) a lot of people (especially those not educated or business/tech savvy) are going to fall in the cracks opened up by accelerating change (like anyone who works in the transportation industry today). 

I also think there is another, even better argument for allowing ourselves to drop out of the labour market if we want to, and that argument is an environmental one: we overproduce and overconsume more than any other point in history, it is unsustainable and that we need to start producing and consuming less and therefore we need to start thinking up a new way to organize economic activity around the concept of sustainability.

**Late edit**: added tl;dr

**Tl;dr** 

- Basic human needs are finite and can be totally satisfied with automation in the foreseeable future
- Current levels of automation have already displaced humans away from work that has obvious value
- New jobs have increasingly less value than before when they are created in spaces where they can't be automated (yet) and thus job satisfaction is on the decline
- Many new jobs are created for the sake of creating jobs (a symptom of past bureaucracies / legislation / remaining inertia from 20th century employment practices)
- We increasingly overproduce and over consume because of our economic model and increased efficiency over time
- The employment system is shifting from full time to part time freelancing type employment, which can be inhumane without the proper framework in place (basic income) 
- We need to change our antiquated view of work where we think every able bodied person should work to one where we see work as optional and less centralized 
- We need to think of a new economic system or else things will start getting ugly and this is true regardless of whether you think future automation will displace or replace humans","I'm getting a PhD in this now.  Over the next 20 years things will get crazy.  To look over the horizon, there's a few technologies that are just now coming together.

 * Cheap Sensors: 6 years ago I wanted to make an RC Segway.  I started on it, but you either had to hand build a sensor from cheaper ones or buy one pre-made for $600.  Now, those sensors are $2 a piece and come in cell phones.

 * Computing Power: For things like automatic cars you need a lot of fast processing power because you can't wait 5 seconds to figure out if you're about to crash.  Right now, things are just getting to the level where a $500 or so computer can do enough calculations to have something workable.

Those 2 things will make a lot of people redundant.  It might be the biggest change society has ever experienced.  Robots building robots, driving everyone around and doing everything for us.  It'll change politics and how people view living life, but we'll have so much stuff it might be a lot better.

For the fear part, this changes war completely.  I think robotics is a WMD worse than atomic bombs.  Its hard to make atomic bombs, and countries can monitor each other, but anyone can download a program from the internet, load it into a robot, and turn it into an indiscriminate killing machine.

If you check out a video of a high powered quadcopter, then look at another of tricks people can make them do, the technology exists today for a small government or large group of people to make killing machines that could wipe out a city.

"Some of you you believe the right to bear arms is inherent, my question to you is: ""how does it come about that this right is inherent?""

What makes this right inherent?

There is a difference between rights granted  by law and natural rights. Laws can define where natural rights are legally applicable. But laws can't give or take away inherent/natural rights. (Laws can, however, violate or protect those rights.)

There still must be a logical derivation of this right from nature if it exists.

If ""Natural law derives from the nature of man and the world, just as physical law derives from the nature of space, time, and matter."" my question is, how exactly is it that you are proposing the right to firearms derives from nature?

""It just does"" is not a sufficient answer.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights

Explain why we have the natural right to self defense, and how, logically, that right extends to include firearm ownership. Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated.

I actually think guns are the least of our problems, and I'm not really a ""gun-grabber"" because there are a couple dozen things I'd rather do first. (And if those happen, guns would mostly only be used for hunting, and target practice. And the potential for a strong national defence, like they ought to be.) I'd rather get people educated and out of poverty. Etc. I tell you this so you can understand, I'm an open mind on this issue, and if you can't convince me, you probably won't convince anyone.

To be clear: I could give a **** about gun rights, I don't see any logical derivation of those rights from nature. So far as I can see they are only legal rights and not natural rights at all.

At the same time, people who actually spend effort and time opposing gun rights annoy me, because (duh) there will always be weapons and violence until people get healthy and free. focusing actions on a wedge issue like guns serves to divide, and sow fear, rather than to unify and bring progress. Discussion, though, is another matter.

I am currently against both ""gun grabbers"" (practically) and gun rights (ideologically). So I am mostly heavily neutral on this subject. I have serious questions about the central dogmas of both sides of this debate.

Tell me why I should no longer ideologically oppose gun rights. Show the logical derivation from nature, which I believe you are claiming exists. currently without an understanding of the justification for the claim that gun rights are natural rights, It is my view that many legal freedoms or impositions are a matter of practicality, justified by the basic and overriding human drive to form a safe, harmonious, and productive society, and then that guns are simply impractical toward this end.

if you can't convince me of this, (or at least correctly formulate _any_ argument defending your position) , you are probably not really going to convince anyone.

But If your thought is that the right to firearms is derived from the right to self defend would it not make more sense that the natural right to self defend justifies the legal right to live in a firearm free environment. Since guns take more lives than they save?

To claim that a right is derived from nature without showing the logic of the derivation is equally meaningless as to claim that a right is granted by God.

I see no logical derivation from nature for the right of humans to bear arms. (Bonus: I can't imagine that there is any which wouldn't also ""justify"" the ""rights of monkeys to bear arms"".)

I invite you to Change My View.","I'll do my best with this.

&gt;Explain why we have the natural right to self defense, and how, logically, that right extends to include firearm ownership. Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated.

In the link you provided it's pretty clear that the right to live is a natural right. Well, if you are ever in a situation where your right to live is being threatened, how else are you going to defend that right? To me, logic dictates that the right to live and the right to self defense are mutually exclusive.

Now, if you accept my statements above then we can move to why gun rights are a natural right. It's best to use examples of self defense situations. 

Here's an example of situation people have and could face. I'm hanging out in my house and someone (or a couple people) breaks in and they have a baseball bat(s) or some other deadly objects. If it is my right to live and therefore my right to self defense then I should have the best means of self defense available to me. Now, just to be clear, the best means in general isn't the best means in all situations, just that it's going to be better suited for a variety of situations. This is where a gun comes in to the picture. 

I'm in my house that now has a stranger(s) that's armed with a weapon(s), what am I supposed to do? There is the intention to harm me and I have to choose how best to defend myself. I could grab a bat, a golf club, a knife, etc., but what's the likelihood of one of those options actually being viable in this situation? I would be going toe to toe with someone who could be bigger, stronger and more prepared. What are my chances of survival and hopefully being unharmed in this situation? 

Another option I could have is grabbing a gun, which is capable of dealing necessary force within a matter of seconds while potentially keeping some distance between me and that attacker. Now I have to ask the same question, what are my chances of survival and hopefully being unharmed in this situation? 

&gt;But If your thought is that the right to firearms is derived from the right to self defend would it not make more sense that the natural right to self defend justifies the legal right to live in a firearm free environment.

Here's the problem, if you take away firearms then there is no longer an equalizer for a whole variety of situations, just like the example I have presented. There is the potential that you will be in a situation where you are having to defend yourself from someone else that has a gun, but at least it would be a lot closer to a ""fair"" fight. Having a gun doesn't require much strength, size, agility, etc., but with things like a bat, knife and hammer, those attributes absolutely play a role. 

&gt;Since guns take more lives than they save?

There's isn't any proof that this is a fact. Since the number of defensive gun uses is a very hard statistic to gather, it is unknown if guns save more live or cost more lives. One thing you have to consider is if you get rid of guns, that doesn't inherently mean that those lives wouldn't have been lost by other means. If you look at countries like England and Australia, the total number of murders and crime was unaffected by their gun control measures. If you actually look at the crime and murder rates in those countries, those statistics actually increased the first couple years after their gun bans. They did eventually start to decrease, but the US has also steadily decreased in the same periods. Sure there is less gun related crimes in those countries, but crimes were just committed by other means.

I feel like I'm rambling on a bit at this point, so I'll leave it at this for now. If you feel like there is an important point of yours that I've messed, I can do my best to respond to that as well.","The whole concept of ""natural rights"" is, as Jeremy Bentham described  it, ""nonsense on stilts."" All of our legal rights are social constructs, no more and no less. The fact that they are social constructs does not make them any less meaningful or important. I don't really know why this reality is so discomforting to so many people. Perhaps it's because acknowledging this makes it clear that our rights *can* be taken away, and there is nothing ""above"" or ""beyond"" human society to safeguard them.

what i think is the key is to discuss the the fact that you said ""it's largely your fault"". not ""the causes are attributable to your lifestyle or choices"", or ""you played a significant role in it"", but ""fault"" implying that there's some blame involved, and there's some sort of responsibility to make yourself look more attractive. am i misinterpreting what you were getting at here? because ""it's your fault"" doesn't really feel like neutral phrasing. there definitely feels like some kind of lot of blaming going on here.

This is something i asked myself too and Mr. Sanders has passed my test. Here Ill try and explain why.

&gt;1) I've never seen him not looking generally flustered and awkward. Working on international issues requires developing personal relationships, thus being good at making friends. I don't think he is like that.

This is pretty subjective. How do you mean flustered? He speaks with his hands (he's from Brooklyn), his hair is messy, but please elaborate on why you feel this way because i disagree that he looks flustered or awkward. Hes actual a pretty good orator IMO.

&gt;2) It requires building alliance and persuading people. Bernie is an independent, does not have serious alliances or close friends in Congress despite being there for over two decades. He has not gotten any notable legislation passed. Would he really negotiate the best possible international treaties for the US?

As a (I) senator, he doesn't have the ""party"" alliances a straightforward Dem or Rep would have because hes the *only* Ind in our federal legislative body. As Dem president, this would change as he'd have the entire Dem aisle. That, in conjunction with hes been in Senate and USHOR for 20+ years so he has friends and has worked on bills with other representatives. That, and as president, his negotiations would take on a whole new level of seriousness when dealing internationally. This is a sticky issue for any pres candidate as there's really no ""well ive done this so i can deal internationally"" for them to say (unless they're an former/incumbent POTUS). 

&gt;3) A President needs to be able to understand and navigate everyone's goals. Bernie doesn't seem to try to understand everyone's motivations but rather just gets angry at people who think differently from him. e.g. he says things like ""I'll never understand why some poor people vote republican""

How is that any different then other reps? John Beohner swore to block anything and everything that Obama would try and pass. Strictly from a ""I dont like you"" POV. This is bullshit and he needs to be removed for this  (and other things). Were working on that (I live in Ohio). But regardless, to him, seeing the bush tax cuts and how the republicans love the system that is keeping poor people poor (Trickle Down, cutting social security/ social services, NAFTA/ various other trade deals) its a alright question.

This wasn't **his** event. It was a rally on Social Security, medicare that he was invited to speak at. If you watch the video, you'll see a guy (not Bernie) at the podium talking to the BLM girls. *That* guy was the organizer and Bernie said to him to let them speak. Its not about being a pushover, Its about, if i stop them, i look bad, i if i let them speak, ill look better and considering how he himself was arrested for nonviolent civil disobedience, it would be a little hypocritical for him to stop them. A 20 year old B.S. would probably sympathize with these girls and a 73 year old B.S. is still a civil rights sympathizer.

This is dead wrong. As a House member, he got the most amendments passed as anyone in the Congress. In the Senate he worked with Congressman Ron Paul to audit the Fed. He got a 10 billion dollar provision to increase the number of people community health centers served by 10 million. He worked with John McCain recently to craft the new Veterans Affairs Budget which was one of the most significant pieces of bipartisan legislation negotiated in a dysfunctional Congress.

What makes fiction a better alternative to those activities?","&gt; Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all.

That is unequivocally false. Fiction can be entertaining but its value comes from its ability to help the reader (watcher, listener &amp;c.) grow. Good art will express something the consumer already feels or knows but is unable to describe (how *Hannibal* treats and presents the beautiful and grotesque identically), or force on to the consumer an experience or point-of-view alien to them (like the post-war dissatisfaction and purposelessness of WWI vets as presented in *The Sun Also Rises*), or explore an aspect of life in an allegorical way to highlight certain aspects of it (like how *Alien* is one big giant rape metaphor). All these things can be done in exciting ways but the goal is not excitement. 

These things contribute to the personal growth of the consumer in ways dry non-fiction or unaided introspection cannot. It's one thing to read about Russia's 19th century identity crisis, but another thing entirely to anthropomorphize it and view ideology on such a personal scale (The Brothers Karamazov). It's one thing to think about how charming people can get away with horrible things, but another thing entirely to be drawn in yourself without even realizing it (Lolita). It's one thing to read ""people usually prefer independence to dependence even when there are costs associated with the former"", but another thing entirely to read:

*Here at least*

*we shall be free; the Almighty hath not built*

*Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:*

*Here we may reign secure, and in my choice*

*to reign is worth ambition though in Hell:*

*Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven.*","&gt; Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all.

I think you should define what you mean by ""growing"" here. Do you mean a specific kind of development? If yes, in what direction? What skills should we develop or what form of progress should we pursue instead of enjoying entertainment media?

&gt; Why waste our time trying to entertain ourselves when we could just use other forms of relaxation between sessions of growing ourselves?

Such as? Isn't every form of relaxation ""entertainment"" by definiton?

&gt; Is fiction truly of some use?

I would argue yes: Fiction, despite being fictional, can still be as useful for intellectual stimulation as traditional education. Here are some examples: 

 * Video games like ""This War of mine"" try to offer a perspective of struggling civilians in a war-torn country for those lacking first-hand experience of war.

 * The novel ""Animal Farm"" can convey a basic understanding of political and sociolgical development of capitalistic societies into autocratic dictatorships.

 * Reading classical German poetry, like the famous works of Goethe, can complement a historical education about Central Europe in the 18th and 19th century, as well as giving insight into moral and cultural ideas prevalent during that time.

* Fiction can inspire interest and further reading / investigation into a particular topic - science, historical events, social issues, different cultures/societies, technologies.

* Fiction can allow one to empathize with different perspectives they would have not previously considered or found difficult to wrap their head around. 

* It can assist one to observe and understand the complexity of human emotions and relations.

* In many science studies, they will get the test subjects to consume fiction while they scan their brains to observe how they respond to certain stimuli that would otherwise be unsafe/hard to find within the immediate vicinity = increased understanding of how our noggins work = better medications, better health policies, more effectively directed funding in health industry = overall healthier population... eventually.

**Health**

* Many people cite fiction - music, video games, watching films/tv series, etc as a mental escape that helps them unwind at the end of the day and calm down. 
There is ample info out there that details the negative effects pent up frustration and stress can have on both your mental and physical state.

* It can inspire other people to create their own fiction - music/art/film/write which is also a good stress-reliever.

* Refer to last point under **Knowledge**

**Career Progress/Social life**
 
* Consuming fiction can inspire one to take up creating it themselves and some make a career out of it. Movie stars/directors, artists and musicians didn't decide to be those things in a vacuum. I think you'll find most were inspired by consuming fiction beforehand.

* Many people will be inclined, after consumption, to take it up as a hobby = join community groups/forums, take classes etc = new friends - if you don't think making new friends can help one grow as an individual then I don't know what will.

Treating someone *better* because of their race is just as racist.

More fundamentally one's treatment of others is secondary to the belief that causes that treatment. To be a racist all you need is to believe that individual behaviour and moral character is predetermined by your racial genetics. Racism is a belief, a form of genetic determinism.","Ok the entire discussion here rests upon what you mean by ""racism"". If racism is simply as you define then there is no discussion, you would be right.  Here are some points I would need cleared up before I can comment:

""The only factor at play when determining racism should be if someone is treating someone""- Can institutions and cultures be racist? Are they the ""someone"" in question? 
""because of their race or ethnicity""-How do you know when this criterion is met? Remember that behaviours are not necessarily reflective of the behaviour you're looking for. This seems to result in very few actual incidents of racism.
""race or ethnicity""- Is race is even a coherent concept? If it isn't then can someone be a racist if they don't believe in race?

"1. Military industry keeps some of the very few manufacturing jobs in US, this industry's survival critically depends on US's defence policies and government orders, without US spending sizeable chunk of its budget on military, millions of jobs will be lost.

2. US has the money. Yes, US is in some serious debt right now, however USD is the most indestructible currency ever existed in human history, with US's economy size, gold reserve and military power at its back, it is impossible for USD to collapse in the foreseeable future. US can always borrow more money from its own citizen or foreign countries without worrying about crisis like Greece happen. Further more, even if USD value drops as a consequence of US printing more cash to pay back debts, all other countries will follow to de-value their currencies to compete with US, just like we have seen in the past few years.

3. US spending more on military doesn't necessary mean a safer world, but at least it will make its NATO allies safer. As a Canadian I know we don't have to worry about fighting off an invasion alone. US spending more on defence means we will spend less, this will benefit our economy and allow us to put more money into our welfare system.
 
4. No matter how much US government sets its 'defence' budget,  US's armed force is built to be an offence force. Considering how the military complex works and US politician/public thinks, US will never stop bombing/invading smaller countries to defend its 'freedom'. Spending more money developing and ensuring US's technological advantage on military means less casualties from those inevitable wars.

5. Military technologies benefits civilian life in the long run. We wouldn't get internet, GPS, jumble jets and spacecraft if US haven't thrown so much money into military. I want to see human land on Mars before I am 50, so come on US congress, make it happen!

Edit:

To answer some of the most frequent questions:

**Why not spend the money on infrastructure/medical research/education/NASA?**

Well, when US was cutting military spending in the 90s, the federal spending on education/infrastructure/NASA/higher education research also went down. I fundamentally disagree the argument that 'we are not spending enough on such/such/such because we spend too much on military!' The fact is the amount we spend on military and other programs is not a zero sum game. Spending less on military dose not bring US better infrastructure/education/research. 

**US is already spending too much on military, it's by far the most powerful force in the world, why more?**

In % per GDP sense, US ranked No.21 in the world(3.5%), behind Saudi Arabia (10.8%), Israel (5.2%) and Russia (4.5%), this is not that much. Comparing to those countries and the collapsed USSR, US is in a much better financial state (see my point 2).

Also, US government and public have set their military force to be the keeper of freedom/world police ever since the end of WWII. Yes the current size of US military is too big for a defensive force. However, for what US public and government want it to be? I think the current spending is well justified if not insufficient.","So I feel like this is a joke but I can't really tell. Here goes

First, pretty much everything you're saying cal already be accomplished by maintaining our extremely high military funding. Here's a point by point response:

1. Sure, but it also creates the military industrial complex. It  creates an incentive to go to war because it's profitable. Killing your own people and other people because you can make money is kinda a bad thing. The US can create jobs plenty of other ways: build infrastructure, invest in green energy, etc. and all of those are pretty harm-free

2. Okay? But we already have a [noticeably stronger military](http://pgpf.org/Chart-Archive/0053_defense-comparison) than anyone else. Just because we *can* spend the money doesn't mean we *should* when it can be spent on [much better things](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21605932-country-where-everyone-drives-america-has-shoddy-roads-bridging-gap)

3. No, it means we go to war more. Which means we draw NATO allies into war. And we already have a military strong enough to protect our allies. Who in NATO is under any sort of threat right now?

4. How about we just don't go to war in those cases? Increased spending at least makes it more likely that we go to useless wars

5. So fund research, not military research.","You have some arguments for why the US should spend more money in general, and other ones why spending on the military is better.  

1. I think there better ways to support manufacturing jobs than just military spending.  Instead of building a 12th aircraft carrier, the US could spend that money manufacturing more buses or trains to improve US infrastructure.  This also could improve the economy and the quality of life of many Americans by making transportation better and easier.

2. This is an argument for spending money in general, not necessarily on military spending.  The US is concerned about long term debt, and is actively cutting funding from plenty of other programs.  To some extent, there is a limit to what is spent total by the government, and so more military spending inevitably will mean less spending on other programs.  

3. Most Americans will not be terribly motivated to think that their additional military spending will lead to Canadians having richer social programs, especially if it comes with cuts to American social programs.  Additionally, the US military is already overwhelming strong, and more or less spending probably wouldn't impact strength in any meaningful way.  The US spends approximately as much on its military as the rest of the world.  Most of the other top spending countries are allies of the US.  
4. There are ways to continue high R&amp;D budgets in the military without spending as much.  About $300 billion/~$700 billion of the annually spent military budget is on pay and benefits for soldiers. That means that the US Militiary will spend more in wages and benefits in 2015 than the Canadian government will spend **in total** in 2015.  One of the big reasons for this is that the US military has hundred of thousands of soldiers stationed overseas, including about 60,000 in Germany and 30,000 in Japan, where troops have been stationed since the end of WWII.  
5. The military isn't the only program the US can spend money on.  They can support NASA, scientific grants, etc, many of which would provide a much better bang for the buck in terms of scientific achievement.",-0.7,-0.7,B,A,False,"Before: 80

It's a sideshow, a distraction. The alternative would be these men sitting around, waiting for something to need destroying. We don't keep our military around and spend billions of dollars for disaster relief. We keep them around to kill people and break things. That's their real purpose, simple as that.

The (legitimate*) purpose of the military is and has always been to defend the public from foreign threats. Now, you're right that the most normal way to do that is to kill people and break things. Killing the damned Nazi that tried to take my house or breaking the tank he's driving is a perfectly reasonable way to protect people from a big foreign threat that manifests in a simple way, often in a uniform or within defined borders.
But those sorts of threats aren't very common any more, are they? Modern threats are a good deal less complicated.

Take Vietnam^. The military tried their standard kill-people-break-stuff routine. In fact, they did it way better than they've ever done it before. How'd that go? Did it mitigate the supposed threat from the NVA? Nup.

And most modern tasks for the defence force are like that. Aside from China, which is deterred by MAD, all of America's threats, from Al Qaeda to African civil war, are unconventional. That means the US military needs to adopt a more sophisticated approach than Mike Huckabee is capable of understanding with his pea brain. This might be something like counter-insurgency, perhaps. These would involve much more than mere violence. EG, in Afghanistan the strategy is clear and build - political science is just as important as violence!

This is why people make fun of Mike Huckabee: he's too stupid or dishonest to be capable of understanding complex things like basic strategy.

*The military can also be used for a bunch of other things, like invading and toppling democracies as a welfare handout to American big business.

^Whether or not Vietnam was a real threat is immaterial. That's a decision for the politicians.","This is becoming increasingly one part of many facets of the military.  Today, we spend an extraordinary amount of time trying to combat terrorism in its many forms across the world.  Sure, if you're engaging in counterinsurgency strategy, killing people and breaking things so your desired faction gets an advantage is one method you can employ. It's a quick surge (no, not necessarily *that* surge) of military power to tip the scales, giving your preferred ""team"" the advantage.

If you're adopting or transitioning to a counterterrorism strategy, however, this will often involve outreach to the local population and its leaders; providing security; offering resources such as food and clothing, and; generally trying to create conditions that will lower the fear factor of local populations caving to terrorists and heighten the personal investment in building up local communities.

We found this out the hard way during the early stages of Iraq, obliterating the enemy but also obliterating civilians and their homes as well.  Even ignoring humanitarian outcries, this makes it far easier for terrorists to make physical incursions since local populations are vulnerable and scared, and thus more likely to acquiesce to their demands.  It makes it easier for ""emotional"" incursions, because you have a whole generation sympathetic to parties who are going to kill the people and break the things that killed their families and broke their things.

In contrast, we saw way more gains when our military began taking up a police function.  It still had traditional military characteristics, including the realistic ability and legal authority to kill and break things when necessary, but it also adopted a more security/rebuilding role, trying to keep streets safe for people and commerce while providing training, building and resources.

If I wanted to explore the issue further, I'd go so far as to say the best anti-terrorism strategy is going to strongly resemble a nation-building strategy.  It takes time and dedication that most leaders of democratic nations won't be able to muster for the long haul, but that's neither here nor there.  The fact remains that modern military hurdles have expanded beyond showing up on a physical field of battle and trying to outgun the other guys -- which, if we're being honest, is a *vast* oversimplification of historical warfare, and is yet another reason to be skeptical of Huckabee's military acumen.  It's choice phrasing designed to be blunt and appeal to folks who view the military as a cosmetic addition to America's display of strength.  It's not an accurate framing of any military's role, particularly not one like ours that is contributing to such a wide spectrum of international causes, even if we're ultimately there in some form for our (proactive) defense.",-0.7,-0.35,B,B,True,"Before: 90

The flaw in your position that I see is [issue salience](http://sppc2014.indiana.edu/Papers/Bromley-Trujillo%20et%20al.pdf). People care about certain issues more than others and give greater weight to those when comparing candidates. If social issues don't feature prominently in an election, i.e., we talked about the economy, foreign policy, energy policy, etc., voters are likely to make their decision on other issues and choose a candidate who they disagreed with on social issues. The state of the economy is of far greater concern to most voters than marijuana legalization for example. Abortion tends to be the biggest exception to this, since most people tend to have strong views on the subject and for many voters it is a must-agree issue.  

Republicans can in my view definitely win another election. A 2% swing nationally would have won Romney the election. If the any of the elements of the Obama coalition don't show up in the future, than the necessary swing is even smaller.","Wait, you are young, college educated, bisexual, female, and atheist. Before you ask us why you don't think another republican can win, you should really take a look at yourself first. You've likely surrounded yourself in an echo chamber.

I present 2 reasons why the Republicans are still going strong:

1) Young people don't vote. The showing for elections is pitiful, but especially among young people. And demographics show that the older you get, the more likely you are to vote. This is even more evident when the elections get smaller - when was the last time you voted for city commissioner? Probably never. But your grandma has in the past 5 elections.

2) Some people don't care about those things, and care about other things instead. The most obvious example is economics. Conservatives favor policies which are more favorable to business and economic growth than liberals. They support lower taxes, less regulation, and fewer worker's rights. If you are involved in running a business, or realize that you might lose your job (even your shitty, underpaid job) if your business loses its competitive edge, you will care far more about keeping the economy going strong than whether or not two men can get married in Nevada.",-0.35,-0.35,B,A,False,"Before: 90

Republicans are smart &amp; focused about targeting competitive areas and maximizing every possible systemic advantage they can muster (voter suppression, redistricting, controlling local establishment, big dollar advertising) and tend to have more consistent voter turn out (the elderly and angry white people).

The Democrats voter turnout is more inconsistent though, as they tend to rely on groups that only get out and vote when really excited (the young, economically disadvantaged).

It's really up to the Democrats if they want to win or lose a presidential election.  We've seen *exactly* what happens when they think the Republican can't win: they get complacent and nominate a boring establishment candidate that fails to energize their flakier base, and they fuck it up.  See Al Gore &amp; John Kerry.

That's why the seemingly inevitable Hillary nomination scares me.  No one is excited about Hillary.  It's the boring conservative choice that repeatedly loses the Democrats elections.

If only Elizabeth Warren were running.  She's the new brightest star in the party, and has the ability to run the formula that worked well for Clinton and Obama.","John Kasich and a Marco Rubio ticket would be a near 100% victory both are popular in their home states John Kasich has a 64% approval rate in Ohio and Rubio Has a 56% approval ratting in Flordia.


Remember the last old white guy to won the Presendency was Carter in 76, Bill Clinton won the Youth and middle vote due to his young charm and ability to handle a room and a lot of miniroties got out to vote, because they thought he's diffrent and can bring change even his unoffical motto was ""The first Black Presdient"".
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuQgWtRIoNQ)

Look at the 2000 and 2004 election where the Democrats had an old white guy they lost, but in 2008 and 2012 they had Obama running and he won due to record black and hispanic turn-out, then in the congrestional elections of 2010/2014 they lost big time when.


Why do you think that The DNC is puching for Hiliary over Biden even though Biden has higher approval rattings? Because, on election day they want more women to show up.

"So, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But I think that if we were to put a place a law mandating employers to give paid maternity leave, it would result in unfair hiring biases against women. Some employers would develop a preference for hiring men over women because, if you are purely concerned with profit as lots of employers are, why take the risk of hiring a lady who might take a lot of time from work while you can just not risk it and hire a man? There are already a lot of stereotypes about women being less dedicated to their jobs than men because they are ""more focused on kids"". Wouldn't a mandatory maternity leave just make this worse? 

It's particularly unfair to women who aren't planning on having kids because employers could be biased against them for expecting them to use something they won't ever even need in the first place!

If paternity leave were also mandated, then this would be less of a problem because men would be as likely (or nearly as likely) to take leave as well, making the ""expected value"" of a man's labor to an employer the same as a woman's, and hopefully eliminating the bias.

There's not much way around it. In the event where the government pays most of the salary while on leave, I don't think hiring practice would change much. 

Secondly, I agree that paid paternity leave should also be an option in the event of a mandatory paid maternity leave, if only for the sake of equality. However, I don't think this will change the current hiring practices, simply because I believe males will be less likely to take these leaves than women.","While perhaps in a world where everyone made decisions based on pure rational thinking, this might be true, I don't think this would be an issue in the real world, for two main reasons (both of which are based in current popular perceptions):

1.  As /u/Madplato mentioned, employers are often already biased against hiring women because of the perception that they will probably get pregnant at some point and take off from work.  I don't think requiring employers to pay for the maternity leave would much affect this perception, because I doubt employers will seriously think women who otherwise wouldn't have gotten pregnant and taken time off anyway will now decide to do so just for a few months' pay.  This negative perception of women already unfairly affects women who don't intend to have children.

2.  Employers often already have a perception that men will be more dedicated workers, whether or not you have paid maternity leave, or paid leave for both parents; there's an expectation that men will take less time off for any family-related reason than women.  So I think even if a law requiring paid maternity leave did harm women, adding paid paternity leave wouldn't fix that, because the underlying assumptions about men and women wouldn't change.

Finally, I would say that even taking into account a small chance that employers will discriminate against women more if required to pay for maternity leave, it would still do more good than harm to women workers on the whole.  Not being able to take any time off work to recover from pregnancy and spend quality time with your baby can be a huge source of pressure for women, and can force women to put off having children until later than they would want.  All of these factors harm women.",-0.35,0.7,B,B,True,"Before: 70

"Adult tickets cost more than child's tickets for anything that distinguishes the two and often this makes sense. Adults have more money than kids and can afford the higher prices. Kids pricing allows family's to be able to afford to go to things as a family. For certain things, size does matter (fuel costs for transportation) and most adults are bigger than most kids and so should get charged more. And specific to theaters, adults are more likely to see an R rated and since the R-ratings are somewhat prohibitive in terms of selling tickets, I could see some sort of roundabout justification for increasing tickets prices for adults as they are likely to see a movie that falls into this mildly ""niche"" category of movies. 

I think the problem I have is that most (if not all movie theaters) consider you and adult at thirteen or fourteen. This doesn't make any sense. A thirteen year old doesn't have much more money does a twelve year old. They don't even have the right to work for another few years. They're not much bigger than a twelve year old and even if they were it wouldn't really matter because its not like bigger movie goes are more costly than a small movie goer. They can't see rated R movies. It seems like the only ""right"" they've acquired is to technically see a PG-13 movie but they probably could do that before age thirteen and it hardly seems to justify a price increase. I know that thirteen is not universal but I find it wrong to charge adult prices for anyone under eighteen (you could maybe argue seventeen since they can see rated R movies and can work).

If a parent is going to take their kids somewhere, cost will certainly be a factor. If they have to pay full price for multiple tickets than it might make them choose somewhere else to go. By giving a discount for young kids they attract more business from parents. 13 or so is about the age kids start going to movies with friends instead of their parents. Sure they are still borrowing money from their parents, but now the few extra dollars for a ticket isn't as big of a deal since they are only paying for one ticket instead of 2 or 3 or however many kids they might have.","There are three justifications for the price differences for children under 13. 

First, teenagers and young adults attend the movies more often than any other demographic. That group is over represented - People from 12-18 represent only 8% of the population but represent 16% of the movie going audience and 18 to 24 year olds represent 19% of the audience but just 10% of the population.  However, children under 12 are underrepresented - they make up just 7% of the typical movie going audience while being 14% of the population. (By the way, these stats are from 2010 since I couldn't find anything more recent).  The only other group that is significantly underrepresented are seniors. 
So the theater industry offers discounts to those underrepresented groups needs to incentivize them to attend. Thus, we regularly see discounts for senior &amp; children 12 and under at movie theaters.   However, since teenagers are showing up in numbers already, it doesn't make sense to target them with a discount. You want them paying full price.  

Second , as was mentioned above, is that a lower child price targets families. It's essentially making attending the movies as a family less expensive and thus more attractive option.  Other groups - a pack of teenagers for example - are less likely to consider the total cost for the group since they will be paying for their tickets individually. However,  families are going to be very aware of the total cost since they will not be paying individually.  And, they will be comparing that total cost against other entertainment options. So a teenager might be asking ""is it worth $15 bucks to see this movie with my friends"" while a family of four  is asking ""is $60 worth it to see this movie.""  Once you start considering that total cost, it may not sound like much of s value. So, theaters improving that value proposition with a discount makes sense. 

Finally, I'd argue that in general the younger a person is, the less they get out of a movie. Now, that's not true for all movies. But, if a parent is considering attending let's say a typical drama, I think you would conclude that your 11 year old might not appreciate or understand that movie well enough to justify the $15 a full priced ticket will cost.  That is not to say the child won't get any enjoyment out of that movie, but a lower price might convince a parent to bring a child that they wouldn't for full price. Also, and I think more importantly, that parent might not attend that movie unless they can take their child (think single or stay at home parents, or just those unwilling to attend the movies without their children).  Now, like a said, I don't think this is true for every movie, but for certain movies a discounted child ticket price can be justified by young children being less able to appreciate those movies.",-0.7,-0.7,B,B,True,"Before: 70

"Growing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. While fear of extermination would indeed be justified in 1930s Europe, fear of extermination by Islamic terrorists continues today even in Canada and the US. I've even heard that ISIS is going to exterminate the Jews, even though ISIS has not killed a single Jewish person to this date.

There is a widely-held view in Jewish circles that the UN is inherently anti-Semitic even though the majority of permanent members of the UN Security Council are very pro-Israel. UN troops never interfere with Israeli military operations and one of the first UN resolutions was the establishment of the State of Israel. Still, extremist groups like the JDL (Jewish Defence League) attract support from mainstream Jewish organizations, despite their classification as a terrorist group.

The Jewish community seems to think that their politicians at home persecute them as well. I know so many liberal Jews who will vote for a right-wing party just because they scream their unwavering support for Israel the loudest. Currently, every single major candidate running for President of the United States or Prime Minister of Canada has declared their staunch support for Israel; even left-wingers like Bernie Sanders and Canada's frontrunner Tom Mulcair.

Meanwhile, white cops are killing black kids at a horrifying rate but the Jewish community is still focused on their own supposed persecution. When the Charleston shooting broke out, my synagogue had one moment of silence then continued with its Israel fundraiser. My theory is that North American Jewish culture has developed an irrational persecution complex due to past persecution ritualistically retold every Hanukkah, Passover, Purim, Yom Ha'Shoah, etc. I realize this may come off as anti-Semetic and indeed my own family has called me a ""self-hating Jew"", although I think this only reinforces my point. Will someone change my view?","You have to remember that many Jews alive today were actively persecuted and discriminated against in North America. By chance I just just finished reading an article about Jon Stewart where he describes being bullied for his religion as a child. Clubs still excluded Jewish members and Jews were still treated as very much separate from the rest of society. People who grew up in the 50s, 60s and 70s still faced a fair amount of discrimination as children and younger adults and it's not unreasonable to be affected by that. That makes feelings of persecution entirely rational.","You've developed a theory based on your own family and community, and anecdotes from some national figures and events. But the question is, does the theory represent the majority of North American Jews.

In my experience it does not, and I also see plenty of national figures that support my position, such as for example [Chomky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky#Political_views), Jon Stewart, [Schulman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Schulman#Activism), etc.; Jews are very active in the BDS movement; and there is of course [J Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Street) and so forth.

Why is your experience different from mine? Well, you mentioned ""my synagogue."" It is very possible that your theory is right about more religious Jews, but a lot of Jews in the US are non-religious and never or almost never go to a synagogue. They are also much less supportive of Israel and far less likely to think Jews are persecuted.

You might be right that the Jewish **religion** focuses a lot on persecution of Jews (which makes sense, it's how Jews survived), but it simply is [not a big factor in the lives of many or most Jews in North America today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews#Observances_and_engagement): Even of Jews that consider themselves ""strongly connected"" to the Jewish religion, less than half belong to a synagogue.

"Having played dota for 1 year, and Lol for 6 months before that i have come to the opinion that Dota 2 is a much better game in many facets. Not only is dota 2 completely free to play, the actual gameplay is better, and the graphics are much better.


-The Dota 2 map is larger and has more interesting features for vision and juking.


-Dota 2 has TP scrolls and a courier allowing for more interesting map movement.


-Dota 2 heroes have much more unique and scaled up abillities than LoL Champions.  Think techies vs teemo, and heroes like tinker, meepo, lone druid, invoker, etc.  LoL heroes typically have a couple skillshot nukes and a movement abillity as a rule of thumb.


-Denying, highground miss chance, and pulling/stacking make laning much more interesting in Dota.


-Ancients and Roshan are much more interesting high value targets than Dragon or Baron.


-Towers are much weaker in Dota, and smoke of deceit exists, allowing for much more aggressive gameplay.


-Dota heros are much more turbocharged, any dota hero ported exactly would be the strongest champion in League of Legends.


-Activatable items improve gameplay decisionmaking.  LoL items are boring and mostly just stat based.  Dota items allow for much more customizablility in item build and improvement in game play (blink dagger 18 second cooldown vs. flash 300 second cooldown).


Dota 2 has a higher barrier of entry in a style of game whose focus is improvement, and that might lead people to LoL, but given the massive time investment in either game this is basically irrelevent.

The superior game offers more meaningful options to a player at all periods of the game. A false option, a calculation or a forgone outcome are not fun.

DotA2 is a strategic game. Everything you do has weight, but you do not get to do much. For example, hero choice is a big choice, but once made, you do not get to do anything about lane matchup, thats a forgone conclusion of the matchup. Your powercurve has been decided. Fights have long CC, and many targeted abilities: You will get hit with stuff, and the timing of these big things is strategic, but really, there is no choices.

LoL is tactical. Most things you do have little weight but there are many options. Almost any hero is playable into any other hero. Builds allow many different options and power curves. Fights are fluid and skillful with skillshots to dodge and many decisions as to targets and timing of spell use.

I can take your points one by one and show you how this works:

1. The map is larger with less vision to make your choice where to go a more impactful one, but the longer distance means you cannot make destination choices often or you will lose time. LoL's smaller map means your position is more tactical, and allows people to redeploy faster.

2. Courier attacks are highly strategic, but leave players with no choices. LoL's recalls give lots of choices, and while most of them only lead to a small gold advantage gained, good players can abuse recall timing to get significantly more farm.

3. You have bigger skills and more unique heroes, which means choice is strategic, but it also means that what you do in fights has been predetermined and you only have a calculation of who to click on to do. Champions with more closely related skill push both players to try attain their perfect play, while denying the opponent something similar, many more tactical choices.

4. The laning mechanics are literally tacked on because without them it would be dull. Heroes have strategic spell casts with massive mana costs, meaning you can make big decisions very infreqently. Thus, to fill time and stop bored players, denying and miss had to be added. LoL lets you cast often, and while each cast is less impactful, it leads to many tactical choices in lane, with spell harass and use being the main point.

5. Roshan is definately a boring objective, granting nothing more than gold and a extra life. Anchient camps are even worse, they only give gold. Dragon gives a stacking buff which forces people to consider the value of each dragon in the context of the unlocked lategame buff. Baron gives a buff which basically makes it impossible to defend against sieges by empowering minions, much more interesting.

6. While DotA heroes are very strong, they are very perscriptive in how they have to be played, offering few choices to the player and even fewer in a matchup. By having more similar champions, interactions are more even and offer many more choices.

7. Active items are simply one extra calculation: ""When is it best for me to use this"" with there being a single best time. Cooldowns are not long enough to make this a unclear decision, and so, in both games, they simply form another button to press.

DotA2 is a harder game, because you must have massive strategic knowledge to play it at any level. You must know matchups, power curves etc etc due to the few choices you can make having high impact. LoL is a easier to start game, as you have many choices to make, which do not have individual large impact. The tactical nature limits the required information starting out, allowing people to  grasp it easily.

DotA2 is not a bad game, rather it is simply a complex game with many mechanics which require a deep knowledge and for this reason it can be said to limit the choices a player can make and this is something a lot of people dislike, leading to the playerbase discrepancy.

LoL is simply superior, more people play it, and the game actively encourages making meaningful choices, the crucial fun in a game.","As someone with 3k+ games of League under his belt and three years of DotA Allstars experience, I think you can pretty easily narrow down your argument to ""complex games are better"". 

But that's not true in all situations, and my current circle of gaming friends is a perfect example. Not one out or the ten of them us willing to even touch DotA because of its complexity, primarily because they're really not good at video games. 

For people who enjoy difficult games with high skill ceilings, DotA is certainly superior - but your claim is missing that bit of context, because not everyone enjoys difficult games, and not everyone aspires to have a high skill level. 

That last part in particular is a point I'm personally trying to come to grips with, but it's apparently the primary mode my friends have - they just want to play to have fun, not to get good; and at all opportunities they will choose having fun over being good. Thus, league is perfect for them - nanda DotA is nothing short of cancer.

"To be honest, I'm not sure I completely believe in the title opinion statement. The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. Currently, the migrant crisis is one of the biggest items of concern for Europeans. Most Europeans say, with much accuracy, that the migrant stream has to be shut off because a) immigrants are a weight on the economy, and b) most migrants refuse to assimilate, creating a lot of social problems. However, I still feel like they have to own up to that problem. Western societies historically engaged in colonialism and imperialism and profited over it so much, that they achieved wealth that continues to earn their country the status of ""developed/first-world."" Often times when they did this, they ended up creating conditions in the colonized country that would be unfavorable to their future development. I know most Europeans/Americans would respond to this by saying ""I had nothing to do with this, why should I take responsibility over the past?"" but I find that to be a really weak argument. If my grandfather robbed somebody of something, died, and passed the stolen goods/money down to me, don't I have a moral obligation to return the stolen items, even if I had nothing to do with the crime? I think I would. Maybe the main problem with my view is that it is purely moral, and not legal/practical. But letting poor people work out the problems that are partly as a result of your people's past seems very selfish to me.

"This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions, merely an observation i have come to.

The widespread belief or following of most organized religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism) is a sign of human weakness in a couple of ways. 

The need for an afterlife in most religions satisfies our general fears of death, and the impermanence and futility of our lives. The theory isn't backed by much scientific evidence as far as i know, so the reason to believe in an afterlife isn't that it makes more sense but that it makes life easier. A fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that i would categorize as fairytale. This is what i would call a weakness. 

The need for moral guidance in life - to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong. Furthermore, the need of a consequence by eternal damnation as persuasion not to do ""bad things"", and the need of an incentive by eternal salvation to do good. Is a sign of weakness in that it shows that human-nature is bad, or barbaric in a sense.


EDIT: Keep the comments coming guys - ""i'll secede on that point - ""moral guidance"" is not evidence for human weakness. But a motivation to believe in a creator.""

That's incorrect. Humans have a limited attention span. Making things easier allows you to better focus on important tasks.

&gt;The need for moral guidance in life - to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong.

So here you're saying artificially produced reward and punishment schemes are unhelpful and demonstrate barbaric behaviour?

Also incorrect, humans are rational intelligent beings and it's fairly normal for them to create artificial incentive structures to aid proper behaviour, like golden stars for doing well at class, or setting artificial goals like having a bookshelf of a favorite author.

None of your stated weaknesses are actual weaknesses. There are religious groups with genuine weaknesses like jehovah's witnesses who refuse to take blood transplants, or the Hindu practice of followers of the Vishnu Smriti burning widows, but vague non weaknesses don't mean much. If a weakness leads to physical harm then it's a bit more serious, but vague emotional ones mean little.

There are many practices of religious people that humans in general do. Religious people speak. This isn't a sign of their weakness at nonverbal communication. Religious people exercise. This isn't a sign they are wasting calories. Religious people read. This isn't a sign of their lack of sociability.

When something is dismissed as anecdotal, it's usually because there's better evidence available. No one complains that it's anecdotal when you say you enjoy chocolate cake.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking anecdotal evidence into consideration, especially in a circumstance like asking someone you know their experience and opinion regarding a product that you are considering buying. There is absolutely valuable information that can be taken from anecdotal evidence.

The problem is when you come to an actual conclusion based on anecdotal evidence alone. We cannot logically come to any conclusions on something based on one observation. There is nothing to say that the results obtained were not outliers, or that they cannot be explained by something other than what we are looking at.

So, you aren't wrong in saying that we should not dismiss something because of anecdotal evidence, but if we are hoping to form a well thought out opinion on something, we really should require more than anecdotal evidence alone.

Most importantly, it should not be used to dismiss evidence that has been gathered scientifically, through numerous observations. There are exceptions to every rule, and we can't go around denying established rules or truths because we know of an exception. Your high functioning meth smoking cousin does not disprove the idea that meth is a destructive drug.

Now, that isn't to say that someone who wants to truly understand the effects of a drug like meth shouldn't take these individual cases into consideration, and attempt to understand what makes someone like your cousin (in this hypothetical case, obviously) able to function while most others cannot.

"This view of mine might sound obvious or simple but I think a lot of sensitive, complex social issues have simple underlying causes that are often ignored. In fact, I think they are so often ignored that I start to doubt my own view, hence this post. I'm a little embarrassed to share it. Here's my basic line of thought:

* Stereotypes exist because the generalization is accurate.
* Several of society's popular problems are blamed on other people acting with an awareness of stereotypes, or the stereotypes themselves.
* A lot of cases regarding these problems are caused or made worse by the victim acting in accordance with a stereotype while blaming either the stereotype or something else.
* If people made more of a conscious effort to not act in accordance with a stereotype in a situation where the stereotype could be considered relevant less incidents would occur.
* When less incidents occur the stereotype changes or evaporates completely. 

'Victim' is somewhat of a loose term here (I'm excluding people who are indirectly involved with an incident pertaining to whatever social ill anyone might refer to) so before you shout ""victim blaming!"" I'll freely state that yes, I believe victims are *very rarely* 100% free from some kind of responsibility. 

An example would be a black man being pulled over in a bad neighborhood and getting ticketed, arrested, or worse after arguing with/ resisting the police officer. We *might* be able to argue the man was unfairly profiled, but we can't prove something like that. It's much easier to take preventative measures (respect and compliance with the officer, no matter how shitty of a person they may be) and either avoid the situation completely or not make it harder than it needs to be. But once the black driver starts getting loud and upset, in the cops mind he's just another loud black person (fulfilling the stereotype) which could lead the officer to believe that the driver fulfills other aspects of his stereotype. 

Another quick example would be the stereotype of men only being interested in sex and men saying ""not all men are pigs."" Well, if that stereotype upsets you as a man, the only thing you can really do that will have any kind of effect is to not be a pig! But nobody seems to realize this, they just want everyone else to do what they ask. 

Obviously I'm not proposing an over-night fix to any social issue, but what I'm proposing would benefit our society a lot more than victims telling everyone else to stop stereotyping. Pointing the finger at the aggressor(s) doesn't actually help solve the whole problem; all that does is either end that individual incident or piss people off. That shortsightedness does absolutely nothing to solve the problem on any kind of large, lasting scale. 

I'm happy to edit for any needed clarification.

"Basically, me and my girlfriend disagree on whether smacking is ever acceptable, so I'm coming here to see if I can have my view changed. 

I believe that in a situation where, having attempted to use more reasoned methods of discipline or persuasion, a child is still behaving badly/doing something they shouldn't then there is nothing wrong with smacking them, as long as it's not in a way that causes genuine unreasonable pain. I view it more as a symbolic method of demonstrating that they've done something wrong. 

I am more than happy to have my view changed on this, and I'd actually probably prefer to change my mind! Thanks.

The only way to guarantee a kid won't do something again is if they become aware of the feelings of others and *why* what they did was bad.,"There's evidence that shows that spanking, and corporal punishment in general, is related to slower cognitive development of children. [This study](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=250684) shows that those children who were not spanked gained over 5 more points (on a 100-point scale) compared with those children who were spanked.

That's not all, of course. It's known that children who are spanked and harshly disciplined are more likely to show signs of anxiety and depressive symptoms.

But let's move away from the studies for a moment. You should certainly read [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/moral-landscapes/201309/research-spanking-it-s-bad-all-kids) from Psychology Today that talks about the issue in detail. Spanking is bad in many ways: It decreases the level of trust that a child feels for a parent, it doesn't increase desirable behaviour, and this is true regardless of ethnicity or culture.

"People talk about 'natural' or 'God-given rights', but all rights can be taken from you. If rights like ""free speech"" or ""free association"" are 'inalienable', 'natural', or 'God-given', how come so many people don't have them. ""Rights"" are created by the state, on their terms.

I hear alot of people claiming ""The right to free speech"", or ""The right to the pursuit of happiness"". Looking at the world in these terms is false, misleading and detrimental to society. No rights are absolute- the world would be screwed if they were. Laws about inciting violence, truth in advertising, libel, slander, pornography, threats, extortion, racial vilification, sexual harassment, tax fraud and many, many more, all limit free speech, but are vital for society. 
Can I ""pursue happiness"" by running over the elderly in my F150, or selling crack to toddlers? But I got the ""right""!! right? All 'rights' have limits. Looking at things purely in terms of ""rights""
creates a selfish, narcissistic, entitled, unreasonable mindset.

Rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin, but there's no ""Bill of Responsibilities"". Talking about 'Rights' like this
makes people think they can do what they want, coz ""I got Rights!!"". 

Rights are a myth, and we need a better model for thinking about personal freedom.
_____","Former civics teacher here. Regarding your statement that 

&gt; Rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin, but there's no ""Bill of Responsibilities""

and the implication that we need to refer more to responsibilities of citizenship, I agree 100%. There is a sense of entitlement among American citizens today; I can't say if it's existed in other epochs, but it does seem to have a deleterious effect on our political discourse, and on civil society more generally.

That said, the notion that

&gt; Rights are a myth

and

&gt; 'Rights' are not a real thing. They exist only as much as the state allows

is a dangerous one. The notion of limited government, i.e. a government created of, by, and for the people, which can only create new laws within the framework of a constitution, exists to protect citizens from the excesses of unchecked government power. The companion notion of natural rights is necessary for the conception of limited government. If, as you claim, rights come *from the government*, what stops government from switching things up and determining that, for example, we don't have a right to due process? (Some would argue that this is already happening, but I'll get to that in a moment.) That we don't have a right to the proceeds of our labor? What if the President decided that he needed a new palace, that term limits--hell, even those pesky elections--aren't really necessary, and so he upped the tax rate to near 100% and declared himself emperor? Historically, all a ruler needs is the support of the elites and the military to make that happen. A generally-accepted belief in limited government and natural rights doesn't inherently prevent these abuses, but it's a very good first step. (It's especially a good step because the members of the military, who generally aren't the elites, will have been conditioned to believe in limited government just as they have been conditioned to follow strict lines of authority, so they're less likely to quietly sign on to a power grab by a rogue President.)

As to your point below that 

&gt; 'rights' aren't about compromise; they're about entitlement

this is patently false. Rights will necessarily conflict. There are very few moral systems that argue that there are not overlaps in rights, where priority must be given to some over others. (Modern American libertarians would make the argument that the Non-Aggression Principle is a single rule to determine all disputes, but this is problematic in its own right; for example, it allows for the extreme interpretation that my current self cannot 'enslave' my future self by signing contracts, making the entire institution of binding agreements null and void. I think that any moral system with this level of ""clarity"" necessarily tends toward allowing absurdity like this, if not actively encouraging it.) This is the reason we require a (preferably impartial) judiciary: to determine the precedence and priority of various rights. For example, in the most famous example, my 1st Amendment right to yell ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater has been deemed, rightfully, to be trumped by society's collective right not to have its citizens deliberately cause physical harm to others. (You could very easily frame that collective right as my responsibility not to cause physical harm to others, and I would agree with it.)

But wait, you say, that's **government** determining rights! You're [I am] wrong! Rights *do* come from government!

Well, not quite. As a civil society, we need some arbiter that we can all appeal to when our rights come into conflict. Since government has existed seemingly since time immemorial, we have attempted to harness its power to that end. And that's all government is, a way of aggregating power. We like to think that it represents and protects all of us, but government is very easily captured by people who have disproportionate power or wealth to begin with, making it a dangerous tool. Yes, we need government (or some other collectively agreeable arbiter) to decide questions of *whose rights or responsibilities win out in a conflict*, but that doesn't mean the rights in question came from government in the first place. Just because a corrupt government chooses not to protect a set of rights, or actively chooses to violate them (as many police forces seem to be ignoring our 4th Amendment rights, especially in seeking out citizens with drugs), **does not** mean that we didn't have that right to begin with. It is a precondition for challenging the government to the extent necessary to restore the rights. If, as you say, rights *come from government*, then we should ignore public outrage about the TSA, about the War on Drugs, about Ferguson and Baltimore and the myriad places where cops kill people of color, because those are all instances of government agents acting against private citizens. And if those agents, acting according to the rules of their agencies (which can't be doubted, since officers in these situations are extremely rarely prosecuted or punished), have denied citizens their rights, including their right to life, then that right must not have existed in the first place, right?","I'm not here to completely change your mind. On the responsibilities note:

My understanding of rights-based political philosophy is that rights are the bare minimum of what peoples generally agree on as the bare minimum of requirements for people to be able to pursue something like freedom or a good life. Rights aren't enabling you to do anything - they are restricting the government from interfering in your life. (The most cited example of this misunderstanding in the US is people who say ridiculous things and then cite the first amendment of the US constitution- the first amendment limits government censorship - not fellow citizens.)

The responsibilities bit is not brought up because (1) it is presupposed that most people won't step-up and (2) taking responsibility in open society has its own rewards. So on the first note, guess what there were drunks/deadbeats/dropouts in every day and age - and so you know that some people aren't even capable of a full public life (ie voting, volunteering, getting involved in the community, stepping up at work, etc, etc). Also, to be fair, a lot political philosophy was only about property-owning men - their very lives were based on their supremacy over everyone else. So for instance, you couldn't argue that non-property owning men and women would have public responsibilities because it would undermine the mental model of inferior women and non-property owners.

Point two, where responsibility is its own reward:
The other aspect of it is that it was assumed that if you became part of public society you got to do all these other fun things: dances, you could network for your job or future wife, meet interesting people, potentially take political office, siphon public funds etc etc.

The rights model is based on a morally-normative model and is therefore problematic. But this was known quite a long time ago: even Spinoza's (mid-1600's) political philosophy, more or less, replaces rights with abilities and interest.

But all philosophy aside- what is of dire interest to me is why Americans seem to be (1) uninterested in history and or (2) unwilling to hold our government to the basic principles of both our constitution and our founding.

It's very interesting to me that people rationalize government misdeeds and overreaches - or make ironic jokes about them. (""I'm sure I'm on a list somewhere."") Or they may simply shrug and say: ""They are only catching the bad guys."" As if that isn't how every horrifying misdeed starts or somehow makes it better that they lied to American congress.

the nature of reddit is present in this sub, what with upvotes, downvotes, etc. but popularity does not equate to deltas.  op decides whether to award a delta. in any case, discussions here typically last as long as the topic continues to get fresh perspectives.  if op doesn't hand out a delta where the popular view is that a delta is earned, or if the discussion devolves into semantics and hair splitting, interest in the discussion wanes.

groupthink depends on the adherence of the accepted opinion as dogma.  challenging these ideas in any real way is out of the question. the entire premise of this sub is to question the views put fourth.

I could be wrong, but groupthink may also be controlled by a fascist regime, which this sub is not.  as far as reddit mods go, r/cmv has mods that seem to prefer the spirit of the law to the letter.  the sub's rules do not seem like they foster groupthink to me.

so, we have a place where ideas are served up for public vivisection.  ideas can freely be challenged and only the op decides whether or not his or her view has been changed.  that seems closer to the socratic method than groupthink.  would you consider the socratic method ""teach me to groupthink""?","Oftentimes, the OP is the person presenting the most common viewpoint, and it's up to the commenters to find a unique argument against it. I say unique because usually, the OP has already considered the most common opposing ideas in advance. In fact, people present mainstream views so often that the moderators created Fresh Topic Friday in order to promote more unique and nonconforming posts. Furthermore, even though I think it's much more difficult to give a delta than to earn one, the system rewards earning them. That means that everyone is competing to have the most unique and compelling post, and the OP is competing to keep his or her view from being changed. I'm not sure how important  internet points are to people, but the scoring system is definitely set up to reward individuality and disincentives group think.

The idea of the sub is not to force people to conform, but rather to provide people with legitimate evidence and logical reasoning that they might not be privy to. 

Additionally, when group think is applied in a logical and critical manner, there is nothing wrong with it. Consider this, if people constantly argue and debate things and *only* change their opinions when presented with solid (logical) reasoning, reasoning which they view as better than their own, the final conclusions reached by the majority of individuals will be the conclusions with the greatest basis in logic and fact. Now, this idea is slightly problematic in that it requires everyone to be logical in their reasoning and to only accept sound arguments. However, this very problem is perhaps one of the reasons reddit, and the internet in general, is a great place for such an activity. As I'm sure you are aware simply from spending time on the internet, people are much less afraid to attack positions aggressively and to present some of their ideals which may normally be less socially acceptable.

I think it is fairly reasonable to conclude from all of this that so long as trolling, fallacies and unproductive behaviors (essentially things against the rules) are: recognized, moderated and, when necessary, ignored or removed, CMV is an excellent avenue for one with an open, yet critical mind to learn a great deal.

"To say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental physiological differences between men and women that feminists appear to disregard. Now, in my opinion feminism seeks to advocate that anything that men can do, women can also but only when its convenient. To me it seems like feminists want to have their cake and eat it too. I will give a few examples that I always think about to illustrate my point.

1. The Ray Rice incident. What happened was unfortunate and of course he shouldn't have hit his wife. However, if this was Ray hanging out with another football player and knocked him out, this would not have been a story. Its because he punched a woman that this became a big deal. How can the feminist movement suggest ""Men should NEVER lay their hands on a woman"" but still say that men and women are equal. My answer is that its because men are generally stronger than women, but then that's my point. If you are going to advocate that they are equal then they should receive equal treatment. Again, CMV.

2. Rape cases. In college I have been required to watch numerous sexual harassment videos and attend mandatory training seminars on sexual assault. In these videos they always paint the male as a bad guy and its always targeted towards men. Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges. Why is this on the guy? People use the phrase ""Victim Blaming"" and say that its not on the girl regardless of the fact that she drunk. So what if she had gotten drunk and drove her car into a tree. Can she then say ""Maybe that wasn't a good idea"" and then get off the hook?

3. The draft. This one has also bothered me. According to the United States Selective Service Act, all men between ages 18-25 are required to register for the draft and may be picked for military service if the draft were to be implemented. Why are feminists all over the country not outraged about this? Shouldn't it be men AND women that are required to register for the draft? After all, men and women should be able to perform wartime duties equally right? It just seems like people pick and choose when its convenient for gender equality

Of course there are certain things that should be equal. Wages, education, etc. However I feel that a push for gender equality in every aspect of life is fundamentally wrong. CMV!

Along that line of thinking, it makes zero sense to advocate for it being okay to hit women or for women needing to register for the draft or to try to revoke the idea that a woman being drunk does not allow for consent. The vast majority of feminists think the draft is wrong, that consent is mutual, and that it is wrong for anyone to hit anyone. But, being feminists, their focus is on womens issues and the issues you describe above are really mens issues - men should not be hit, men cannot consent while drunk, men should not have to register for the draft. That's not to say that feminists don't care about mens issues, but it isn't their main focus.

Now, in my opinion feminism seeks to advocate that anything that men can do, women can also but only when its convenient. To me it seems like feminists want to have their cake and eat it too. I will give a few examples that I always think about to illustrate my point.

1. The Ray Rice incident. What happened was unfortunate and of course he shouldn't have hit his wife. However, if this was Ray hanging out with another football player and knocked him out, this would not have been a story. Its because he punched a woman that this became a big deal. How can the feminist movement suggest ""Men should NEVER lay their hands on a woman"" but still say that men and women are equal. My answer is that its because men are generally stronger than women, but then that's my point. If you are going to advocate that they are equal then they should receive equal treatment. Again, CMV.

2. Rape cases. In college I have been required to watch numerous sexual harassment videos and attend mandatory training seminars on sexual assault. In these videos they always paint the male as a bad guy and its always targeted towards men. Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges. Why is this on the guy? People use the phrase ""Victim Blaming"" and say that its not on the girl regardless of the fact that she drunk. So what if she had gotten drunk and drove her car into a tree. Can she then say ""Maybe that wasn't a good idea"" and then get off the hook?

3. The draft. This one has also bothered me. According to the United States Selective Service Act, all men between ages 18-25 are required to register for the draft and may be picked for military service if the draft were to be implemented. Why are feminists all over the country not outraged about this? Shouldn't it be men AND women that are required to register for the draft? After all, men and women should be able to perform wartime duties equally right? It just seems like people pick and choose when its convenient for gender equality

Of course there are certain things that should be equal. Wages, education, etc. However I feel that a push for gender equality in every aspect of life is fundamentally wrong. CMV!

Men *shouldn't* ever lay a hand on a woman nor should they lay their hand on a man. And when feminists are talking about equality they're not making the claim that women are as physically strong on average as men. They're talking about equal value as a human being in society, not physical prowess.

2. ""Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges."" Is this what really happens most often? Or, is it more often the case that the female is drunk, the man is not, and he takes advantage of the situation. Two drunk people having a one-night stand does not result in rape charges nearly as often as one sober and one drunk/unconscious person does. 

3. First of all, there are feminist groups such as SWAN (Service Women's Action Network) who push for female-inclusion in Selective Service. Second, the Draft is not a relevant issue today. Neither you nor anyone else is going to be drafted any time soon. Feminist groups--like any politically-active group--typically focus on *relevant* issues that actually affect people. So it's no wonder you don't see a lot of attention placed on it by feminist groups because at this point it doesn't really affect anyone one way or the other. Yes, men have to sign up for it, but it's only a relic of a system that is no longer used. If people were actively drafted and the majority of feminists supported the current system, you might have a point. But since the draft is not something that is likely to happen any time in the near future, you can't really blame feminists for wanting focus on more relevant issues.

It's difficult to address your problems with feminism because you haven't brought up any specific examples of mainstream feminists. You have no citations. There are also multiple schools of thought on feminism so I don't know if you're attacking intersectional feminism, third-wave feminism, both, neither, etc.","It's always frustrating when people rail against feminists who say outrageous things without actually providing links to the offending speech, since it forces other feminists to apologize for what might be a misrepresentation of the thing they actually said. But here goes nothing:

1. A feminist might say that men shouldn't use violence against women because men are powerful enough to defend themselves against women without needing to resort to very much violence, or any violence at all. What they're trying to express might be the idea that since you're only justified in using as much force as is reasonable to prevent harm to yourself, and that men could in most cases prevent a woman from inflicting any sort of meaningful harm on them with a very minimal use of force, men shouldn't use very much force when protecting themselves from women. I think this is an overgeneralization; some men are really weak and some women are really strong, and that matters in evaluating when and how much force is justified. Some men are perfectly justified in using a lot of force against a woman to defend themselves. But the underlying principle, that men should be careful not to use too much force when defending themselves against women, is a good one, and I don't think it very charitable to declare all of contemporary feminism flawed because some, *not all*, feminists are making a hasty generalization.

2. This one is easy; a tree is not a moral agent with a duty to respect your autonomy, so getting drunk and crashing into a tree is entirely your fault. However, a person who wants to have sex with you *is* a moral agent with a duty to respect your autonomy, and if such a  person decides to fuck you while your capacity for rational decision making has been subverted by alcohol, they are raping you. So comparing a drunk driving accident to being raped while intoxicated is a disanalogy. Feminists see this bad comparison made *a lot*, so you're not alone in this error. It's like the [Wasson selection task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7NE7apn-PA) of feminist thought.

3. If you ask feminists about the draft, most will give you a two pronged answer; first, that women should be allowed to serve in the military in any capacity in which they are able, including combat, and second, that nobody should be forced to serve against their will. That's an implicit argument that the draft is unjust, so essentially you're asking why feminists aren't outraged that women aren't also subjected to this unjust treatment which men are subjected. If they're right that any sort of draft is unjust, and I think they are, then you're asking feminists to beat women down here rather than raise men up, which is a perverted sort of justice if you ask me. You might want to say that feminists should advocate for ending the draft, and that's fine. Problem is, feminist activists tend to be women, and women are perfectly justified in focusing on issues that affect them. They aren't obligated to focus their activism on men's issues. Feminists who are men are perfectly capable of addressing the draft issue, and should do just that. Heck, you could do that yourself, right now!

Alright, so to wrap this up; if you approach feminism in good faith and in a non-facile way, you're going to find that the project as a whole is not at all flawed or hypocritical. Unfortunately, it's pretty obvious your exposure to feminism has been via the bad faith arguments typical of the MRA/redpill/etc. movements. I highly recommend learning about feminism from sources that aren't explicitly hostile to it. Read bell hooks' [*Feminism is for Everybody*](http://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-bell-hooks/dp/0745317332), it's a really great intro to feminism, especially for people like you who have been exposed to it uncharitably.

&gt;Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.

I've seen people use this quote many times. To me, it's inflammatory anti-religious nonsense. I'm interested to see the other perspective. Have I misunderstood his quote? Is there something about human nature that I've misunderstood?

First of all, I recognize that religion can cause good people to do bad things. It has done it many times and it will continue to do so. ISIS is the most obvious example right now, but there are countless other examples as well.

What I can't understand is the last sentence:

&gt;But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.

He seems to be saying that **only religion** can cause good people to do bad things. This seems like total nonsense to me. TONS of things can cause good people to do bad things.

For example, soldiers who commit war crimes sometimes do so because they were ""just following orders,"" out of a sense of patriotism, or in order to protect their families.

Poverty can make good people do evil things. 

Drugs can, too. They can temporarily taking away people's sanity, which causes them to do stupid things. Or drug addictions can drive people to such financial desperation that they're willing to do evil things to get their next hit.

Let me explain what I understand by ""good people"" and ""evil things."" Perhaps I haven't properly understood what Weinberg meant by these words?

A ""good person"" is someone who wouldn't normally do an evil thing without the influence of some outside force. In the case of this quote, the ""outside force"" is religion.

An ""evil thing"" is anything that society generally sees as extremely bad, such as murder.

Edit: Cleaned the post up a little bit.","This is my first time encountering this quote, but tis is my interpretation:
This quote could be held as true only under the premise that ""religion"" in this case does not refer exclusively to theistic religions. Any system of rituals or beliefs that people follow, including the patriotic following of orders you referred to, is a religion in this context.

As for your other examples, they might be countered in a small variety of ways, depending on the interpreter's beliefs, including something like the following:
-Actions taken by a person in poverty in order to survive are not evil because the person has no alternative
-People who are drugged are not themselves, in that they are controlled by the effects of the substance or addiction thereto.","&gt;convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things.

That depends. When do you define a person by their actions whether they're good and when do you define them by their ideology?

Indoctrination happens in mostly religious households and scenarios. Yes, political as well, but when it comes to beliefs and values I think religion does the indoctrination part a bit more. Especially with the whole ""hell if you don't believe"" idea.

I think that someone isn't a good person if they have an ideology I disagree with. I think nationalists are bad, fascists are bad and so on. So when it comes to ideology, they're not good people doing bad things, they're bad people doing bad things.

He's certainly right when saying with or without religion, good people would do good things and bad people would do evil things.

Some actions aren't evil, yet aren't good either. So maybe good people could do bad things yet not evil.

Theft is an obvious example. It's not a good thing surely, and good people could do this whether or not they were religious, for different reasons. But it's hardly *evil*. Sometimes, theft is necessary or them to survive.
